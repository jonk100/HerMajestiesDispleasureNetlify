ABBEY ROAD STUDIOS - NIGHT (NOVEMBER 1965)\r\n\r\na-The legendary Studio Two is alive with late-night creativity. Instruments scattered everywhere, ashtrays overflowing, empty tea cups forming rings on every surface. The Beatles are deep in the zone, working on what will become their most introspective album.\r\n\r\na-GEORGE sits cross-legged on the floor, a SITAR balanced across his lap. He plucks tentatively at the strings, creating haunting, unfamiliar sounds that seem to float through the studio like incense.\r\n\r\na-JOHN hunches over his acoustic guitar, scribbling lyrics on the back of an envelope. His hair is getting longer, his clothes more casual. There's an intensity to his concentration felt by all in the room.\r\n\r\na-PAUL paces behind the piano, humming a melody, occasionally stopping to play a few bars. His energy is focused but restless.\r\n\r\na-RINGO sits behind his kit, not playing, just listening with the patience of someone who's learned when to wait.\r\n\r\nc-GEORGE\r\np-(to the sitar, frustrated)\r\nd-Go on then... Norwegian wood... what are you trying to tell me?\r\n\r\na-He adjusts his fingers, tries again. The sound is closer to what he wants - mysterious, Eastern, unlike anything The Beatles have done before.\r\n\r\nc-JOHN\r\np-(looking up from his lyrics)\r\nd-Y'allright, our kid? It's not the wood talking. It's you.\r\n\r\nc-PAUL\r\np-(stopping his pacing)\r\nd-Right, but will Radio Caroline play it? Will the kids understand it?\r\n\r\nc-JOHN\r\np-(with edge)\r\nd-Maybe it's time they learned something new, eh? Can't keep singing about holding hands forever, can we?\r\n\r\nc-PAUL\r\nd-I'm not saying we should. I'm just saying we need to bring them with us, not leave them behind.\r\n\r\na-In the control room, visible through the glass, two figures in white coats move about with tea trolleys. NIGEL FINCH, 45, carries himself with the resigned dignity of a man serving Earl Grey when he'd rather be analyzing Soviet missile trajectories. CLIVE BARROW, 38, vibrates with barely contained excitement, treating this assignment like the artistic infiltration of the century.\r\n\r\nc-NIGEL\r\np-(to Clive, under his breath)\r\nd-Remember, we're invisible. Tea service staff are background noise.\r\n\r\nc-CLIVE\r\np-(whispering intensely)\r\nd-Do you realize what we're witnessing? The birth of a new aesthetic paradigm! This is... this is revolutionary consciousness emerging through sonic experimentation!\r\n\r\nc-NIGEL\r\nd-It's a guitar with extra strings, Clive.\r\n\r\na-Clive pulls out a small notebook and begins scribbling frantically.\r\n\r\nc-CLIVE\r\np-(writing)\r\nd-\"Subject Harrison exploring Eastern mysticisms... possible Communist influences... through Indian classical music...\"\r\n\r\na-Nigel looks over at Clive's notebook, sighs, and shakes his head with frustration before collecting himself.\r\n\r\nc-NIGEL\r\nd-Clive, the sitar is not a Communist plot.\r\n\r\nc-CLIVE\r\np-(frustration bubbling in his eyes)\r\nd-What? How can you be certain?\r\np-(a look of wonder enters his eyes)\r\nd-What if the strings are tuned to... to Marxist frequencies? Or worse?\r\n\r\na-Nigel stares at him for a long moment, then picks up the tea tray.\r\n\r\nc-NIGEL\r\nd-I'm going to serve tea.\r\n\r\na-He enters the studio proper, moving with professional invisibility.\r\n\r\nc-NIGEL\r\np-(politely)\r\nd-Tea, gentlemen?\r\n\r\na-The Beatles barely acknowledge him - they're too deep in their creative process. George continues working with the sitar, now finding a haunting melody that weaves through \"Norwegian Wood.\"\r\n\r\nc-JOHN\r\np-(to George, excited)\r\nd-That's it! That's the sound I was hearing in my head. Like... like memories of a place you've never been.\r\n\r\nc-GEORGE\r\np-(pleased but philosophical)\r\nd-That's the thing though, isn't it? The music.. It takes you to the places that don't yet exist.\r\n\r\na-Paul sits at the piano, begins playing the opening chords of what will become \"In My Life.\" The melody is wistful, mature, a step up from their earlier work.\r\n\r\nc-PAUL\r\np-(singing softly)\r\nd-\"There are places I remember... all my life though some have changed...\"\r\n\r\nc-JOHN\r\np-(joining in, harmonizing)\r\nd-\"Some forever, not for better... some have gone and some remain...\"\r\n\r\na-Nigel sets down tea cups, his movements precise and unobtrusive. But his eyes are alert, taking in everything. Like Clive, he recognizes something significant is happening - he's just self-aware enough to know that he'll never understand what.\r\n\r\nc-RINGO\r\np-(to no one in particular)\r\nd-Funny how growing up makes you look backwards, isn't it?\r\n\r\nc-JOHN\r\np-(looking up from his lyrics)\r\nd-That's exactly what this is about, our kid. All these places and people that shaped us... but now we're free to explore... to become something different, aren't we?.\r\n\r\na-He holds up the envelope with his lyrics.\r\n\r\nc-JOHN (CONT'D)\r\nd-\"Though I know I'll never lose affection for people and things that went before...\"\r\n\r\nc-PAUL\r\np-(nodding)\r\nd-\"I know I'll often stop and think about them...\"\r\n\r\nc-GEORGE\r\np-(still playing the sitar)\r\nd-It's like... maya. The illusion of permanence. Everything changes, but the love remains.\r\n\r\nc-PAUL\r\np-(slightly confused)\r\nd-Maya?\r\n\r\nc-GEORGE\r\nd-Hindu concept. The world as we see it is just... surface. Underneath, everything's connected.\r\n\r\na-In the control room, Clive is practically hyperventilating.\r\n\r\nc-CLIVE\r\np-(scribbling furiously)\r\nd-\"Hindu concepts... Eastern philosophy... Subject Harrison is likely under foreign influence\"\r\n\r\na-Through the glass, he watches George demonstrate a basic sitar technique to John, who tries to replicate it on his guitar.\r\n\r\nc-CLIVE (CONT'D)\r\np-(to himself)\r\nd-This is it. This is how they mean to corrupt the youth. Through... through transcendental guitar technique... What else could all those extra strings be for?\r\n\r\na-Nigel returns to the control room, sets down the empty tea tray.\r\n\r\nc-NIGEL\r\nd-Any earth-shattering discoveries while I was gone?\r\n\r\nc-CLIVE\r\np-(breathless)\r\nd-Nigel, they're discussing Hindu philosophy! And look at Lennon's lyrics - \"places I remember, not for better\".... \"lost affection for the people and things that went before\" - clearly a rejection of British traditions!\r\n\r\na-A small beep. Nigel touches a button on his earpiece.\r\n\r\nc-NIGEL\r\np-(after a pause)\r\nd-No sign of Mr. Epstein, sir. Assume he remains focused on the Mayfair aesthetic matrix.\r\n\r\na-Nigel takes a deep breath and directs his attention back to Clive.\r\n\r\nc-NIGEL\r\nd-Or... And he me out...\r\np-(looking through the glass)\r\nd-They're writing songs about growing up.\r\n\r\na-On the studio floor, the four Beatles are now gathered around George's sitar. There's something almost ritualistic about the moment - four young men from Liverpool discovering sounds that will change popular music forever.\r\n\r\nc-JOHN\r\np-(thoughtful)\r\nd-You know what's mad? Six months ago we were singing \"Help!\" and now...\r\n\r\na-He gestures at the sitar, at Paul's introspective piano melody, at the notebooks full of philosophical lyrics.\r\n\r\nc-JOHN (CONT'D)\r\nd-Now we're trying to figure out what it all means.\r\n\r\nc-PAUL\r\nd-Maybe that's what happens when you stop running long enough to think.\r\n\r\nc-GEORGE\r\np-(smiling)\r\nd-Maybe the music's just catching up with who we really are.\r\n\r\nc-RINGO\r\np-(with his characteristic wisdom)\r\nd-Either way, it's going to confuse the shite out of people.\r\n\r\na-They all laugh - a moment of genuine camaraderie before the storm that's coming.\r\n\r\na-In the control room, Clive closes his notebook with satisfaction.\r\n\r\nC-CLIVE\r\np-(to Nigel)\r\nd-Mark my words - this \"Rubber Soul\" album will be the beginning of their downfall. All this introspection and Eastern influence... it's exactly the kind of intellectual pretension that alienates the common man.\r\n\r\nc-NIGEL\r\np-(dryly)\r\nd-Yes, Clive. I'm sure the British public will be horrified by thoughtful lyrics.\r\n\r\nc-CLIVE\r\nd-You'll see. This is where Operation Minuet begins to bear fruit. They're destroying themselves... with artistic ambition!\r\n\r\na-Through the glass, The Beatles continue working, unaware they're being watched, unaware that their natural evolution as artists is being interpreted as subversion.\r\n\r\na-We drift back from the control room window, holding both worlds in frame - the creative chaos of the studio and the sterile paranoia of the surveillance booth.","src/content/scenes/act-1/s10-rubber-soul-sessions.mdx","fc1cabccd1196c82","act-1/s10-rubber-soul-sessions.mdx","act-1/s11-beatlemania-undiminished",{id:71,data:73,body:92,filePath:93,digest:94,legacyId:95,deferredRender:42},{title:74,act:15,sequence:47,scene_number:75,scene_type:76,location:77,time_of_day:20,characters:82,purpose:86,conflict:87,emotional_beat:88,page_count:89,status:35,notes:90,created:91},"Beatlemania Undiminished",11,"montage",[78,80],{id:79,collection:19},"buckingham-palace-study",{id:81,collection:19},"mi5-surveillance-van",[83,85],{id:84,collection:24},"royalty/prince-phillip",{id:58,collection:24},"Establish the Beatles' peak popularity and cultural dominance, making Philip's mission seem both more urgent and more impossible","The overwhelming success of Rubber Soul versus Philip's growing determination to stop The Beatles' cultural influence","Philip's mounting frustration as he realizes the true scale of what he's up against, while Nigel begins to grasp the impossibility of their mission",2,"Montage sequence showing Rubber Soul's massive success intercut with Philip's reactions.

Stacks and stacks of them—philosophy, religion, Eastern mysticism, poetry—cover every surface like intellectual debris.\r\n\r\na-JOHN LENNON (25) sits cross-legged on the Persian carpet, surrounded by open books. His hair is getting longer, his clothes more casual. He’s deeply absorbed in reading *The Passover Plot* by Hugh J. Schonfield, making notes in the margins with intense concentration.\r\n\r\na-Scattered around him: *The Tibetan Book of the Dead*, works by Aldous Huxley, books on Hinduism and Buddhism, volumes of poetry. This isn’t casual reading—this is a man desperately searching for something.\r\n\r\nc-JOHN\r\np-(reading aloud, to himself)\r\nd-\"The historical Jesus was a man, not a god... the Christ of faith is a creation of the early church...\"\r\n\r\na-He looks up from the book, staring out the large window at the manicured suburban landscape. His expression is troubled, questioning.\r\n\r\nc-JOHN (CONT’D)\r\np-(quietly)\r\nd-If that’s true... then what exactly have we all been believing?\r\n\r\na-CYNTHIA LENNON (26) enters carrying a tea tray. She’s blonde, pretty, but there’s worry in her eyes as she surveys the chaos of books and her increasingly distant husband.\r\n\r\nc-CYNTHIA\r\nd-John? I’ve brought you some tea.\r\n\r\na-John doesn’t look up, already reaching for another book—this one on Eastern philosophy.\r\n\r\nc-JOHN\r\np-(distracted)\r\nd-Mmm. Thanks, love.\r\n\r\na-Cynthia sets the tray down carefully, moving books to make space. She picks up *The Tibetan Book of the Dead*, examining it with concern.\r\n\r\nc-CYNTHIA\r\nd-John... you’ve been reading for hours. Julian’s been asking for his daddy.\r\n\r\nc-JOHN\r\np-(still reading)\r\nd-In a minute, Cyn. This is... this is important.\r\n\r\na-He holds up a passage from the philosophy book.\r\n\r\nc-JOHN (CONT’D)\r\np-(excited, finally looking at her)\r\nd-Listen to this—“All conditioned things are impermanent. Work out your salvation with diligence.” Buddha’s last words. Doesn’t that just... doesn’t that change everything?\r\n\r\nc-CYNTHIA\r\np-(gently)\r\nd-I don’t know, love. Does it?\r\n\r\nc-JOHN\r\np-(growing animated)\r\nd-Don’t you see? We’ve been living this... this illusion. Fame, money, screaming fans—it’s all maya. Hindu concept. It means illusion, the veil that covers reality.\r\n\r\na-Cynthia sits on the edge of the sofa, watching her husband with growing concern.\r\n\r\nc-CYNTHIA\r\nd-You sound like George with all his Indian music talk.\r\n\r\nc-JOHN\r\np-(defensive)\r\nd-Maybe George is onto something. Maybe we all are. Maybe that’s why the music’s changing, why we can’t just sing “Love Me Do” anymore.\r\n\r\na-He gestures at the books around him.\r\n\r\nc-JOHN (CONT’D)\r\nd-There’s got to be more than this, Cyn. More than just... being famous.\r\n\r\nc-CYNTHIA\r\np-(worried)\r\nd-But John... you’re scaring me a bit. All this talk about illusions and... and questioning everything. What about us? What about Julian? Are we illusions too?\r\n\r\na-John looks at her. His intensity softens.\r\n\r\nc-JOHN\r\np-(reaching for her hand)\r\nd-No, love. You’re real. Julian’s real. It’s just... everything else. The whole bloody circus.\r\n\r\na-He picks up a newspaper from the coffee table—headlines about Beatles tours, fan hysteria, commercial success.\r\n\r\nc-JOHN (CONT’D)\r\nd-Look at this. “Beatles Conquer America Again.” “Rubber Soul Breaks Records.” It’s like we’re not even people anymore. We’re... products.\r\n\r\nc-CYNTHIA\r\nd-Maybe you need to get out more. See people. Instead of just... reading all the time.\r\n\r\nc-JOHN\r\np-(with a bitter laugh)\r\nd-See people? Cyn, I can’t walk down the street without being mobbed. This house is the only place I can think.\r\n\r\na-He stands, walks to the window, staring out at suburban perfection.\r\n\r\nc-JOHN (CONT’D)\r\nd-Sometimes I feel like I’m disappearing. Like John Lennon the person is being eaten alive by John Lennon the Beatle.\r\n\r\ns-EXT. JOHN'S WEYBRIDGE HOME - CONTINUOUS\r\n\r\na-Across the street, NIGEL FINCH sits in a nondescript sedan, watching the house through binoculars. A notebook rests on his lap.\r\n\r\nc-NIGEL\r\np-(into small tape recorder)\r\nd-Subject continues extensive reading program. Observed titles include works on Eastern religion, alternative Christianity, and...\r\n\r\na-He adjusts the binoculars, squinting at book spines through the window.\r\n\r\nc-NIGEL (CONT’D)\r\nd-...what appears to be Buddhist philosophy.

Possible radicalization in progress. Increased isolation may be accelerating ideological drift.\r\n\r\na-He lowers the binoculars, writes: “Day 47 — Intellectual subversion continues.”\r\n\r\ns-INT. JOHN'S WEYBRIDGE HOME - CONTINUOUS\r\n\r\na-John is back on the floor, reading from a book on comparative religion. Cynthia watches uneasily.\r\n\r\nc-JOHN\r\np-(reading aloud)\r\nd-“The kingdom of heaven is within you.” That’s what Jesus actually said. Not in some church. Not through some priest. Within you.\r\n\r\na-He looks up, eyes alight.\r\n\r\nc-JOHN (CONT’D)\r\nd-What if organized religion got it all wrong, Cyn? What if the real message got buried under centuries of politics and power?\r\n\r\nc-CYNTHIA\r\np-(quietly)\r\nd-John... you’re starting to sound like you think you know better than the Church of England.\r\n\r\nc-JOHN\r\np-(with conviction)\r\nd-Maybe I do. Maybe we all do, if we just think for ourselves.\r\n\r\na-He picks up *The Passover Plot*.\r\n\r\nc-JOHN (CONT’D)\r\nd-Schonfield traces how the Jesus story got changed. Mythologized. The real Jesus was probably just a teacher. Like Buddha. Like anyone who tries to wake people up.\r\n\r\na-Cynthia stands.\r\n\r\nc-CYNTHIA\r\nd-I think I’ll go check on Julian.\r\n\r\nc-JOHN\r\np-(oblivious)\r\nd-You know what’s mad? We probably reach more people with our music than Jesus ever did.\r\n\r\na-Cynthia pauses at the doorway.\r\n\r\nc-CYNTHIA\r\np-(quietly)\r\nd-Just be careful, John. Some thoughts are dangerous to think out loud.\r\n\r\na-She exits. John stares at the window.\r\n\r\nc-JOHN\r\np-(to himself)\r\nd-If Christianity is just another myth... then what else are we meant to believe without question?\r\n\r\ns-EXT.

BRIAN EPSTEIN'S OFFICE - DAY (FEBRUARY 1966)\r\na-A tastefully modern office in central London. Sleek furniture, framed Beatles memorabilia on the walls. The large desk is a model of organized chaos: neat stacks of contracts, a brimming but orderly inbox tray, and a leather-bound calendar filled with appointments.\r\n\r\na-MAUREEN CLEAVE, 32, sits comfortably but alert across from BRIAN EPSTEIN, 31, who reviews a document with subtle intensity.\r\n\r\nc-MAUREEN\r\nd-I'm not interested in fluff, Brian. This isn't for a teen mag. I want real access. Thoughtful conversations, not just press quotes.\r\n\r\na-Epstein doesn't look up.\r\n\r\nc-EPSTEIN\r\nd-You have invariably shown finer judgement than most, Maureen. John recognises that.\r\n\r\nc-MAUREEN\r\nd-It's not just John. I want to do all four of the boys — individually. Where they live. Who they are when the fans aren't watching.\r\n\r\na-He finally meets her gaze.\r\n\r\nc-EPSTEIN\r\nd-And what are you hoping to find?\r\n\r\nc-MAUREEN\r\np-(with increasing firmness)\r\nd-Who they're becoming. Not the legend — just the men. It's clear the roles are evolving. Paul's the diplomat. George is searching. Ringo's observing everything. And John... well, he's in flux.\r\n\r\nc-EPSTEIN\r\np-(quietly amused)\r\nd-Flux is one word for it.\r\n\r\nc-MAUREEN\r\nd-The Evening Standard wants this series. So do I. But more than that — I think the public's ready to know them as individuals. Not just mop-tops in suits.\r\n\r\na-Epstein rises and moves toward the window. Thoughtful. He lights a cigarette.\r\n\r\nc-EPSTEIN\r\nd-You realize what you're asking, Maureen. Privacy is sacred. Especially to John. And George's home is practically a temple now.\r\n\r\nc-MAUREEN\r\nd-No photographers. Just me, a recorder, and a notebook. No entourage. No gotcha questions. They know that's not my style.\r\n\r\na-Epstein pauses, staring through her, calculating.\r\n\r\nc-EPSTEIN\r\nd-We should consider the terms of engagement. No entourage is acceptable. We'll retain copy approval for factual accuracy, naturally. But the substance — the tone — I don't need surprises right now.\r\n\r\nc-MAUREEN\r\nd-You'll have copy approval for factual accuracy. But the substance — their words, their tone, the framing — that stays mine.\r\n\r\na-Epstein takes a long drag on his cigarette. Considering. Cautiously.\r\n\r\nc-EPSTEIN\r\nd-You'll begin with John?\r\n\r\nc-MAUREEN\r\nd-If he's willing.\r\n\r\nc-EPSTEIN\r\nd-He will be. He's been restless. Daring someone to ask real questions. Just...\r\np-(again, calculating)\r\nd-We must be careful. His honesty can be utterly forthright when his mind is engaged.\r\n\r\nc-MAUREEN\r\nd-I'd expect nothing less.\r\n\r\na-Epstein returns to his desk and opens a small leather-bound address book.\r\n\r\nc-EPSTEIN\r\nd-I'll schedule it for next week. Kenwood. Weybridge. My office will coordinate with you.\r\n\r\nc-MAUREEN\r\nd-Thank you, Brian.\r\n\r\na-She stands to leave. A soft BUZZ from the intercom. Epstein presses a button, lighting a second cigarette from the first.\r\n\r\nc-EPSTEIN\r\np-(into intercom)\r\nd-Yes, Wendy?\r\n\r\nc-WENDY (V.O.)\r\nd-Mr. Epstein, the American tour promoters are here for the two o'clock.\r\n\r\nc-EPSTEIN (CONT'D)\r\np-glancing at his watch.\r\nd-Thanks, Wendy. Give me two minutes.\r\n\r\na-He releases the button and turns fully back to Maureen. The outside chaos held at bay.\r\n\r\nc-EPSTEIN\r\nd-This isn't about headlines. It's about their respectability. Remember that when he starts talking... consider where those words might travel.\r\n\r\nc-MAUREEN\r\nd-I will.\r\n\r\na-As Maureen exits quietly, Brian sighs and watches the door close behind her. \r\n\r\nc-EPSTEIN\r\np-under his breath\r\nd-Let's hope the world's ready to hear what he has to say.\r\n\r\na-He sighs deeply again and leans back, gazing at the London skyline. Alone now, the control slips. He pulls a bottle of pills from a desk drawer, casually tosses a handful in his mouth, closes his eyes and swallows.","src/content/scenes/act-1/s15-negotiations.mdx","db063237d903d5cc","act-1/s15-negotiations.mdx","act-1/s14-the-journalist",{id:135,data:137,body:152,filePath:153,digest:154,legacyId:155,deferredRender:42},{title:138,act:15,sequence:120,scene_number:139,scene_type:16,location:140,time_of_day:20,characters:142,purpose:147,conflict:148,emotional_beat:149,page_count:89,status:35,notes:150,created:151},"The Journalist",14,{id:141,collection:19},"evening-standard-office",[143,145,146],{id:144,collection:24},"misc/maureen-cleave",{id:60,collection:24},{id:58,collection:24},"Introduce Maureen Cleave as an unwitting catalyst, show MI5's paranoid misinterpretation of normal journalism","Professional journalism versus MI5's paranoid surveillance and misinterpretation of normal press activity","The irony that genuine journalistic curiosity is being interpreted as a coordinated attack by increasingly paranoid intelligence operatives","Focus on Maureen's legitimate journalistic interest in The Beatles' evolution contrasted with Clive's ridiculous misinterpretation.

The cover reads \"PAUL'S FAVORITE FOODS.\" She rolls her eyes.\r\n\r\na-Her own desk is crowded with Beatles coverage.

His fingers idly drift into the iconic opening chords of \"Yesterday,\" a moment of muscle memory. He catches himself, a small, private smile on his face -- that was then.

EMI STUDIOS, STUDIO ONE - DAY:\r\na-The vast, hallowed space, normally home to rock and roll, is now filled with a 30-PIECE ORCHESTRA. String, woodwind, and brass sections, all in formal attire. The air is one of hushed, professional reverence.\r\n\r\na-Paul stands beside the CONDUCTOR (60s, distinguished, a George Martin type), looking slightly out of his element but exuding a quiet confidence. He's listening intently, the professional.\r\n\r\nc-PAUL\r\np-(quietly, to the Conductor)\r\nd-It needs to feel hopeful, but with a bit of a northern sadness to it. You know?

There is a moment of silence, then the musicians lightly tap their bows on their music stands in a sign of professional respect.\r\n\r\na-Paul beams.

Books everywhere. On the cluttered coffee table: notebooks, tea cups, a dog-eared paperback — ALDOUS HUXLEY, “THE DOORS OF PERCEPTION,” and eight small green boxes with winking red lights. JOHN LENNON, 25, pokes one whose light has just died.\r\n\r\nc-JOHN\r\np-(to himself)\r\nd-Another one gone...\r\n\r\na-He settles back into his armchair, a cup of tea balanced precariously. Casual sweater and jeans. Hair longer now, falling across his forehead. Relaxed. At ease.\r\n\r\na-MAUREEN CLEAVE, 32, sits opposite him. Notebook open. Tape recorder on the table between them. Her eyes move along the shelves: poetry, paperbacks, philosophy. COLIN WILSON. “THE OUTSIDER.”\r\n\r\na-The atmosphere is intimate and conversational — two intelligent people thinking aloud.\r\n\r\nc-MAUREEN\r\nd-I have to say, John, this isn’t what most people would expect from a pop star’s living room.\r\n\r\nc-JOHN\r\np-smiling slightly\r\nd-What would they expect? Gold records on the walls and a jukebox?\r\n\r\nc-MAUREEN\r\nd-Something like that. Instead, I see...\r\n\r\na-She picks up a book.\r\n\r\nc-MAUREEN (CONT'D)\r\nd-Hugh Schonfield. THE PASSOVER PLOT. Not exactly typical reading for someone who sings “She Loves You.”\r\n\r\na-John leans forward with excitement.\r\n\r\nc-JOHN\r\np-animated\r\nd-That’s exactly the point, isn’t it? Everyone thinks because we sing pop songs, we must be empty-headed. But why can’t you make music and think at the same time?\r\n\r\na-John reaches for another book, sets it down without ceremony: BERTRAND RUSSELL. “WHY I AM NOT A CHRISTIAN.”\r\n\r\nc-JOHN (CONT'D)\r\nd-I read everything I can get my hands on. Philosophy, religion, poetry. The more famous we get, the more I realize how little I actually know about… well, everything.\r\n\r\nc-MAUREEN\r\np-scribbling with a practiced ease\r\nd-And what are you discovering in all this reading?\r\n\r\nc-JOHN\r\np-(thoughtful)\r\nd-That most of what we’re taught to believe is just… stories. Useful stories, maybe, but stories nonetheless.\r\n\r\na-He picks up a slim volume. D.T. SUZUKI. “ZEN BUDDHISM.”\r\n\r\nc-JOHN (CONT'D)\r\nd-Take Christianity. I was brought up Church of England, like most people. But then you read about other religions, other ways of thinking, and you realize… it’s all just different attempts to explain the same mysteries.\r\n\r\nc-MAUREEN\r\nd-That’s quite a shift from your Liverpool upbringing.\r\n\r\nc-JOHN\r\np-(laughing)\r\nd-My Aunt Mimi would have a fit if she heard me now. But that’s what happens when you start thinking for yourself instead of just accepting what you’re told.\r\n\r\na-Maureen studies her notes, then looks up.\r\n\r\nc-MAUREEN\r\nd-You mentioned Christianity specifically. How do you see its role in modern Britain?\r\n\r\nc-JOHN\r\np-settling back\r\nd-Honestly? I think it’s dying. Not the ideas — some of the ideas are brilliant. Love your neighbor, help the poor, all that. But the institution, the organized bit...\r\n\r\na-He shakes his head.\r\n\r\nc-JOHN (CONT'D)\r\nd-Look around. How many young people do you know who actually go to church? Who really believe in all the ritual and ceremony?\r\n\r\nc-MAUREEN\r\nd-And you think that’s significant?\r\n\r\nc-JOHN\r\np-warming to the subject.\r\nd-I think it’s inevitable. Christianity will go. It will vanish and shrink. I needn’t argue about that; I’m right and I will be proved right.\r\n\r\na-He pauses, takes a sip of tea. Then, still casually—\r\n\r\nc-JOHN (CONT'D)\r\nd-We’re more popular than Jesus now. I don’t know which will go first, rock ’n’ roll or Christianity. Jesus was all right, but his disciples were thick and ordinary. It’s them twisting it that ruins it for me.\r\n\r\na-The words hang briefly. No drama. No emphasis. Maureen writes it down like any other observation.\r\n\r\nc-MAUREEN\r\np-(thoughtful)\r\nd-That’s quite a statement.\r\n\r\nc-JOHN\r\np-(shrugging)\r\nd-Is it? Look at the evidence. We fill stadiums with kids who know every word to our songs. When’s the last time you saw that kind of passion in a church?\r\n\r\na-He leans forward, earnest.\r\n\r\nc-JOHN (CONT'D)\r\nd-I’m not saying it’s good or bad. I’m just observing what’s happening. The world’s changing. Young people are looking for meaning in different places.\r\n\r\nc-MAUREEN\r\nd-And you think pop music is providing that meaning?\r\n\r\nc-JOHN\r\np-(considering)\r\nd-Some of it, maybe. When we sing about love, or confusion, or growing up… maybe that speaks more directly than ancient parables.\r\n\r\na-He picks up RUBBER SOUL.\r\n\r\nc-JOHN (CONT'D)\r\nd-We’re trying to say something real here. About memory. Change. Searching for something deeper than entertainment.\r\n\r\nc-MAUREEN\r\nd-So you see The Beatles as having a kind of… spiritual influence?\r\n\r\nc-JOHN\r\np-(uncomfortable)\r\nd-God, no. Don’t make us sound like prophets. We’re just four lads from Liverpool who got lucky.\r\n\r\na-He trails, then looks at her.\r\n\r\nc-JOHN (CONT'D)\r\nd-But if our music helps people think, or feel less alone, or question things they’ve taken for granted… maybe that’s useful.\r\n\r\ns-EXT.

Dead monarchs watch from the walls.\r\n\r\na-QUEEN ELIZABETH II (39) stands on the dais, a portrait of practiced duty.\r\n\r\na-At a respectful distance, PRINCE PHILIP (44) watches — hands clasped behind his back, posture ramrod straight. Beside him, his uncle, LORD MOUNTBATTEN (65), surveys the room with the cool, analytical gaze of a strategist.\r\n\r\na-THE BEATLES — JOHN, PAUL, GEORGE, and RINGO — wait their turn. They look impossibly young in their dark suits, shifting their weight, a nervous energy contained within the room's crushing formality.\r\n\r\na-Paul flashes a quick, charming smile when he catches the Queen's eye. Ringo looks genuinely thrilled to be there.

George with a quiet, respectful nod. Ringo with a wide, happy grin.\r\n\r\na- Then John steps forward. He gives a nod and takes the medal from the Queen, his eyes darting around the room for a moment, taking in the absurdity of it all.\r\n\r\na- To anyone else, it's nothing.

A decanter of whiskey sits on a silver tray. The air is thick with unspoken tension.\r\n\r\na-PRINCE PHILIP stands by the fireplace, rigid with controlled fury. LORD MOUNTBATTEN sits in a wingback chair, observing. A man who has mastered the control of his emotion.\r\n\r\na-QUEEN ELIZABETH II sits opposite him, hands folded in her lap. A corgi sleeps at her feet. She is a small island of calm in her husband's tempest.\r\n\r\nc-PRINCE PHILIP\r\nd-It's a complete mockery. Not just of the honour, but of the entire system. All of us.\r\n\r\na-He turns from the fire.\r\n\r\nc-PRINCE PHILIP (CONT'D)\r\np-(low and intense)\r\nd-I wore that uniform. I served on those ships. I knew men who received these medals — many posthumously — for doing their duty without question or comment. And we give the same honour to a... a popinjay who jokes about \"killing people\" for it.\r\np-(gesturing dismissively)\r\nd-And, of course, the press lap it up. They treat him like a philosopher king. This is how it starts. The slow, steady erosion of respect. A complete failure to understand the proper order of things.\r\n\r\na-The Queen rises calmly and moves to a side table, adjusting a silver-framed photograph by a fraction of an inch. A small act of order in the face of chaos.\r\n\r\nc-QUEEN ELIZABETH II\r\np-(quietly, her back to them)\r\nd-The Crown has weathered unruly poets, pamphleteers, and public figures of every stripe. They are dramatic, their time passes, and the institution endures. One imagines the best course of action is simply to ignore it. It will be forgotten in a week.\r\n\r\nc-PRINCE PHILIP\r\nd-Will it? Or will it be seen as yet another sign that we have no authority? That we are irrelevant? This is not just a family, it's a firm. And we must protect our interests.\r\n\r\na-He looks to his uncle for support. Mountbatten takes a slow, deliberate sip of his whiskey, allowing the silence to hang.\r\n\r\nc-LORD MOUNTBATTEN\r\nd-Her Majesty's caution is, as always, wise. A direct response would be disastrous. It would make them martyrs.\r\nYou know, Philip, in my day we fought actual revolutionaries. Communists. Anarchists. People with guns and manifestos. Not... whatever these rapscallions are up to.\r\n\r\na-Philip glares.\r\n\r\nc-LORD MOUNTBATTEN (CONT'D)\r\np-(leaning forward)\r\nd-But you're right. Cultural power is still power. And they're wielding it, whether they know it or not. So yes, we'll handle it. Quietly. Strategically.\r\np-(smiling faintly)\r\nd-Consider it a training exercise. If we can't outmanoeuvre four musicians from Liverpool, we've no business running an intelligence service.\r\n\r\na-The Queen turns, intrigued by the re-framing.\r\n\r\nc-LORD MOUNTBATTEN (CONT'D)\r\np-(back to his stern, commanding presence)\r\nd-They are creating a new form of nationalism. Not loyalty to a country, but to a culture. To a tribe. It has its own anthems, its own leaders, its own symbols. It operates entirely outside our control. We can't command it, so we must persuade it. Or, failing that, dismantle it.\r\n\r\nc-PRINCE PHILIP\r\nd-Dismantle it? We can't have them arrested for irritating us anymore, Dickie.\r\n\r\nc-LORD MOUNTBATTEN\r\nd-Of course not. One doesn't use a battleship to sink a canoe. This requires a more... subtle approach. It's psychological. Think of them not as a monolith, but as a structure with existing fissures. We apply quiet, steady pressure to the weakest points, and they fracture from within.\r\n\r\na-He lets the idea hang in the air, his tone both charming and chilling.\r\n\r\nc-LORD MOUNTBATTEN (CONT'D)\r\nd-We amplify their natural tensions. We encourage their worst impulses. Lennon's paranoia. McCartney's ambition. Harrison's... spiritual wanderings. One doesn't send a gunboat. One simply ensures the right book on Eastern mysticism finds its way into the right hands at the right time.\r\np-(a faint, self-satisfied smile)\r\nd-My great gift, as you know, is to accelerate the inevitable.\r\n\r\na-He lets the words hang in the air for a beat before delivering the name with the finality of a war command.\r\n\r\nc-LORD MOUNTBATTEN (CONT'D)\r\nd-We shall call it Operation Minuet. A delicate dance, performed in the shadows.\r\n\r\na-Philip's anger begins to cool, replaced by the focused intensity of a commander. He likes this. It's a plan.\r\n\r\nc-PRINCE PHILIP\r\nd-Operation Minuet. And who executes this dance?\r\n\r\nc-LORD MOUNTBATTEN\r\nd-I have men at the firm. Not my finest, I'll admit, but suitable for this kind of work. They understand the art of the nudge.\r\n\r\na-Philip nods, satisfied. He finally sits down, the immediate crisis replaced with a long-term strategy. He looks to his wife. There is an urgency in his eyes — a plea for her to see the necessity.\r\n\r\na-The Queen is silent for a long moment, stroking her sleeping dog. She meets her husband's gaze, her own unreadable, before looking away toward the dark window.\r\n\r\nc-QUEEN ELIZABETH II\r\nd-And one presumes this Operation Minuet has a budget?\r\n\r\na-Mountbatten and Philip exchange a look.

MI5 BRIEFING ROOM - DAY\r\na-The room is an exercise in government-mandated misery. Fluorescent lights hum over a scarred wooden table.\r\n\r\na-SIR DEREK FINCHLEY (54), impeccably dressed, sits at the head of the table, a picture of calm authority. Beside him, LORD MOUNTBATTEN's (65) presence lends the drab room an unearned gravity.\r\n\r\na-Across from them sit NIGEL FINCH (48) and CLIVE BARROW (41). Nigel is perfectly still, his hands clasped around a pen, his expression neutral. Clive fidgets, buzzing with an energy the room cannot contain, his eyes darting between the two powerful men.\r\n\r\nc-SIR DEREK\r\nd-Gentlemen. Thank you for coming. We have a matter of some national sensitivity. A delicate but vital undertaking that requires the utmost discretion.\r\n\r\na-He pulls a thin folder from his very fancy, oversized briefcase and slides it across the table. It is labeled \"OPERATION MINUET\".\r\n\r\nc-SIR DEREK (CONT'D)\r\nd-This initiative concerns a unique cultural asset. One that has... begun to operate outside of its preferred parameters.\r\n\r\na-Mountbatten cuts in, his voice like iron.\r\n\r\nc-LORD MOUNTBATTEN\r\nd-To be precise, it's become a cultural threat. Their influence is organic and it's spreading... It's infectious - cancerous. It can't be commanded, and must be managed with nuance.\r\n\r\na-Clive leans forward, his eyes wide with excitement. He opens the folder and his face lights up.\r\n\r\nc-CLIVE\r\nd-The Beatles. Of course. A classic case of aesthetic subversion! Their semiotic framework is... it's pure psychological warfare wrapped in a three-minute pop song! We must eradicate this disease!\r\n\r\na-Nigel slowly closes his eyes for a single, weary beat. Two fingers land on each temple as he opens his eyes and looks at Sir Derek.\r\n\r\nc-NIGEL\r\nd-And the objective, sir? What, precisely, are we to... achieve?\r\n\r\nc-SIR DEREK\r\nd-An excellent question, Nigel. The objective is not elimination, but realignment. We encourage the existing entropic forces within the group dynamic. We help them fall apart. Lord Mountbatten has devised a multi-pronged approach.\r\n\r\na-Mountbatten points a finger at Clive.\r\n\r\nc-LORD MOUNTBATTEN\r\nd-Barrow. You'll take the primary asset. Lennon. The file suggests he is prone to paranoia, intellectual vanity, and grandiosity. Your job is to amplify those traits. Feed his ego. Make him believe he is a revolutionary, not a pop star. He must become the public threat we already perceive him to be.\r\n\r\nc-CLIVE\r\np-(breathless)\r\nd-A... cognitive infiltration. Sir, I've spent significant time developing a methodology, perfect for this. I call it 'The Klaus Technique'. I pose as a German art critic... discuss the Situationalists... Guy Debroad, perhaps. I gain his trust through aesthetic symbiosis... It's truly revolutionary.\r\n\r\na-Nigel makes a small, almost inaudible sigh. Mountbatten ignores Clive's outburst and turns to Nigel.\r\n\r\nc-LORD MOUNTBATTEN\r\nd-Finch. You will take the other two. McCartney and Harrison. McCartney fancies himself a diplomat, a traditionalist. We will flatter that. Make him feel the establishment values him more. Create an ideological wedge. As for Harrison... the file is thin. He seems interested in... sitars.\r\n\r\nc-NIGEL\r\nd-... Sitars, sir?\r\n\r\nc-LORD MOUNTBATTEN\r\nd-Indeed. Some sort of guitar-harp hybrid as I understand it. Nurture that. A man focused on finding the perfect drone is a man less focused on the team. It's a simple pressure point.\r\n\r\na-Nigel does his best to get something down in his notebook, but after crossing out several misspellings of sitar, just ends up with: \"ENCOURAGE SITAR STUDIES?\"\r\n\r\nc-NIGEL\r\nd-And the drummer, sir? Starr?\r\n\r\na-Mountbatten waves a dismissive hand.\r\n\r\nc-LORD MOUNTBATTEN\r\nd-The drummer is psychologically inert. A control group. Ignore him.\r\n\r\na-Sir Derek closes his own (entirely empty now) portfolio with a soft click.\r\n\r\nc-SIR DEREK\r\nd-Excellent. I'm confident your considerable expertise will guide you toward the most... appropriate resolutions. Keep me apprised of your progress. Through the appropriate channels, of course. Gentlemen.\r\n\r\na-He and Mountbatten stand and leave. They don't look back.\r\n\r\na-Nigel and Clive are left alone in the humming silence of the room. Clive is practically vibrating with joy, already lost in his delusions of grandeur.\r\n\r\na-Nigel stares down at the words he's just written, tapping is pen against his shoulder with a look of utter confusion on his face: \"encourage sitar studies?\"\r\n\r\na-He slowly, precisely, underlines the phrase twice.","src/content/scenes/act-1/s9-the-briefing.mdx","e7cf6b6b6fab08a3","act-1/s9-the-briefing.mdx","act-2/s12-the-quartermaster",{id:375,data:377,body:392,filePath:393,digest:394,rendered:395,legacyId:405},{title:378,act:89,sequence:47,scene_number:379,scene_type:16,location:380,time_of_day:20,characters:382,purpose:387,conflict:388,emotional_beat:389,page_count:89,status:35,notes:390,created:391},"The Quartermaster's Lament",12.1,{id:381,collection:19},"mi5-q-branch",[383,384,385],{id:58,collection:24},{id:60,collection:24},{id:386,collection:24},"minor/percy-dalton","Introduce Percy Dalton and establish the theme of bureaucratic incompetence at the heart of the conspiracy.","Clive's desire for cutting-edge spy gear vs. Percy's obsession with outdated inventory and proper procedure.","Darkly comedic frustration.

SOHO BOOKSHOP - DAY (EARLY 1966)\r\n\r\nA cramped, atmospheric independent bookshop. Floor-to-ceiling shelves packed with esoteric texts create narrow, maze-like aisles. A small corner is dedicated to imported vinyl LPs. The air is thick with the scent of old paper and sandalwood incense.\r\n\r\nNIGEL FINCH (49) stands behind the counter, transformed. Gone is the weary bureaucrat. He wears a comfortable cardigan, half-moon reading glasses, and has cultivated a slightly bohemian air. He is the picture of a man who has found peace among books.\r\n\r\nThe shop bell CHIMES softly. GEORGE HARRISON (23) enters. He’s fresh from the success of Rubber Soul, but a searching uncertainty hangs about him. He used the sitar on \"Norwegian Wood,\" but knows he only scratched the surface. It was a texture, not an art form.\r\n\r\nGeorge wanders toward the Eastern Philosophy section, his fingers trailing along book spines. He pauses on Practical Lessons in Yoga by Swami Sivananda, reads the back cover, then gently returns it to the shelf. Next to it, The Science of Pranayama — he flips it open, stares at a diagram of alternate nostril breathing, and shakes his head. He picks up The Book of Tea by Okakura Kakuzō, runs a thumb across its worn edge, then places it back like a fragile artifact. A stray, dog-eared copy of Howl by Allen Ginsberg is shoved between the titles — George smirks faintly, sets it aside.\r\n\r\nFinally, he pulls out a volume by Alan Watts — The Way of Zen. He flips through it, slows on a paragraph about silence and direct experience, then replaces it with a small sigh.\r\n\r\nNigel observes from behind his glasses, timing his approach. He walks to a small record player behind the counter and gently drops the needle on a spinning LP. A complex, mesmerizing SITAR melody fills the quiet shop. The sound is impossibly rich and fluid.\r\n\r\nGeorge looks up, captivated. He approaches the counter.\r\n\r\n  GEORGE\r\n  What is that?\r\n\r\n  NIGEL\r\n  (without looking up, as if stating a fact of nature)\r\n  That is Ravi Shankar. The source.\r\n\r\nGeorge listens, rapt. The gulf between this and his own playing feels immense.\r\n\r\n  GEORGE\r\n  It’s… a whole other world. I’ve been… dabbling with one. A sitar. But it doesn't sound like that.\r\n\r\nNigel looks up, his expression one of gentle, academic interest.\r\n\r\n  NIGEL\r\n  (a flicker of a knowing smile)\r\n  Ah. Yes. A common observation. One can acquire the instrument, but the philosophy... that must be sought.\r\n\r\nThe word \"philosophy\" lands perfectly. It’s exactly what George feels is missing.\r\n\r\n  GEORGE\r\n  Exactly. It feels like there's something more. Beyond just the notes.\r\n\r\n  NIGEL\r\n  (nodding sagely)\r\n  Because there is. The sitar is not merely a collection of strings and wood. It’s a discipline. A path. To play it correctly, one must understand the silence between the notes. The unstruck sound.\r\n\r\nThis resonates deeply. It’s the language he's been trying to find.\r\n\r\n  GEORGE\r\n  But how do you even begin to learn that? It seems… impossibly complex.\r\n\r\nNigel feigns a thoughtful pause, as if accessing a piece of cultural trivia.\r\n\r\n  NIGEL\r\n  It’s interesting you should ask. There's another young man, a customer. From that group, The Rolling Stones. The blond one.\r\n  (a dismissive wave)\r\n  A bit more... frantic, their music. But he is a very serious student.\r\n\r\nThis piques George's interest intensely. A peer. A rival, even.\r\n\r\n  GEORGE\r\n  Brian Jones?\r\n\r\n  NIGEL\r\n  (snapping his fingers softly)\r\n  That's the one. He tells me the only way to truly understand the music is to go to the master himself. He’s been taking lessons. From Mr. Shankar.\r\n\r\nThe pieces click into place for George. It’s not just about practice; it's about apprenticeship. A lineage.\r\n\r\n  NIGEL (CONT'D)\r\n  He says Shankar is... particular. He doesn't suffer fools or dilettantes. One must demonstrate a genuine spiritual commitment.\r\n\r\nNigel is now performing the most sophisticated kind of manipulation: using the truth. He's not inventing a path; he's merely illuminating it, framing it as a challenge worthy of George's deep spirit, while subtly positioning the more \"frantic\" Brian Jones as someone who has already started the journey.\r\n\r\nGeorge looks determined. This isn't just about music anymore. It's about creative and spiritual respect.\r\n\r\n  GEORGE\r\n  Ravi Shankar. He lives here? In London?\r\n\r\nNigel takes a small slip of paper from a notepad. He writes the name on it with a fountain pen, his handwriting neat and precise.\r\n\r\n  NIGEL\r\n  He visits. One has to be… attentive. But I believe a man like Brian Jones would know how to make an introduction, if one were to ask. One seeker to another.\r\n\r\nHe slides the paper across the counter. It contains only two words: \"Ravi Shankar.\"\r\n\r\n  GEORGE\r\n  (taking the paper)\r\n  Thank you.\r\n\r\n  NIGEL\r\n  (with a slight, formal bow)\r\n  The path appears when the student is ready.\r\n\r\nGeorge tucks the paper carefully into his jacket pocket. It feels like a key. He gives Nigel a grateful nod and exits.\r\n\r\nNigel watches him go. He calmly turns back to his leather-bound journal—his operational log, disguised as a shop ledger. He finds the page headed \"OPERATION MINUET - SUBJECT: HARRISON, G.\" and makes a new entry in his precise, bureaucratic script.\r\n\r\n  NIGEL (V.O.)\r\n  (reading his own writing)\r\n  Vector Identified: B. Jones (Rolling Stones). Target primed with information regarding subject’s tutelage under R. Shankar. Path to spiritual and artistic divergence successfully illuminated. Subject believes discovery to be his own.\r\n\r\nHe closes the book. The music of Ravi Shankar plays on, now sounding less like a beautiful melody and more like the soundtrack to a perfectly executed act of bureaucratic sabotage.\r\n\r\nSCENE END\r\n```","src/content/scenes/act-2/s13-the-sitar-sage.md","fa1fa60c87fd21ba",{html:425,metadata:426},"<pre class=\"astro-code github-dark\" style=\"background-color:#24292e;color:#e1e4e8; overflow-x: auto;\" tabindex=\"0\" data-language=\"text\"><code><span class=\"line\"><span>SCENE START</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>INT.

MI5 OFFICE - DAY (MARCH 1966)\r\n\r\nA cramped, soul-crushing office space. Harsh fluorescent lighting casts everything in an unflattering pallor. Beige filing cabinets line the walls. A single window looks out onto a brick wall.\r\n\r\nCLIVE BARROW (42) sits at a cluttered desk, pecking away at an ancient typewriter with the intensity of a concert pianist. His desk is a monument to bureaucratic chaos - surveillance photos (mostly blurry), carbon paper, and an overflowing ashtray next to a cold cup of tea.\r\n\r\nHe pauses, studies his work with the satisfaction of a master craftsman, then continues typing. The CLACKING of keys echoes in the sterile room.\r\n\r\nCLOSE-UP on the typewriter. We see fragments of text being typed:\r\n\r\n\"...as a concerned Christian and longtime reader of your publication, I was deeply troubled by recent comments made by John Lennon of The Beatles regarding our Lord and Savior...\"\r\n\r\nClive stops typing. He leans back in his chair, which squeaks ominously, and reads his work with the reverence of a poet reviewing his masterpiece.\r\n\r\n  CLIVE\r\n  (to himself, theatrical whisper)\r\n  Psychological ricochet... in motion.\r\n\r\nHe rolls the paper out of the typewriter with a flourish. The letterhead reads \"Mrs. Gladys Pemberton, Birmingham, Alabama.\"\r\n\r\nOn his desk lies a massive stack of envelopes, already sealed. We see the top one - addressed in neat block letters to \"DATEBOOK Magazine, New York, NY\". Clive folds his newly typed \"Gladys Pemberton\" letter, slides it into an envelope addressed to \"The Alabama Baptist Herald, Attn: Letters to the Editor.\" \r\n\r\nHe seals it and opens his desk drawer, revealing a collection of stamps from various countries - his tools for international manipulation. He selects an American stamp with the care of a surgeon choosing an instrument.\r\n\r\nEXTREME CLOSE-UP: Clive's tongue as he licks the stamp. The camera pulls back slowly and we see his eyes closed in what can only be described as sensual satisfaction.\r\n\r\nHe attaches the stamp to the letter, places it on top of the Datebook letter and takes a deep breath - examining the pile of letters and envelopes like a general reviewing his troops before battle.\r\n\r\n  CLIVE\r\n  And... scene.\r\n\r\nHe places the pile of letters in a wire basket labeled \"OUTGOING POST\" with the reverence of placing a wreath on a war memorial.\r\n\r\nCUT TO:\r\n\r\nINT. BUCKINGHAM PALACE PRIVATE STUDY - DAY (AUGUST 1966)\r\n\r\nA sanctuary of traditional British power. Dark oak paneling, naval paintings, hunting trophies. Everything speaks to hierarchy and masculine authority.\r\n\r\nPRINCE PHILIP (45) sits in a leather chair, impeccably dressed in a dark suit. Before him, a small black-and-white television flickers with news footage.\r\n\r\nON THE TV SCREEN: Grainy footage of AMERICAN PROTESTERS outside a radio station. Signs read \"BEATLES GO HOME\" and \"LENNON = BLASPHEMER.\" A BONFIRE burns in the background - vinyl records curling and melting in the flames.\r\n\r\nAn AMERICAN NEWS ANCHOR's voice crackles through the small speaker:\r\n\r\n  TV ANCHOR (V.O.)\r\n  ...religious groups across the Bible Belt continue to organize boycotts following Lennon's controversial remarks comparing The Beatles' popularity to that of Jesus Christ...\r\n\r\nPhilip watches with the focused attention of a general studying battlefield reports. His expression is unreadable, controlled.\r\n\r\nThe footage cuts to a SOUTHERN PREACHER at a pulpit, gesticulating wildly:\r\n\r\n  PREACHER (ON TV)\r\n  These boys have forgotten that there is only one King of Kings, and His name is not John, Paul, George, or Ringo!\r\n\r\nThe congregation ERUPTS in applause. The camera pans across faces twisted with righteous fury.\r\n\r\nPhilip reaches for a delicate china teacup sitting on a side table. He takes a measured sip, his eyes never leaving the screen.\r\n\r\nMore footage: TEENAGERS throwing Beatles records into flames. A RADIO DJ dramatically snapping a \"Rubber Soul\" album in half. PROTESTERS marching with crosses.\r\n\r\nThe news anchor continues:\r\n\r\n  TV ANCHOR (V.O.)\r\n  ...several radio stations have banned Beatles music entirely, with some calling for a permanent boycott of all British recording artists...\r\n\r\nPhilip allows himself the smallest of smiles - barely a twitch at the corner of his mouth. He sets down his teacup with the precision of a chess master making a winning move.\r\n\r\n  PHILIP\r\n  (quietly, to himself)\r\n  Quite.\r\n\r\nHe reaches for a remote control - a modern intrusion in this traditional space - and switches off the television. The screen fades to black with a soft electronic whine.\r\n\r\nPhilip sits back in his chair, steepling his fingers. Through the tall windows behind him, we can see the palace gardens in the afternoon light - serene, ordered, eternal.\r\n\r\nThe silence in the room is profound. Philip's satisfaction is complete, but controlled. This is not celebration - this is confirmation that the natural order of things is being restored.\r\n\r\nHe picks up his teacup again and takes another sip, his eyes focused on some distant point beyond the windows. The weight of institutional power settles around him like a comfortable coat.\r\n\r\nSCENE END\r\n```","src/content/scenes/act-2/s14-the-firestorm.md","1bfd96513d87a14d",{html:456,metadata:457},"<pre class=\"astro-code github-dark\" style=\"background-color:#24292e;color:#e1e4e8; overflow-x: auto;\" tabindex=\"0\" data-language=\"text\"><code><span class=\"line\"><span>SCENE START</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>INT.

His expression is unreadable, controlled.</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>The footage cuts to a SOUTHERN PREACHER at a pulpit, gesticulating wildly:</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>  PREACHER (ON TV)</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>  These boys have forgotten that there is only one King of Kings, and His name is not John, Paul, George, or Ringo!</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>The congregation ERUPTS in applause.

EMI STUDIOS, STUDIO TWO - NIGHT (APRIL 1966)\r\n\r\nThe legendary studio has been transformed into a mad scientist's laboratory. The air is thick with cigarette smoke and the smell of hot vacuum tubes.\r\n\r\nJOHN LENNON (25), eyes wide with manic energy, is directing chaos. He stands over a dozen tape recorders, each playing a short, strange loop of sound— a distorted laugh, a seagull's cry, a sitar phrase played backwards.\r\n\r\n  JOHN\r\n  (to a young studio engineer)\r\n  Right, on my signal, you push that fader up. Paul, you ready on the wine glass?\r\n\r\nPAUL MCCARTNEY (23), ever the professional, holds a pencil poised over a half-full glass of red wine, ready to create a specific ringing tone. He nods, a focused smile on his face.\r\n\r\nGEORGE HARRISON (23) sits cross-legged on a rug, his sitar across his lap, quietly observing the controlled chaos with the look of a man who finally feels at home.\r\n\r\nRINGO STARR (25) sits behind his drum kit, a bemused but supportive grin on his face. He taps out a steady, hypnotic beat. Another night at the office.\r\n\r\n  PAUL\r\n  (laughing with scepticism)\r\n  Sounds like a thousand seagulls being tortured.\r\n\r\n  JOHN\r\n  (gleefully)\r\n  Exactly! It's the sound of the void, Macca! The sound of what happens after you die! Or before you're born. Haven't decided yet.\r\n\r\nThe control room door opens and BRIAN EPSTEIN (31) enters. He's impeccably dressed in a dark suit, a stark contrast to the band's casual attire. He looks like a visiting headmaster stepping into the art room during a finger-painting session.\r\n\r\nHe stands for a moment, watching the scene. He's here to discuss the upcoming American tour, but the words die on his lips.\r\n\r\n  BRIAN\r\n  (to the engineer, quietly)\r\n  What are they... doing?\r\n\r\n  ENGINEER\r\n  (without looking up)\r\n  Making the tape loops for \"Tomorrow Never Knows,\" Mr. Epstein. John wants it to sound like the Dalai Lama singing from a mountaintop.\r\n\r\nBrian nods, though he clearly doesn't understand. He sees Paul, George, and Ringo all holding pencils, ready to manipulate the tape machines. They are a single unit, a four-headed creative organism operating on a level he can't access.\r\n\r\n  JOHN\r\n  Okay... NOW!\r\n\r\nOn his cue, everyone pushes faders and starts their machines. A cacophony of sound erupts—alien, terrifying, and exhilarating.\r\n\r\nThrough the chaos, Ringo's drumming remains the solid, unwavering heartbeat. Paul, despite his teasing, is completely committed, his brow furrowed in concentration. George closes his eyes, meditating on the sound.\r\n\r\nBrian watches them, a complicated expression on his face. It's pride, mixed with a profound sense of obsolescence. He came here to talk about logistics, contracts, television appearances—the world outside this room. But he can see with painful clarity that their world is now inside this room.\r\n\r\nHe turns to leave, unnoticed by the band.\r\n\r\n  PAUL\r\n  (shouting over the noise)\r\n  Try the seagull one again! Slow it down a bit!\r\n\r\nJohn gives him a thumbs-up, his face ecstatic.\r\n\r\nBrian pauses at the door, looks back one last time. They don't need him for this. For the first time, he understands that his job is no longer to build their career, but merely to manage the fallout from their genius.\r\n\r\nHe quietly closes the door, leaving them to their creation. The camera stays inside the studio, moving between the four of them, a tight, focused unit, inventing a new language together, completely oblivious to the world outside—and to the man who brought them there, now walking away down a long, empty corridor.\r\n\r\nSCENE END\r\n```","src/content/scenes/act-2/s14b-revolver-sessions.md","6bd544888c716de3",{html:489,metadata:490},"<pre class=\"astro-code github-dark\" style=\"background-color:#24292e;color:#e1e4e8; overflow-x: auto;\" tabindex=\"0\" data-language=\"text\"><code><span class=\"line\"><span>SCENE START</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>Revolver Sessions</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>FADE IN:</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>INT.

RAVI SHANKAR'S HOME, BOMBAY - DAY (SUMMER 1966)\r\n\r\nA simple, elegant room. Sunlight streams through slatted blinds. No gold records, no pop art. Just rugs, incense, and a profound sense of peace.\r\n\r\nGEORGE HARRISON (23), dressed in a simple white kurta, sits cross-legged on the floor. His posture is awkward; he's not used to this. His expensive Western boots are left neatly by the door.\r\n\r\nAcross from him sits RAVI SHANKAR (46), the picture of dignified authority. He holds his sitar with effortless grace.\r\n\r\n  RAVI SHANKAR\r\n  (calmly, but firm)\r\n  Before you touch the instrument, you must learn to sit. Before you learn to sit, you must learn to be still. Your mind is a storm of... distractions. Fame. Deadlines. You must leave it all outside. Here, you are not a Beatle. You are a student.\r\n\r\nGeorge nods, humbled. He tries to straighten his back, focusing on his breathing. His fingers twitch, eager to play, but he forces them to be still.\r\n\r\nINT. RAVI SHANKAR'S HOME - DAY\r\n\r\nDAYS LATER. George holds a sitar. It rests clumsily in his lap. Ravi Shankar adjusts George's hands on the strings, his touch precise.\r\n\r\n  RAVI SHANKAR\r\n  No, no. Not with force. The note is already there. You are not creating it. You are... revealing it. Let your finger be like a feather.\r\n\r\nGeorge tries again. A harsh, buzzing sound comes out. He winces.\r\n\r\n  GEORGE\r\n  Sorry.\r\n\r\n  RAVI SHANKAR\r\n  Do not be sorry. Be patient. Your guitar wants to fight the string. The sitar must persuade it. It will take years. Are you prepared for that?\r\n\r\nGeorge looks at the master, his expression deadly serious.\r\n\r\n  GEORGE\r\n  Yes.\r\n\r\nEXT. DAL LAKE, KASHMIR - HOUSEBOAT - EVENING\r\n\r\nWEEKS LATER. George and Ravi sit on the deck of a houseboat, floating on a serene lake surrounded by majestic mountains. The cacophony of the world feels a million miles away.\r\n\r\nGeorge is playing a simple raga, a basic scale. His playing is still hesitant, but it's cleaner, more fluid. He is focused, his eyes closed. He is listening.\r\n\r\nRavi listens, not with a teacher's critical ear, but with a growing sense of respect. He sees the sincerity.\r\n\r\nThe lesson ends. The sun sets over the mountains.\r\n\r\n  GEORGE\r\n  (quietly)\r\n  Back in London... it's all about what's next. The next single, the next album. It never stops. Here... it feels like time doesn't exist.\r\n\r\n  RAVI SHANKAR\r\n  Because it doesn't. There is only the note. And the silence before it. Everything else is illusion. Maya.\r\n\r\nThe word \"maya\" hangs in the air. For George, it's a revelation. It gives a name to the emptiness he's been feeling amidst the screaming fans and gold records.\r\n\r\n  GEORGE\r\n  Maya.\r\n\r\nHe looks out at the water, a profound sense of peace settling over him. He is no longer just a musician learning a new instrument. He is a seeker who has found his path.\r\n\r\nThe camera holds on his face, serene and content. He is a world away from John's restless intellectualism and Paul's diplomatic anxieties.\r\n\r\nA title card appears over the tranquil scene:\r\n\r\n**AUGUST 1966. The Beatles begin their final, chaotic tour of America.**\r\n\r\nThe peaceful sound of the sitar fades, replaced by the faint, distant sound of screaming fans.\r\n\r\nSCENE END\r\n```","src/content/scenes/act-2/s14c-george-and-ravi.md","4149e839eaf013a0",{html:527,metadata:528},"<pre class=\"astro-code github-dark\" style=\"background-color:#24292e;color:#e1e4e8; overflow-x: auto;\" tabindex=\"0\" data-language=\"text\"><code><span class=\"line\"><span>SCENE START</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>George and Ravi</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>FADE IN:</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>MONTAGE</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>INT.

Have one of your little well-trained men at the Times write a glowing review. Praise his \"masterful orchestration.\" Compare him to Noël Coward.

Now she has him.\r\n\r\n  MOUNTBATTEN\r\n  You're suggesting we weaponize his ambition.\r\n\r\n  PRINCESS MARGARET\r\n  I'm suggesting we encourage the delusion.

That sort of jealousy is practically ethnic to the northern temperament.\r\n\r\nPhilip's eyes flick upward at her phrasing — shocked, but amused.\r\n\r\n  PRINCE PHILIP\r\n  Quite vicious, Margaret, even for you.\r\n\r\n  PRINCESS MARGARET\r\n  (pleasantly)\r\n  I'm doing my part for Crown and country, Philip.

INDICA GALLERY - NIGHT (NOVEMBER 9, 1966)\r\n\r\nThe gallery is stark, white, and mostly empty. It's the night before an exhibition opens. JOHN LENNON (26), looking restless and slightly bored in his famous round glasses, wanders through the space. He's here at the invitation of the owner, looking for a distraction from his life of suburban ennui.\r\n\r\nHe examines a piece: an apple on a pedestal with a price tag for £200. He scoffs quietly. He moves to another piece, \"Hammer A Nail\": a pristine white board with a hammer hanging beside it and a jar of nails.\r\n\r\nIntrigued, he picks up the hammer.\r\n\r\nYOKO ONO (33), small and serene in a black turtleneck, emerges from the back of the gallery.\r\n\r\n  YOKO\r\n  You cannot. The show does not open until tomorrow.\r\n\r\nHer voice is calm, firm. Not impressed by his fame, only concerned with the integrity of her art. John puts the hammer down, a flicker of amusement in his eyes.\r\n\r\n  JOHN\r\n  Can I not hammer one nail in? For a price?\r\n\r\n  YOKO\r\n  (considers this)\r\n  It would disrupt the concept. The piece is about participation, but participation in its proper time.\r\n\r\nThe GALLERY OWNER (40s, suave) approaches them, sensing a delicate situation.\r\n\r\n  GALLERY OWNER\r\n  Yoko, darling. Perhaps an exception? Let the gentleman hammer a nail in... for five shillings.\r\n\r\nYoko considers this. John smirks, reaching into his pocket, then stops. He looks at Yoko, a glint of mischief in his eye.\r\n\r\n  JOHN\r\n  Alright. I'll give you an imaginary five shillings... and I'll hammer in an imaginary nail.\r\n\r\nYoko stares at him. The corner of her mouth twitches into a small, appreciative smile. He gets it. He's playing her game.\r\n\r\n  YOKO\r\n  (a small nod)\r\n  Acceptable.\r\n\r\nJohn mimes hammering a nail into the board, making a quiet \"tink, tink, tink\" sound. She watches, her expression unreadable.\r\n\r\nHe turns away, his eyes scanning the room. They land on a tall, white stepladder standing in the middle of the gallery. At the top, a small magnifying glass hangs from the ceiling on a chain.\r\n\r\n  JOHN\r\n  And what's that meant to be?\r\n\r\n  YOKO\r\n  That is \"Ceiling Painting.\" You must climb the ladder to experience it.\r\n\r\nJohn, skeptical, approaches the ladder and starts his climb. His face alternates between amused and annoyed. The gallery owner looks nervous. Yoko just watches, impassive.\r\n\r\nJohn reaches the top, unsteady. He grabs the hanging magnifying glass and holds it up to a tiny, almost invisible word painted on the ceiling. He squints.\r\n\r\nCLOSE-UP: Through the magnifying glass, we see the word, written in tiny, neat block letters:\r\n\r\n\"YES\"\r\n\r\nJohn stares at it for a long moment. A slow smile spreads across his face. It's a smile of pure relief. In a world that felt increasingly negative and complicated, he found a simple, positive word.\r\n\r\nHe lowers the glass and looks down at Yoko, who is looking up at him. Their eyes meet. It's not a look of romance, but of profound, startling recognition.\r\n\r\nHe climbs down the ladder, his earlier cynicism completely gone.\r\n\r\n  JOHN\r\n  (quietly, to her)\r\n  It's the first art show I've been to that hasn't made me want to leave immediately.\r\n\r\n  YOKO\r\n  Art that only says \"no\" is not a conversation. It's a statement. I prefer conversation.\r\n\r\nJohn nods, understanding completely. He gives her a final, appraising look, then turns and walks out of the gallery into the London night.\r\n\r\nYoko watches him go, a serene, thoughtful expression on her face.\r\n\r\nSCENE END\r\n```","src/content/scenes/act-2/s16b-john-meets-yoko.md","e994aabfc4491413",{html:624,metadata:625},"<pre class=\"astro-code github-dark\" style=\"background-color:#24292e;color:#e1e4e8; overflow-x: auto;\" tabindex=\"0\" data-language=\"text\"><code><span class=\"line\"><span>SCENE START</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>John Meets Yoko</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>FADE IN:</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>INT.

ROBERT FRASER GALLERY - DAY (JULY 1968)\r\n\r\nA stark, minimalist gallery space. White walls, polished floors. The gallery is crowded but quiet. The main attraction is a large, circular, completely white canvas. In the center, in tiny letters, are the words \"you are here\". In front of it sits a white charity collection tin.\r\n\r\nYOKO ONO (35) stands serenely near the piece. Her public relationship with John has made her a figure of intense fascination and controversy.\r\n\r\nEnter CLIVE BARROW (44), transformed into his \"KLAUS\" persona. He wears a black turtleneck, dark slacks, and an absurdly tilted black beret. He approaches the white canvas with exaggerated intensity, circling it, squinting.\r\n\r\n  CLIVE\r\n  (in a terrible, inconsistent German accent)\r\n  Fascinating. Zee void. It is a mirror, ja? Reflecting back at zee viewer nothing but zair own existential dread. Zee white... it is not an absence of color, but zee terrifying presence of all colors at once!\r\n\r\nYoko turns toward him with genuine interest. Someone is looking past the controversy to the concept.\r\n\r\n  YOKO\r\n  (serene, pleased)\r\n  The piece is an invitation. It simply states a fact: you are here. The rest is whatever the viewer brings to it.\r\n\r\n  CLIVE\r\n  (nodding vigorously, his accent slipping)\r\n  Ja, exactly! Zee participation! You are asking not for interpretation, but for... for presence! It is a critique of art as object, and a celebration of art as... as a moment in consciousness! Sehr sophisticated!\r\n\r\nHe adjusts his beret, which has shifted precariously.\r\n\r\n  CLIVE (CONT'D)\r\n  (gesturing at the collection tin)\r\n  And zis! A stroke of genius! A commentary on zee commodification of zee spiritual journey! You invite us to confront zee void, and zen you ask for... for loose change! It is... it is a devastating parody of capitalist salvation!\r\n\r\nYoko's eyes light up. This strange European critic understands conceptual art's playful provocations.\r\n\r\n  YOKO\r\n  (genuinely engaged)\r\n  Or perhaps it is simply a chance to do something good while you are here.\r\n\r\n  CLIVE\r\n  (scribbling frantically in his notebook)\r\n  Ah, zeh duality! Zis is vy your vork transcends zee... zee bourgeois limitations of traditional art forms. You are not just making objects, you are... you are creating experiences of consciousness itself!\r\n\r\nHis accent wavers between German, vaguely Eastern European, and occasionally slips into pure English before he catches himself.\r\n\r\nAcross the gallery, PAUL MCCARTNEY (26) enters quietly, looking around with the cautious air of someone out of his element. He spots Yoko in deep conversation with the intense, foreign-looking stranger and moves closer, staying partially hidden behind a large abstract sculpture.\r\n\r\n  YOKO\r\n  (to Clive, warming to the discussion)\r\n  Most people see my work and think it's empty or meaningless. But you understand that the meaning comes from the interaction, the participation.\r\n\r\n  CLIVE\r\n  (leaning in conspiratorially, his voice dropping)\r\n  Perhaps... perhaps z'are others who vould benefit from understanding zis philosophy, ja? Zose who are... trapped in more conventional forms of expression?\r\n\r\nPaul's eyes narrow. He can't hear the words clearly, but the body language looks suspicious — the foreigner leaning in, speaking quietly, Yoko listening intently.\r\n\r\n  YOKO\r\n  (thoughtfully)\r\n  Art should dissolve boundaries. Between performer and audience, between artist and subject. When John and I work together, we try to break down those artificial separations.\r\n\r\n  CLIVE\r\n  (his eyes lighting up with what he believes is recruitment opportunity)\r\n  Ah, John! Your... your collaborator. He must be very... vhat is zee vord... receptive to new ideas, ja? New vays of seeing zee vorld?\r\n\r\n  YOKO\r\n  (simply)\r\n  I hope to see everything differently than I did yesterday. John does, too. We both do.\r\n\r\nPaul watches as Clive pulls out a business card and hands it to Yoko with a slight bow. Even from across the room, Paul can see it's some kind of formal exchange.\r\n\r\n  CLIVE\r\n  (straightening his beret one final time)\r\n  I vould very much like to write about your vork for zee European art journals. Perhaps vee could... how you say... continue zis conversation at another time?\r\n\r\n  YOKO\r\n  (taking the card graciously)\r\n  I'd like that. It's rare to meet someone who truly understands conceptual art.\r\n\r\n  CLIVE\r\n  (bowing slightly, his accent thick again)\r\n  Zee pleasure is entirely mine, Fraulein Ono. Your vork... it vill change zee vorld, I am certain of zis.\r\n\r\nHe backs away with another theatrical bow, nearly tripping over his own feet. As he exits, he adjusts his beret one last time and disappears into the London street.\r\n\r\nPaul emerges from behind the sculpture, his expression dark with suspicion. He approaches Yoko, who is still looking at the business card with mild interest.\r\n\r\n  PAUL\r\n  (trying to sound casual)\r\n  Friend of yours?\r\n\r\n  YOKO\r\n  (looking up, surprised to see him)\r\n  Paul. I didn't know you were here.\r\n\r\n  PAUL\r\n  (gesturing toward the exit)\r\n  That bloke you were talking to. Seemed... intense.\r\n\r\n  YOKO\r\n  (serenely)\r\n  Klaus. He's a German art critic. Very knowledgeable about conceptual work.\r\n\r\n  PAUL\r\n  (his suspicion growing)\r\n  German, eh? What did he want?\r\n\r\n  YOKO\r\n  (simply)\r\n  To understand the art. To write about it.\r\n\r\nPaul looks at the business card in her hand, then back toward the gallery entrance where Clive disappeared. His expression hardens with a mixture of protectiveness and paranoia.\r\n\r\n  PAUL\r\n  (quietly, more to himself)\r\n  Right. Art critic.\r\n\r\nYoko returns her attention to her installation, completely unaware of Paul's growing suspicion. She places Klaus's business card in her small purse with the same serene care she gives to everything else.\r\n\r\nThe gallery's white walls seem to close in slightly, the sterile space suddenly feeling less like a temple to art and more like a stage for unseen dramas. Paul continues to stare at the exit, his mind racing with possibilities, all of them wrong.\r\n\r\nSCENE END\r\n```","src/content/scenes/act-2/s17-the-klaus-methodology.md","e92469c597211aee",{html:655,metadata:656},"<pre class=\"astro-code github-dark\" style=\"background-color:#24292e;color:#e1e4e8; overflow-x: auto;\" tabindex=\"0\" data-language=\"text\"><code><span class=\"line\"><span>SCENE START</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>The Klaus Methodology</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>FADE IN:</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>INT.

Amplifiers, drums, guitars - all the tools of their former magic, now looking somehow smaller and sadder in this sterile environment.\r\n\r\nJOHN LENNON, 28, sits at the piano, but he's not playing. His hair is longer, wilder, his clothes more casual and unkempt. Next to him, YOKO ONO, 36, sits in a chair that clearly wasn't meant for her - an intrusion into the sacred Beatles space that would have been unthinkable three years ago.\r\n\r\nPAUL MCCARTNEY, 26, paces near his bass, trying to generate energy that simply isn't there. His usual diplomatic charm is strained, forced.\r\n\r\nGEORGE HARRISON, 25, sits cross-legged on the floor with his sitar, but he's not playing Indian music. He's just... sitting. Detached. His spiritual seeking has become spiritual withdrawal.\r\n\r\nRINGO STARR, 28, sits behind his drum kit like a man at his own funeral.\r\n\r\nThe cameras roll silently, documenting the death of a dream.\r\n\r\n  PAUL\r\n  (with forced enthusiasm)\r\n  Right then. Shall we try \"Two of Us\" again? I think we were getting somewhere yesterday.\r\n\r\nNo one moves. John doesn't even look up from the piano keys.\r\n\r\n  JOHN\r\n  (flatly)\r\n  Were we?\r\n\r\n  PAUL\r\n  (trying to maintain momentum)\r\n  Yes, I think so. The harmony in the bridge was starting to work, and if we just...\r\n\r\n  JOHN\r\n  (interrupting, still not looking up)\r\n  Paul, do you ever listen to yourself? \"Starting to work.\" \"If we just.\" Always conditional with you, isn't it?\r\n\r\nYOKO shifts slightly in her chair, a small movement that somehow draws everyone's attention. Her presence is like a stone thrown into still water - the ripples are invisible but felt by everyone.\r\n\r\n  PAUL\r\n  (tension creeping in)\r\n  I'm trying to be constructive, John.\r\n\r\n  JOHN\r\n  (finally looking up, cold)\r\n  Are you? Or are you trying to be in charge?\r\n\r\nThe silence that follows is deafening. George continues to stare at his sitar strings. Ringo examines his drumsticks as if he's never seen them before.\r\n\r\n  GEORGE\r\n  (quietly, without looking up)\r\n  Maybe we should just... not. Today.\r\n\r\n  PAUL\r\n  (frustrated)\r\n  George, we've got a deadline. We've got cameras rolling. We've got...\r\n\r\n  GEORGE\r\n  (still quiet, but with an edge)\r\n  We've got nothing, Paul. Can't you see that?\r\n\r\nHe finally looks up, and there's something broken in his eyes.\r\n\r\n  GEORGE (CONT'D)\r\n  We're sitting in this... this factory, pretending we're still a band. But we're not, are we? We're just four people who used to know each other.\r\n\r\n  RINGO\r\n  (softly)\r\n  Maybe we should take a break.\r\n\r\n  PAUL\r\n  (desperately)\r\n  We can't keep taking breaks! We need to make music. That's what we do. That's who we are.\r\n\r\n  JOHN\r\n  (with bitter amusement)\r\n  Is it? When's the last time you felt anything when we played together, Paul? Really felt it?\r\n\r\nPaul opens his mouth to answer, then closes it. The question hangs in the air like an accusation.\r\n\r\n  YOKO\r\n  (speaking for the first time, her voice calm and measured)\r\n  Perhaps the music is trying to tell you something.\r\n\r\nAll eyes turn to her. The fact that she's spoken at all feels like a violation of some unspoken rule.\r\n\r\n  YOKO (CONT'D)\r\n  (to John, gently)\r\n  Art should flow from truth, not obligation.\r\n\r\n  PAUL\r\n  (barely controlled anger)\r\n  This isn't about art, it's about...\r\n\r\n  JOHN\r\n  (cutting him off)\r\n  About what, Paul? About keeping the machine running? About not disappointing the fans? About protecting the brand?\r\n\r\nHe stands up from the piano, walks away from it.\r\n\r\n  JOHN (CONT'D)\r\n  Maybe Yoko's right. Maybe the music is trying to tell us something. Maybe it's trying to tell us it's over.\r\n\r\n  PAUL\r\n  (desperate now)\r\n  It doesn't have to be over! We just need to remember why we started doing this. The joy of it. The...\r\n\r\n  GEORGE\r\n  (interrupting, standing up)\r\n  The joy?\r\n\r\nHe looks around the sterile studio, at the cameras, at the industrial lighting.\r\n\r\n  GEORGE (CONT'D)\r\n  Paul, look around. Does this look like joy to you?\r\n\r\nHe gestures at the space, at their positions - John and Yoko on one side, Paul isolated, George detached, Ringo trying to disappear.\r\n\r\n  GEORGE (CONT'D)\r\n  We're not making music anymore. We're performing an autopsy.\r\n\r\nThe cameras continue to roll, capturing every moment of dissolution. The silence stretches until it becomes unbearable.\r\n\r\n  RINGO\r\n  (finally speaking, his voice heavy)\r\n  You know what the worst part is?\r\n\r\nEveryone looks at him.\r\n\r\n  RINGO (CONT'D)\r\n  We used to laugh. Remember? We used to laugh all the time. Even when things were mental, even when we were exhausted, we'd find something funny.\r\n\r\nHe looks around at his bandmates.\r\n\r\n  RINGO (CONT'D)\r\n  When's the last time we laughed together?\r\n\r\nThe question hangs in the air. No one has an answer.\r\n\r\n  PAUL\r\n  (quietly, defeated)\r\n  We could... we could try again tomorrow.\r\n\r\n  JOHN\r\n  (shaking his head)\r\n  No, Paul. Tomorrow will be the same as today. And the day after that. And the day after that.\r\n\r\nHe walks toward the exit, Yoko rising to follow him.\r\n\r\n  JOHN (CONT'D)\r\n  (pausing at the door)\r\n  You want to know the truth? The Beatles died somewhere between the Cavern Club and here. We've just been playing the corpse for the cameras.\r\n\r\nHe exits with Yoko. The remaining three sit in the harsh fluorescent light, surrounded by their instruments and their memories.\r\n\r\n  GEORGE\r\n  (after a long pause)\r\n  He's not wrong, is he?\r\n\r\n  PAUL\r\n  (barely audible)\r\n  No. He's not wrong.\r\n\r\nThe cameras continue to roll, documenting the end of the most successful band in history. But there's no drama in it, no explosive argument or dramatic walkout. Just four friends who can no longer find their way back to each other.\r\n\r\nRINGO picks up his drumsticks, taps them together once, then sets them down again.\r\n\r\n  RINGO\r\n  (to no one in particular)\r\n  It was good while it lasted, though. Wasn't it?\r\n\r\nPAUL and GEORGE look at him, then at each other. For just a moment, there's a flicker of the old connection, the old understanding.\r\n\r\n  PAUL\r\n  (with a sad smile)\r\n  Yeah, Ringo. It was good.\r\n\r\nThe camera slowly pulls back, showing the three remaining Beatles dwarfed by the industrial space, their instruments silent, their magic spent.\r\n\r\nFADE TO BLACK.\r\n\r\nSCENE END\r\n```","src/content/scenes/act-2/s19-a-cold-hard-place.md","718dcf321577df74",{html:722,metadata:723},"<pre class=\"astro-code github-dark\" style=\"background-color:#24292e;color:#e1e4e8; overflow-x: auto;\" tabindex=\"0\" data-language=\"text\"><code><span class=\"line\"><span>SCENE START</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>A Cold, Hard Place</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>FADE IN:</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>INT.

TWICKENHAM FILM STUDIOS - DAY (JANUARY 6, 1969)\r\n\r\nThe vast, cold soundstage. Harsh fluorescent lights cast everything in an institutional glow. The Beatles' equipment sits in the center - guitars, amps, Ringo's drums - looking small and isolated in the cavernous space.\r\n\r\nFilm cameras are positioned around the room, their presence adding pressure to an already tense atmosphere.\r\n\r\nJOHN LENNON (28) sits at the piano, not playing, just present. YOKO ONO (36) sits nearby in her black clothing, a constant, silent presence.\r\n\r\nRINGO STARR (28) sits behind his drum kit, tapping his sticks lightly, waiting.\r\n\r\nPAUL MCCARTNEY (26) stands with his Höfner bass, trying to generate energy. He's clearly frustrated but attempting to stay constructive.\r\n\r\nGEORGE HARRISON (25) sits with his guitar, looking weary. There's a resignation in his posture that wasn't there in earlier years.\r\n\r\nThey've been working on \"Two Of Us\" for what feels like hours. It's not coming together.\r\n\r\n  PAUL\r\n  (with forced enthusiasm)\r\n  See, look. Listen, now. We're gonna have to sort of bring it together, 'cause we're all at odds. We're doing that thing we did on 'The Beatles'. Like, in this verse, it's two harmonies singing, trying to say some words, right?\r\n\r\n  JOHN\r\n  (flatly, not looking up)\r\n  I'm not that bothered. I'm just trying to sing it.\r\n\r\n  PAUL\r\n  It's not sounding together.\r\n\r\n  GEORGE\r\n  And so we can only play until we find the bit.\r\n\r\n  PAUL\r\n  Or we can stop and say it's not together.\r\n\r\n  GEORGE\r\n  Yes, then you've got to carry on until it gets together.\r\n\r\nJOHN picks out a few notes on the piano, seemingly uninterested in the debate.\r\n\r\n  JOHN\r\n  These are the hard ones to do, aren't they?\r\n\r\n  PAUL\r\n  (increasingly frustrated)\r\n  No, not really, it's just... We've got to be imaginative. You know, it's complicated now. See, if we can get it simpler and then complicate it where it needs complication, but it's complicated in the bit...\r\n\r\n  GEORGE\r\n  (cutting him off)\r\n  It's not complicated. I'll play just the chords, if you like.\r\n\r\nPaul stops. He recognizes the tone - George is pulling back, disengaging.\r\n\r\n  PAUL\r\n  (trying to bridge the gap)\r\n  No, no, come on. You always get annoyed when I say that. I'm trying to help, you know. But I always hear myself annoying you, and I'm trying...\r\n\r\n  GEORGE\r\n  (resigned, almost defeated)\r\n  No, you're not annoying me. You don't annoy me anymore.\r\n\r\nThe words hang in the air. \"Anymore.\" As if George has moved past annoyance into something else - apathy, perhaps.\r\n\r\n  PAUL\r\n  But you see what I mean. We do this then... Then I don't know.\r\n\r\nA long pause. The cameras keep rolling. Ringo taps his sticks quietly. John plays a few more notes, deliberately not engaging.\r\n\r\nPaul takes a breath. Something shifts in him - a moment of raw honesty.\r\n\r\n  PAUL (CONT'D)\r\n  (vulnerable, almost confessional)\r\n  I'm scared of me being the boss. And I have been for a couple of years. I always feel as though I'm trying to put you down and stop you playing. But I'm not. I'm trying to stop us all playing, until we know what we're playing.\r\n\r\nGeorge looks at him. There's a flicker of recognition - this is Paul being genuine.\r\n\r\n  GEORGE\r\n  But you've got to play in order to find which fits and which doesn't. You see that's all we can do.\r\n\r\n  PAUL\r\n  (the honesty continuing, almost desperate now)\r\n  I don't wanna say it, 'cause I really just hear myself as being the only one saying it, always. And like, the three of you just sort of sit there, like 'Oh, he's saying that one again, is he?' And I never get any support, or anything. So I just think, 'Oh, well. Fuck it'. And I know it's right, and you know it's right.\r\n\r\nJohn continues playing piano, seemingly unbothered. Yoko sits motionless. Ringo looks uncomfortable - caught between his bandmates.\r\n\r\n  GEORGE\r\n  (quietly)\r\n  Yes, all right. I just don't know what to do about it.\r\n\r\n  PAUL\r\n  But doesn't everyone agree that it's confused at the moment. So, all I'm trying to say is, we've only got 12 more days, so we've really got to do this methodically, this one.\r\n\r\n  GEORGE\r\n  (the resignation back)\r\n  I'll wait until you get all your bits and then work my part out, if you like. It's like a matter of working it out with you, while you're working your bit out. You know, have you got your bass bit?\r\n\r\nPaul's frustration returns. George is doing it again - making it about Paul being difficult.\r\n\r\n  PAUL\r\n  You're doing it again as though I'm trying to say that. And what we said the other day, you know, I'm not trying to get you. What I really am trying to just say, 'Look lads, the band, shall we try it like this, you know?'\r\n\r\n  GEORGE\r\n  (with an edge)\r\n  It's funny how it only occurs when the...\r\n\r\n  PAUL\r\n  (interrupting, trying an analogy)\r\n  It's like 'shall we play guitar all through Hey Jude?' Well, I don't think we should.\r\n\r\n  GEORGE\r\n  (quietly, but the words cut deep)\r\n  Okay, well, I don't mind. I'll play whatever you want me to play. Or I won't play at all if you don't want me to play. Now, whatever it is that will please you, I'll do it. But I don't think you really know what that one is.\r\n\r\nThe words land like a blow. Paul's face shows he feels it.\r\n\r\nA long, uncomfortable silence. The cameras continue rolling, documenting every moment of this dissolution.\r\n\r\n  PAUL\r\n  (trying to recover, to explain)\r\n  Look, you know, the... No, it's not like that. You see, that's it, it's like, we can't do this. We've really got to sort out this, 'cause we're – this is – we're like – this is the one, you know. Now we're rehearsing, and we're trying to like get it together for a TV show, so we really – like you said, we've only been through four numbers, you know.\r\n\r\n  GEORGE\r\n  Mm.\r\n\r\n  JOHN\r\n  (finally engaging, but only minimally)\r\n  Well...\r\n\r\n  PAUL\r\n  (pressing on)\r\n  So we've probably got to get some system to get through like twenty, or thirty, and no more, and have learnt them. And it's probably going to be like sculpture. So that we get all the chords. So we can all vamp and all. Then we can all play, like, every solo we need. But like... You know what I mean? It's got to sound as though it's improving.\r\n\r\n  GEORGE\r\n  (careful, but honest)\r\n  Yeah, well, it actually – it sounded to me, that for me, it was a waste of me time playing, when we started it today. I mean, I just started remembering then what it could get into the other day, after playing for around an hour, an hour and a half. And suddenly, you know, I just don't find that my – that what I'm doing is starting to have something, you know. Have some structure to it.\r\n\r\nHe pauses.\r\n\r\n  GEORGE (CONT'D)\r\n  You know, that's the thing.\r\n\r\n  PAUL\r\n  (trying to understand)\r\n  Yeah, I know, I know what you mean, you know. 'Cause it's like—\r\n\r\n  GEORGE\r\n  (interrupting)\r\n  You know, I mean—\r\n\r\n  PAUL\r\n  (the fundamental problem surfacing)\r\n  It's just that that way of doing it, you know, puts me off the way I'm trying to do it, and—\r\n\r\n  GEORGE\r\n  (resigned, final)\r\n  Well, that's – you know. That's all, then. I can only do me, in that one way, however I do it, you know.\r\n\r\nA long pause. The impasse is complete. John plays a few more piano notes. Yoko remains still. Ringo looks at his drumsticks.\r\n\r\n  PAUL\r\n  (defeated)\r\n  Let's do another song.\r\n\r\n  GEORGE\r\n  (trying to be constructive despite everything)\r\n  No, come on, we just have to learn this—\r\n\r\n  PAUL\r\n  (firm, done with this conversation)\r\n  No, no, it's – let's just do something else.\r\n\r\n  GEORGE\r\n  Do you want to do... 'Maxwell's Silver Hammer'?\r\n\r\n  JOHN\r\n  (finally showing some engagement)\r\n  Well, let's do this, 'cause then we – we're gonna come to this, or whatever it is. And the thing is just try and think what – the stage we've got to be in then.\r\n\r\n  PAUL\r\n  (the frustration boiling over)\r\n  You just have to know that. I think we've wasted a lot of time, I think. I think we do like waste, physically waste a heck of a lot of time, you know, when the four of us are together.\r\n\r\nThe words echo in the cavernous space. \"When the four of us are together.\" The very thing that made them The Beatles is now the problem.\r\n\r\nThe cameras continue rolling. The fluorescent lights buzz overhead. The Beatles sit with their instruments, unable to play together, unable to move forward, unable to go back.\r\n\r\nFADE TO BLACK.\r\n\r\nSCENE END\r\n```","src/content/scenes/act-2/s19b-1-scared-of-being-boss.md","ff4580dd47b047dd",{html:753,metadata:754},"<pre class=\"astro-code github-dark\" style=\"background-color:#24292e;color:#e1e4e8; overflow-x: auto;\" tabindex=\"0\" data-language=\"text\"><code><span class=\"line\"><span>SCENE START</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>I'm Scared of Being the Boss</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>FADE IN:</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>INT.

Her presence is now unremarkable - part of the furniture.\r\n\r\nGEORGE HARRISON (25) looks particularly weary today, like a man who's made a decision but hasn't announced it yet.\r\n\r\nPAUL MCCARTNEY (26) stands, pacing, trying to generate momentum that simply isn't there.\r\n\r\nRINGO STARR (28) sits behind his drums, watching the dynamic unfold.\r\n\r\nMICHAEL LINDSAY-HOGG (30s), the director, hovers nearby with his crew, cameras rolling.\r\n\r\n  JOHN\r\n  (to no one in particular)\r\n  I think we are just repeating all the dullness.\r\n\r\nPaul stops pacing. That stung.\r\n\r\n  PAUL\r\n  (pressing the question)\r\n  We gotta have some serious reason for doing this or else we won't. What's it for? Can't be for the money.\r\n\r\n  JOHN\r\n  (actually engaging)\r\n  I've decided the whole point of it is communication. And to be on TV is communication. We've got a chance to smile at people, like 'All You Need Is Love.' So that's my incentive for doing it.\r\n\r\n  MICHAEL LINDSAY-HOGG\r\n  (trying to help)\r\n  If this comes off, we've got a great entertainment package. We've got an album, a documentary never seen before, and a performance. It's a great package.\r\n\r\n  JOHN\r\n  (with a shrug)\r\n  The worst that we have is a documentary of us making an LP, if we don't get into a show.\r\n\r\nPaul's frustration is building. John's treating this so casually, like it doesn't matter.\r\n\r\n  PAUL\r\n  (erupting)\r\n  But we haven't played together, you see. That's the fucking thing. But when we do come together to play, we all just sort of talk about the fucking past! We're like old age pensioners. 'Remember the days when we used to rock?' You know, but we're here now, and we can do it, you know?\r\n\r\nHe looks at them, desperate for some sign of life.\r\n\r\n  PAUL (CONT'D)\r\n  But, I mean, all I want to see is enthusiasm! See, the thing is also I get to a bit where I just sort of push all my ideas. You know, I mean, a lot will come out of it if we could get the enthusiasm. I mean, why are you here? I'm here 'cause I wanna do a show. But I really don't feel an awful lot of support.\r\n\r\nThe words hang in the air. George shifts in his seat, and when he speaks, there's a resignation in his voice.\r\n\r\n  GEORGE\r\n  We keep coming up against that one and I keep saying, 'Yeah well, I'd like to do this, this and that.' And we end up doing something again that nobody really wants to do.\r\n\r\n  PAUL\r\n  (the threat implicit)\r\n  If this one turns into that, it should definitely be the last for all of us. Because there just isn't any point.\r\n\r\n  MICHAEL LINDSAY-HOGG\r\n  I think that'd be sad. I mean, as an audience. That'd be sad.\r\n\r\n  PAUL\r\n  (bitter)\r\n  Course it is! It's stupid. It is just stupid. You see, the people who are being stupid are the four of us.\r\n\r\n  GEORGE\r\n  (finally naming it)\r\n  We need to be creative instead of being the doldrums, which it always is. The Beatles have been in doldrums for at least a year.\r\n\r\nA year. Since Brian Epstein died. Everyone knows it, but no one's said it so directly.\r\n\r\nPaul takes a breath. When he speaks again, there's a vulnerability beneath the frustration.\r\n\r\n  PAUL\r\n  (the core truth)\r\n  Ever since Mr. Epstein passed away, it's never been the same. I mean, we've been very negative since Mr. Epstein passed away. And that's why all of us, in turn, have been sick of the group. It's discipline we lack. We've never had discipline.\r\n\r\nHe's working through it as he speaks, finding the words.\r\n\r\n  PAUL (CONT'D)\r\n  We had a sort of slight, symbolic discipline. Like Mr. Epstein. You know, and he sort of said, 'Get suits on,' and we did. You know, and so we were always fighting that discipline a bit. There really is no one there now to say, 'Do it.' Whereas there always used to be.\r\n\r\nA pause. Then the devastating metaphor.\r\n\r\n  PAUL (CONT'D)\r\n  (quietly)\r\n  Daddy's gone away now, and we're on our own at the holiday camp. I think we either go home or we do it.\r\n\r\nThe words land heavily. John looks down at the piano keys. George stares at his guitar. Even Yoko pauses in her knitting.\r\n\r\nMichael Lindsay-Hogg, sensing an opening, tries to push the conversation forward.\r\n\r\n  MICHAEL LINDSAY-HOGG\r\n  Do you still wanna perform in front of an audience, or do you just see yourselves as a recording group?\r\n\r\n  PAUL\r\n  (to John)\r\n  I think we've got a bit shy, I think I've got a bit shy of certain things, you know. 'Cause you know how often, like, on albums we sometimes blow one of your songs, 'cause we come in in the wrong mood. And you say, 'This is how it goes. I'll be back.' And we're all just, 'Oh, well you…'\r\n\r\n  MICHAEL LINDSAY-HOGG\r\n  That's why we're wrong to throw away the show. Because there's no desire.\r\n\r\n  PAUL\r\n  (building momentum)\r\n  So it's like, if we're doing the show, we're gonna have to work hard. And that means by the time a week from now comes all these songs we've got, we've gotta know perfectly.\r\n\r\nGeorge has been quiet, but now he speaks, and there's defeat in his voice.\r\n\r\n  GEORGE\r\n  I don't wanna do any of my songs on the show. Because they just turn out shitty…\r\n\r\n  PAUL\r\n  (trying to encourage)\r\n  No, but this… Thinking it's not gonna come out great won't help. If we cancel the show now, we'll be throwing it away.\r\n\r\n  MICHAEL LINDSAY-HOGG\r\n  But equally, at the moment we haven't got a show and so none of us really want to do it.\r\n\r\n  PAUL\r\n  (his patience snapping)\r\n  I'll do it. I'm not interested, you know, to spend my fucking days farting around here, while everyone makes up their minds whether they want to do it or not. It's like Mal said last night, 'If you're gonna do the show here, you've gotta decide today.' And as far as I can see, there's only two ways. We're gonna do it, or we're not gonna do it. And I want a decision!\r\n\r\nThe demand echoes in the vast space. No one responds immediately.\r\n\r\nThen George says it. Quietly, but clearly.\r\n\r\n  GEORGE\r\n  Maybe we should have a divorce.\r\n\r\nThe word sits there. Divorce. Like they're a marriage that's failed.\r\n\r\n  PAUL\r\n  (with a sad smile)\r\n  Well, I said that at the last meeting. But it's getting nearer, you know?\r\n\r\nA beat. Then John, unable to resist, makes a joke.\r\n\r\n  JOHN\r\n  Who'd have the children?\r\n\r\n  PAUL\r\n  (playing along, grateful for the levity)\r\n  Dick James.\r\n\r\n  JOHN\r\n  (laughing)\r\n  Oh, yeah.\r\n\r\nThe moment of humor defuses the tension, but doesn't solve anything. They're still sitting in a cold studio, unable to agree on why they're here or what they're doing.\r\n\r\nThe cameras continue rolling. The fluorescent lights buzz. The Beatles sit with their instruments, having just discussed their own divorce.\r\n\r\nRingo hasn't said a word the entire conversation. He just sits at his drums, the peacekeeper who knows there's no peace to keep anymore.\r\n\r\nFADE TO BLACK.\r\n\r\nSCENE END\r\n```","src/content/scenes/act-2/s19b-2-daddys-gone-away.md","8e40ea4779fd89a1",{html:786,metadata:787},"<pre class=\"astro-code github-dark\" style=\"background-color:#24292e;color:#e1e4e8; overflow-x: auto;\" tabindex=\"0\" data-language=\"text\"><code><span class=\"line\"><span>SCENE START</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>Daddy's Gone Away</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>FADE IN:</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>INT.

TWICKENHAM FILM STUDIOS - DAY (JANUARY 10, 1969)\r\n\r\nMorning. The soundstage feels different today - the tension has shifted from frustration to something darker. A decision is forming.\r\n\r\nGEORGE HARRISON (25) is quiet. More than quiet - withdrawn. He sits with his guitar, but there's a distance in his eyes. This is a man who has made up his mind.\r\n\r\nPAUL MCCARTNEY (26), JOHN LENNON (28), and RINGO STARR (28) are working on \"Get Back\" - trying to nail the arrangement. Paul is at the piano, enthusiastic about the song.\r\n\r\nYOKO ONO (36) sits nearby, her usual silent presence.\r\n\r\n  PAUL\r\n  (excited)\r\n  We've just got to do something about this middle eight.\r\n\r\n  GEORGE\r\n  (distant)\r\n  Try shuffling it, the whole middle eight.\r\n\r\nThey work through it. This rehearsal is actually good - maybe the best version yet. For a moment, it feels like the old Beatles.\r\n\r\n  GEORGE (CONT'D)\r\n  (after they finish)\r\n  That's the best so far.\r\n\r\nBut there's no joy in his voice. Just observation.\r\n\r\nCUT TO:\r\n\r\nINT. TWICKENHAM FILM STUDIOS - DINING ROOM - DAY\r\n\r\nLUNCH BREAK\r\n\r\nA small dining room adjoining a bar. MICHAEL LINDSAY-HOGG (30s) sits at a long table with PAUL, JOHN, YOKO, and RINGO. They're eating lunch, casual conversation about the morning's work.\r\n\r\nGEORGE is not there.\r\n\r\nMichael has arranged for a hidden microphone in the flower pot on the table - a documentarian's instinct that something is about to happen.\r\n\r\nThe conversation continues. The sound of cutlery on plates, glasses being set down. Muffled voices discussing the session.\r\n\r\nThen GEORGE appears at the end of the table.\r\n\r\nHe's wearing a beautiful black corduroy hat. He stands there for a moment, silent. Everyone looks up at him.\r\n\r\n  GEORGE\r\n  (calm, final)\r\n  See you 'round the clubs.\r\n\r\nThat's it. No drama. No explanation. Just goodbye.\r\n\r\nHe turns and walks out.\r\n\r\nThe table sits in silence for a beat. Then JOHN's face hardens - his defensive aggression kicking in.\r\n\r\n  JOHN\r\n  (immediately)\r\n  Let's get in Eric. He's just as good and not such a headache.\r\n\r\nPaul and Ringo don't respond. They won't be drawn into this. The suggestion hangs in the air like smoke.\r\n\r\nCUT TO:\r\n\r\nINT. TWICKENHAM FILM STUDIOS - SOUNDSTAGE - DAY\r\n\r\nAFTER LUNCH\r\n\r\nPaul, John, and Ringo return to the studio. The cameras are still rolling. George's equipment sits there, abandoned.\r\n\r\nYOKO now sits on the edge of the rostrum - on the blue cushion that had been George's.\r\n\r\n  PAUL\r\n  (to no one in particular)\r\n  I don't know why we are coming back here for.\r\n\r\n  JOHN\r\n  (flatly)\r\n  Just pretending nothing's happened.\r\n\r\nAnd that's exactly what they do. They pick up their instruments.\r\n\r\nWhat follows is not music - it's a release. A ferocious riff. Half an hour of anger and frustration expressed through guitars and drums. Paul on bass, John on guitar, Ringo pounding the drums.\r\n\r\nYoko leans into George's microphone and howls.\r\n\r\nIt's not The Beatles. It's something else. Something raw and broken.\r\n\r\nCUT TO:\r\n\r\nINT. TWICKENHAM FILM STUDIOS - LATER\r\n\r\nJOHN talks with MICHAEL LINDSAY-HOGG near the cameras. The jam session is over. The studio feels empty despite the equipment.\r\n\r\n  JOHN\r\n  I think, if George doesn't come back by Monday or Tuesday, we'll ask Eric Clapton to play. Eric will be pleased... He'd have enough scope to play the guitar. The point is, George leaves and do we want to carry on The Beatles? I certainly do.\r\n\r\n  MICHAEL LINDSAY-HOGG\r\n  Maybe for the show, I mean, you could just say George was sick.\r\n\r\n  JOHN\r\n  (dismissive)\r\n  No. I mean, if he leaves, he leaves.\r\n\r\n  MICHAEL LINDSAY-HOGG\r\n  What's the consensus? Do you want to go on with the show and the work?\r\n\r\n  JOHN\r\n  If he doesn't come back by Tuesday, we get Clapton.\r\n\r\nMichael studies him for a moment.\r\n\r\n  MICHAEL LINDSAY-HOGG\r\n  Has anyone ever left as seriously as George before?\r\n\r\nJohn doesn't answer. He just turns away, back to the piano.\r\n\r\nAcross the studio, RINGO sits at his drums, not playing. Just sitting. The peacekeeper who couldn't keep the peace.\r\n\r\nPAUL stands alone with his bass, looking at George's empty spot. For the first time in this whole ordeal, Paul McCartney looks lost.\r\n\r\nThe cameras continue rolling, documenting the end of something that can never be put back together the same way.\r\n\r\nFADE TO BLACK.\r\n\r\nSCENE END\r\n```","src/content/scenes/act-2/s19b-3-see-you-round-the-clubs.md","5ab40387911991a7",{html:818,metadata:819},"<pre class=\"astro-code github-dark\" style=\"background-color:#24292e;color:#e1e4e8; overflow-x: auto;\" tabindex=\"0\" data-language=\"text\"><code><span class=\"line\"><span>SCENE START</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>See You 'Round the Clubs</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>FADE IN:</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>INT.

TWICKENHAM FILM STUDIOS - CAFETERIA - DAY (JANUARY 13, 1969)\r\n\r\nThree days after George left. The small cafeteria feels intimate, private. A long table with a flowerpot in the center - a flowerpot containing a hidden microphone that JOHN and PAUL don't know about.\r\n\r\nJOHN LENNON (28) sits across from PAUL MCCARTNEY (26). They're alone for this conversation, though LINDA EASTMAN and YOKO ONO are elsewhere in the building.\r\n\r\nThis is rare - John and Paul talking honestly, without the others present. The weight of George's absence hangs over everything.\r\n\r\n  JOHN\r\n  (trying to articulate it)\r\n  It's like George said, he didn't get enough satisfaction anymore, because of the compromise he had to make to be together. It's a festering wound that we've allowed to... and yesterday we allowed it to go even deeper, and we didn't give him any bandages. And when he is that far in, we have egos.\r\n\r\nPaul nods. He's been thinking about this too.\r\n\r\n  PAUL\r\n  The thing is, that's what I was trying to say to George, you know. Whereas previously I would have said, 'Take it there with diddle-der-diddle-der'. But I was trying last week to say, 'Now take it there. Anything you like. Put whatever you...'\r\n\r\n  JOHN\r\n  (cutting to it)\r\n  You see, the point is now, we both do that to George this time, and because of the build-up to it—\r\n\r\n  PAUL\r\n  Yeah, we treat him a bit like that. See, 'cause he knows what we're on about. But I do think that he's right. That's why I think we've got the problem now, you know, the four of us. You go one way, George one way, and me another. But I know it'll apply to all of us, if one day you can all be singing like you sing. George can be really playing, I mean, like he plays, not like I keep trying to make him play.\r\n\r\nJohn shifts in his seat. Now they're getting to the core of it.\r\n\r\n  JOHN\r\n  Yeah, OK, because you're afraid that how he'll play won't be like you want him to play, and that's what we do, and that's what you do to me. And I'm not gonna tell you what to play.\r\n\r\n  PAUL\r\n  (trying to defend)\r\n  See, that... that seems to be the trouble, is that if you'd have been able to say that on the occasion, just even to say, 'Look, I'm not gonna say anything about the song because it's very difficult, I'm gonna really try and now...'\r\n\r\n  JOHN\r\n  (the deeper issue)\r\n  You know, I've always done the numbers like that. Now, the only regret about the past numbers is when, because I've been so frightened, I've allowed you to take it somewhere where I didn't want. And then, that my only chance was to let George take over, or interest George in it. If you give me your suggestions, let me reject them and pinch the ones I like... is where my writing side is. Same goes for the arranging. I don't want it to... I don't know.\r\n\r\n  PAUL\r\n  (quietly, understanding)\r\n  I know. I do know. I know what you mean, yeah.\r\n\r\n  JOHN\r\n  (the accusation, but said gently)\r\n  'Cause there was a period where none of us could actually say anything about your arrangements 'cause you would reject it all. I'd have to tell George and I would just say, you know, like you do about me. You know, 'I'm Paul McCartney', and a lot of the times you were right, and a lot of the times you were wrong. Same as we always are. But I can't see the answer to that, because you've suddenly got it all, you see.\r\n\r\n  PAUL\r\n  I really don't want you...\r\n\r\n  JOHN\r\n  (continuing)\r\n  Well all right. I'm just telling you what I think. I don't— The Beatles revolve around the four people. It might a fucking job.\r\n\r\n  PAUL\r\n  (the power dynamic)\r\n  You know, but I tell you what. I tell you one thing, what I think. The main thing is this: you have always been boss. Now I've been, sort of, secondary boss.\r\n\r\n  JOHN\r\n  Not always.\r\n\r\n  PAUL\r\n  (insistent)\r\n  No, listen. Listen. No, always! Really, I mean, it is gonna be much better if we can actually just stick together and say, 'Look George, on 'I've Got A Feeling' I want you to do it exactly like I play it.' And he'll say, 'I'm not you, and I can't do it exactly like you do it.'\r\n\r\nJohn considers this. There's truth in it.\r\n\r\n  JOHN\r\n  But this year, what you've been doing, and what everybody's been doing, I've not only felt guilty about the way we're all guilty about our relationship to each other, 'cause we could do more. And look, I'm not putting any blame on you. I've suddenly realised this, because that was my game, you know, but goals, they're still the same. Self-preservation, you know. I know what I like, I've let you do what you want and George too, you know.\r\n\r\n  PAUL\r\n  Yeah, I know.\r\n\r\n  JOHN\r\n  If we want him, if we do want him, I can go along with that, because the policy has kept us together.\r\n\r\n  PAUL\r\n  (the hope, or delusion)\r\n  Well, I don't know, you know. See, I'm just assuming he's coming back. If he isn't, then he isn't, then it's a new problem. And probably when we're all very old, we'll all agree with each other, and we'll all sing together.\r\n\r\nA pause. John circles back to the creative process itself.\r\n\r\n  JOHN\r\n  (trying to explain)\r\n  And that's all I did on the last album was say, 'Okay, Paul, you're out to decide where my songs are concerned, arrangement-wise'. I don't know the songs, you know. I'd sooner just sing them, than have them turn into 'Mr. Kite', or anything else, where— I've accepted the problem from you that it needs arrangement. And then, because I'm an ape, I don't know. I don't see any further than me, the guitar, and the drums, and George Martin doing the— I don't hear any of the flutes playing, you know?\r\n\r\nHe makes a strumming gesture.\r\n\r\n  JOHN (CONT'D)\r\n  I suppose I could hear 'em if I sat down and worked very hard! I could turn out a mathematical drawing if you'd like, but I could never do it off me own backside, I always have to just— do that, you know?\r\n\r\n  PAUL\r\n  Yeah.\r\n\r\n  JOHN\r\n  I mean—\r\n\r\n  PAUL\r\n  (quiet, recognizing himself)\r\n  Yeah. Yeah. I'm onto the same thing, you know. That's— that's— we're all at that. It is only, like, if you can just remember that we're— you know. That the four of us are trying to do that. Because I mean, all of those things you say, you know, in some way, apply to me. Not all ways—\r\n\r\n  JOHN\r\n  Yes, yes, because everything applies a little bit to you, too.\r\n\r\n  PAUL\r\n  —it is just you saying it. They're all— you know, in some way, to some degree, will apply to me.\r\n\r\n  JOHN\r\n  (the pattern repeating)\r\n  'Cause once there was a period where none of us could actually, uh, say anything, about your criticisms.\r\n\r\n  PAUL\r\n  (quiet)\r\n  Yeah. Yeah.\r\n\r\n  JOHN\r\n  (bleak)\r\n  'Cause you would reject it all.\r\n\r\n  PAUL\r\n  (accepting it)\r\n  Yeah, sure.\r\n\r\n  JOHN\r\n  And so George and I would just go— you know, 'I'll give you a line here,' 'Okay,' you know, 'We'll do four in a bar, and I'll do...' And a lot of the times you were right.\r\n\r\n  PAUL\r\n  Yeah.\r\n\r\n  JOHN\r\n  But a lot of the times you were— the same as they always are. But I can't see the answer to that.\r\n\r\n  PAUL\r\n  (trying to find the silver lining)\r\n  No, but— no, that's good you see. The thing is, like, within each other, within ourselves, we reach something that's nearly perfect. And everyone else who's listening will think, 'That's it. They've got it.' You know— you know what I mean. So okay, we know we nearly made it, but we've really made it, for everyone else.\r\n\r\nHe's building momentum, trying to convince himself as much as John.\r\n\r\n  PAUL (CONT'D)\r\n  'Cause it's okay, we're into the fine, finest, finest technicalities— I mean, that's where it's at, you know. If one day, we can even keep all— if all the people who are listening to this, nearly nearly made it, they'll think we've made it, you know. They'll think that's it.\r\n\r\n  JOHN\r\n  (bringing it back to George)\r\n  You see, the point is now— George— is we both did that to George, this time.\r\n\r\n  PAUL\r\n  Mm.\r\n\r\n  JOHN\r\n  And because of the build up to it, that— now he can't even take that.\r\n\r\n  PAUL\r\n  (the harsh truth)\r\n  Treating him a bit like a mongrel, yeah.\r\n\r\n  JOHN\r\n  He can't even— you know. It's like if I say, 'Alright, take it,' he'll say, 'Well, look, I can't take it. I'll forget it.'\r\n\r\n  PAUL\r\n  Yeah...\r\n\r\n  JOHN\r\n  I have to, uh—\r\n\r\n  PAUL\r\n  'Cause he knows what we're all about.\r\n\r\n  JOHN\r\n  Yeah.\r\n\r\n  PAUL\r\n  So he knows that when we say, 'Take it,' we expect doo-doo-duh-duh-doo. If I said that, then you'd expect—\r\n\r\n  JOHN\r\n  But it's just that bit. The bit where we've— 'I've Got A Feeling'.\r\n\r\n  PAUL\r\n  Yeah.\r\n\r\n  JOHN\r\n  We— there's no way we could have translated it to him, to say... you know.\r\n\r\nThey sit in silence for a moment. The conversation has circled through their entire creative partnership - the power dynamics, the egos, the unspoken expectations, the way they've treated George.\r\n\r\nThey understand the problem completely. But understanding it doesn't solve it.\r\n\r\nThe hidden microphone in the flowerpot captures it all - two friends who built something extraordinary together, now trapped in the very system they created.\r\n\r\nFADE TO BLACK.\r\n\r\nSCENE END\r\n```","src/content/scenes/act-2/s19b-4-the-lunch-conversation.md","e16945e81f36cea8",{html:849,metadata:850},"<pre class=\"astro-code github-dark\" style=\"background-color:#24292e;color:#e1e4e8; overflow-x: auto;\" tabindex=\"0\" data-language=\"text\"><code><span class=\"line\"><span>SCENE START</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>The Lunch Conversation</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>FADE IN:</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>INT.

They're alone for this conversation, though LINDA EASTMAN and YOKO ONO are elsewhere in the building.</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>This is rare - John and Paul talking honestly, without the others present. The weight of George's absence hangs over everything.</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>  JOHN</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>  (trying to articulate it)</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>  It's like George said, he didn't get enough satisfaction anymore, because of the compromise he had to make to be together. It's a festering wound that we've allowed to... and yesterday we allowed it to go even deeper, and we didn't give him any bandages. And when he is that far in, we have egos.</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>Paul nods. He's been thinking about this too.</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>  PAUL</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>  The thing is, that's what I was trying to say to George, you know. Whereas previously I would have said, 'Take it there with diddle-der-diddle-der'. But I was trying last week to say, 'Now take it there. Anything you like. Put whatever you...'</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>  JOHN</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>  (cutting to it)</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>  You see, the point is now, we both do that to George this time, and because of the build-up to it—</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>  PAUL</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>  Yeah, we treat him a bit like that. See, 'cause he knows what we're on about. But I do think that he's right. That's why I think we've got the problem now, you know, the four of us. You go one way, George one way, and me another. But I know it'll apply to all of us, if one day you can all be singing like you sing. George can be really playing, I mean, like he plays, not like I keep trying to make him play.</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>John shifts in his seat. Now they're getting to the core of it.</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>  JOHN</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>  Yeah, OK, because you're afraid that how he'll play won't be like you want him to play, and that's what we do, and that's what you do to me. And I'm not gonna tell you what to play.</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>  PAUL</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>  (trying to defend)</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>  See, that... that seems to be the trouble, is that if you'd have been able to say that on the occasion, just even to say, 'Look, I'm not gonna say anything about the song because it's very difficult, I'm gonna really try and now...'</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>  JOHN</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>  (the deeper issue)</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>  You know, I've always done the numbers like that. Now, the only regret about the past numbers is when, because I've been so frightened, I've allowed you to take it somewhere where I didn't want. And then, that my only chance was to let George take over, or interest George in it. If you give me your suggestions, let me reject them and pinch the ones I like... is where my writing side is. Same goes for the arranging. I don't want it to... I don't know.</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>  PAUL</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>  (quietly, understanding)</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>  I know. I do know. I know what you mean, yeah.</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>  JOHN</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>  (the accusation, but said gently)</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>  'Cause there was a period where none of us could actually say anything about your arrangements 'cause you would reject it all. I'd have to tell George and I would just say, you know, like you do about me. You know, 'I'm Paul McCartney', and a lot of the times you were right, and a lot of the times you were wrong. Same as we always are. But I can't see the answer to that, because you've suddenly got it all, you see.</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>  PAUL</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>  I really don't want you...</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>  JOHN</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>  (continuing)</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>  Well all right. I'm just telling you what I think. I don't— The Beatles revolve around the four people. It might a fucking job.</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>  PAUL</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>  (the power dynamic)</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>  You know, but I tell you what. I tell you one thing, what I think. The main thing is this: you have always been boss. Now I've been, sort of, secondary boss.</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>  JOHN</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>  Not always.</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>  PAUL</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>  (insistent)</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>  No, listen. Listen. No, always! Really, I mean, it is gonna be much better if we can actually just stick together and say, 'Look George, on 'I've Got A Feeling' I want you to do it exactly like I play it.' And he'll say, 'I'm not you, and I can't do it exactly like you do it.'</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>John considers this. There's truth in it.</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>  JOHN</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>  But this year, what you've been doing, and what everybody's been doing, I've not only felt guilty about the way we're all guilty about our relationship to each other, 'cause we could do more. And look, I'm not putting any blame on you. I've suddenly realised this, because that was my game, you know, but goals, they're still the same. Self-preservation, you know. I know what I like, I've let you do what you want and George too, you know.</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>  PAUL</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>  Yeah, I know.</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>  JOHN</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>  If we want him, if we do want him, I can go along with that, because the policy has kept us together.</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>  PAUL</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>  (the hope, or delusion)</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>  Well, I don't know, you know. See, I'm just assuming he's coming back. If he isn't, then he isn't, then it's a new problem. And probably when we're all very old, we'll all agree with each other, and we'll all sing together.</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>A pause. John circles back to the creative process itself.</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>  JOHN</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>  (trying to explain)</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>  And that's all I did on the last album was say, 'Okay, Paul, you're out to decide where my songs are concerned, arrangement-wise'. I don't know the songs, you know. I'd sooner just sing them, than have them turn into 'Mr. Kite', or anything else, where— I've accepted the problem from you that it needs arrangement. And then, because I'm an ape, I don't know. I don't see any further than me, the guitar, and the drums, and George Martin doing the— I don't hear any of the flutes playing, you know?</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>He makes a strumming gesture.</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>  JOHN (CONT'D)</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>  I suppose I could hear 'em if I sat down and worked very hard! I could turn out a mathematical drawing if you'd like, but I could never do it off me own backside, I always have to just— do that, you know?</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>  PAUL</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>  Yeah.</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>  JOHN</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>  I mean—</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>  PAUL</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>  (quiet, recognizing himself)</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>  Yeah. Yeah. I'm onto the same thing, you know. That's— that's— we're all at that. It is only, like, if you can just remember that we're— you know. That the four of us are trying to do that. Because I mean, all of those things you say, you know, in some way, apply to me. Not all ways—</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>  JOHN</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>  Yes, yes, because everything applies a little bit to you, too.</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>  PAUL</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>  —it is just you saying it. They're all— you know, in some way, to some degree, will apply to me.</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>  JOHN</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>  (the pattern repeating)</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>  'Cause once there was a period where none of us could actually, uh, say anything, about your criticisms.</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>  PAUL</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>  (quiet)</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>  Yeah. Yeah.</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>  JOHN</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>  (bleak)</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>  'Cause you would reject it all.</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>  PAUL</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>  (accepting it)</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>  Yeah, sure.</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>  JOHN</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>  And so George and I would just go— you know, 'I'll give you a line here,' 'Okay,' you know, 'We'll do four in a bar, and I'll do...' And a lot of the times you were right.</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>  PAUL</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>  Yeah.</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>  JOHN</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>  But a lot of the times you were— the same as they always are. But I can't see the answer to that.</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>  PAUL</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>  (trying to find the silver lining)</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>  No, but— no, that's good you see. The thing is, like, within each other, within ourselves, we reach something that's nearly perfect. And everyone else who's listening will think, 'That's it. They've got it.' You know— you know what I mean. So okay, we know we nearly made it, but we've really made it, for everyone else.</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>He's building momentum, trying to convince himself as much as John.</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>  PAUL (CONT'D)</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>  'Cause it's okay, we're into the fine, finest, finest technicalities— I mean, that's where it's at, you know. If one day, we can even keep all— if all the people who are listening to this, nearly nearly made it, they'll think we've made it, you know. They'll think that's it.</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>  JOHN</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>  (bringing it back to George)</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>  You see, the point is now— George— is we both did that to George, this time.</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>  PAUL</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>  Mm.</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>  JOHN</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>  And because of the build up to it, that— now he can't even take that.</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>  PAUL</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>  (the harsh truth)</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>  Treating him a bit like a mongrel, yeah.</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>  JOHN</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>  He can't even— you know. It's like if I say, 'Alright, take it,' he'll say, 'Well, look, I can't take it. I'll forget it.'</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>  PAUL</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>  Yeah...</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>  JOHN</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>  I have to, uh—</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>  PAUL</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>  'Cause he knows what we're all about.</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>  JOHN</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>  Yeah.</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>  PAUL</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>  So he knows that when we say, 'Take it,' we expect doo-doo-duh-duh-doo. If I said that, then you'd expect—</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>  JOHN</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>  But it's just that bit. The bit where we've— 'I've Got A Feeling'.</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>  PAUL</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>  Yeah.</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>  JOHN</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>  We— there's no way we could have translated it to him, to say... you know.</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>They sit in silence for a moment.

APPLE STUDIOS - BASEMENT - DAY (JANUARY 27, 1969)\r\n\r\nThe same space, but it feels completely different now. There's energy here. Purpose. Joy.\r\n\r\nJOHN LENNON (28), PAUL MCCARTNEY (26), GEORGE HARRISON (25), and RINGO STARR (28) are locked in, working on \"Get Back.\" BILLY PRESTON (23) is at the electric piano, now fully part of the sound.\r\n\r\nThey've been at this for hours, trying to nail the perfect take. But it's not frustrating - it's fun. They're experimenting, laughing, goofing around between takes.\r\n\r\nGEORGE MARTIN and GLYN JOHNS watch from the control room, making notes, adjusting levels.\r\n\r\n  PAUL\r\n  (to the band)\r\n  Let's try varying the tempo a bit. Just slightly.\r\n\r\nThey launch into another version. It's fast, loose. Paul starts singing the first verse in mock Japanese, throwing in phrases from \"Rowan & Martin's Laugh-In.\"\r\n\r\n  PAUL (CONT'D)\r\n  (singing)\r\n  Sock it to me!\r\n\r\nEveryone laughs. The take falls apart, but nobody cares.\r\n\r\n  GEORGE\r\n  (grinning)\r\n  Try it again, but slower this time.\r\n\r\nAnother take. John experiments with a different guitar solo. It's getting closer. You can feel it.\r\n\r\n  PAUL\r\n  (after they finish)\r\n  Nearly!\r\n\r\nThey're close. Everyone can feel it. This is the one.\r\n\r\nJohn leans into the microphone, and with perfect Liverpudlian deadpan, delivers the line:\r\n\r\n  JOHN\r\n  Sweet Loretta Fart, she thought she was a cleaner, but she was a frying pan... picks with his fingers.\r\n\r\nThe room erupts in laughter. Paul is doubled over. George is shaking his head, grinning. Ringo taps his sticks together, waiting.\r\n\r\n  PAUL\r\n  (still laughing)\r\n  Right, let's do it.\r\n\r\nThey count in. And this time, everything clicks.\r\n\r\nThe intro crashes in - that iconic opening chord, Ringo's drum fill. Paul's voice, strong and confident. John's guitar cutting through. George's wah-wah solo that sounds effortless. Billy's piano making it all come together.\r\n\r\nThis is it. This is THE take.\r\n\r\nThey're all locked in, smiling as they play. Paul and John catch each other's eyes during a harmony - for a moment, they're just two kids from Liverpool making music together.\r\n\r\nThe song builds to the ending. The iconic \"Oooh\" from Paul.\r\n\r\nAnd then... nothing. Silence.\r\n\r\nRingo forgot to come back in.\r\n\r\n  GEORGE\r\n  (after a beat)\r\n  We missed that end, didn't we?\r\n\r\nEveryone looks at each other. In the control room, George Martin leans into the talkback.\r\n\r\n  GEORGE MARTIN\r\n  I thought you were going on. Do you want to end it like that?\r\n\r\n  RINGO\r\n  (practical)\r\n  Just plug it on – the best end we did.\r\n\r\nA moment of consideration. Then nods all around. They know what they've got - the perfect take, even with the flubbed ending. They can fix it later.\r\n\r\n  PAUL\r\n  (grinning)\r\n  That's it. That's the one.\r\n\r\n  JOHN\r\n  (to Billy)\r\n  Beautiful, Bill.\r\n\r\nBilly beams. He's just played on a Beatles single.\r\n\r\nBut they're not done celebrating. Someone suggests they do it again - this time in German.\r\n\r\nWhat follows is pure Beatles chaos. Mock German lyrics throughout. Paul throwing in a phrase: \"Yah, that's good, Jackie!\" referencing Jackie Lomax. The final verse in terrible French.\r\n\r\nThey're celebrating. The pressure's off. They've got their single. Now they can just have fun.\r\n\r\nIn the control room, Glyn Johns is shaking his head, smiling. He's been mixing their takes overnight for days. He knows what he heard - they've just recorded something special.\r\n\r\nThe German version devolves into laughter. They finish with a flourish, instruments crashing to a halt.\r\n\r\n  PAUL\r\n  (to everyone)\r\n  Right then. We're getting somewhere.\r\n\r\n  JOHN\r\n  (lighting a cigarette)\r\n  About bloody time.\r\n\r\nBut he's smiling. They're all smiling.\r\n\r\nFor the first time since Twickenham, The Beatles look like a band again. Not four people trapped in a cold studio, but four musicians who chose to make music together.\r\n\r\nBilly Preston watches them, still amazed to be here. George catches his eye and gives him a nod - thank you.\r\n\r\nThe cameras capture it all. Not dissolution this time. Creation.\r\n\r\nFADE TO BLACK.\r\n\r\nSCENE END\r\n```","src/content/scenes/act-2/s19b-6-sweet-loretta-fart.md","df1db61156bea237",{html:886,metadata:887},"<pre class=\"astro-code github-dark\" style=\"background-color:#24292e;color:#e1e4e8; overflow-x: auto;\" tabindex=\"0\" data-language=\"text\"><code><span class=\"line\"><span>SCENE START</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>Sweet Loretta Fart</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>FADE IN:</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>INT.

Everyone can feel it. This is the one.</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>John leans into the microphone, and with perfect Liverpudlian deadpan, delivers the line:</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>  JOHN</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>  Sweet Loretta Fart, she thought she was a cleaner, but she was a frying pan... picks with his fingers.</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>The room erupts in laughter.

And this time, everything clicks.</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>The intro crashes in - that iconic opening chord, Ringo's drum fill. Paul's voice, strong and confident. John's guitar cutting through. George's wah-wah solo that sounds effortless. Billy's piano making it all come together.</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>This is it. This is THE take.</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>They're all locked in, smiling as they play. Paul and John catch each other's eyes during a harmony - for a moment, they're just two kids from Liverpool making music together.</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>The song builds to the ending. The iconic \"Oooh\" from Paul.</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>And then... nothing. Silence.</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>Ringo forgot to come back in.</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>  GEORGE</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>  (after a beat)</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>  We missed that end, didn't we?</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>Everyone looks at each other.

Then nods all around. They know what they've got - the perfect take, even with the flubbed ending. They can fix it later.</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>  PAUL</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>  (grinning)</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>  That's it.

He's just played on a Beatles single.</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>But they're not done celebrating. Someone suggests they do it again - this time in German.</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>What follows is pure Beatles chaos. Mock German lyrics throughout. Paul throwing in a phrase: \"Yah, that's good, Jackie!\" referencing Jackie Lomax. The final verse in terrible French.</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>They're celebrating. The pressure's off. They've got their single. Now they can just have fun.</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>In the control room, Glyn Johns is shaking his head, smiling. He's been mixing their takes overnight for days. He knows what he heard - they've just recorded something special.</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>The German version devolves into laughter.

APPLE STUDIOS - BASEMENT - DAY (JANUARY 22, 1969)\r\n\r\nA different space entirely from Twickenham. Smaller, warmer. The basement of 3 Savile Row. Equipment is more cramped but feels more intimate. This is their space.\r\n\r\nGEORGE HARRISON (25) is back. He's been back for two days, since the move to Apple Studios. But the atmosphere is still tentative, careful. Everyone walking on eggshells.\r\n\r\nJOHN LENNON (28), PAUL MCCARTNEY (26), and RINGO STARR (28) are working through \"I've Got A Feeling\" but something's missing. The energy isn't there.\r\n\r\nYOKO ONO (36) sits nearby. GEORGE MARTIN watches from the control area. MICHAEL LINDSAY-HOGG's cameras are still rolling.\r\n\r\nThey finish a run-through. It's... fine. Just fine.\r\n\r\nThen GEORGE looks up, sees someone at the door.\r\n\r\nBILLY PRESTON (23), impossibly young, impossibly talented, stands there with a huge smile. He's in London touring with Ray Charles.\r\n\r\n  GEORGE\r\n  (genuine warmth breaking through)\r\n  Billy!\r\n\r\nGeorge crosses to him, grabs his arm.\r\n\r\n  GEORGE (CONT'D)\r\n  Remember Billy? Here he is.\r\n\r\nHe practically drags Billy into the studio. The energy shifts immediately - George has brought a guest, and suddenly everyone has to be on their best behavior.\r\n\r\n  JOHN\r\n  (to Billy, enthusiastic)\r\n  Every number's got a piano part. And normally we overdub it. But this time we wanna do it live.\r\n\r\n  BILLY\r\n  (excited)\r\n  Yeah. That'd be nice.\r\n\r\n  JOHN\r\n  I mean, just live to ourselves... Straight off, one number after the other. And that means having somebody in on it.\r\n\r\n  GEORGE\r\n  If you'd like to do that you're welcome.\r\n\r\n  BILLY\r\n  Sure. Beautiful.\r\n\r\n  JOHN\r\n  Right. And then you'd be on the album.\r\n\r\n  BILLY\r\n  (can't believe it)\r\n  You're kidding.\r\n\r\nBilly looks around at The Beatles - the actual Beatles - inviting him to play on their album.\r\n\r\n  JOHN\r\n  Well, that's good then. We've taped a few. The thing is to get some tapes made of what we've done, and let him have a listen, take 'em home at night.\r\n\r\n  GEORGE\r\n  (knowing better)\r\n  He'll probably pick them up much quicker hearing us play 'em.\r\n\r\n  PAUL\r\n  Yeah, just rehearsing them.\r\n\r\nJohn spots George Martin in the control room.\r\n\r\n  JOHN\r\n  Have you met Billy, George?\r\n\r\nGEORGE MARTIN (43) comes over, extends his hand.\r\n\r\n  GEORGE MARTIN\r\n  How do you do, Billy?\r\n\r\n  JOHN\r\n  That's George Martin, our A&R man. That's Billy. We played with him in Hamburg. He was backing Little Richard.\r\n\r\n  PAUL\r\n  (with a nostalgic smile)\r\n  In the old days.\r\n\r\nBilly sits at the electric piano. There's a moment of anticipation. The Beatles haven't sounded right in weeks. Can this really help?\r\n\r\n  PAUL (CONT'D)\r\n  Let's try \"I've Got A Feeling.\"\r\n\r\nThey count it in.\r\n\r\nAnd something magical happens.\r\n\r\nBilly's fingers find the keys. The electric piano cuts through the arrangement like sunlight through clouds. His playing is joyful, effortless, perfect.\r\n\r\nPaul and John sing together. George's guitar finds its groove. Ringo locks in.\r\n\r\nFor the first time in weeks - maybe months - The Beatles sound like The Beatles.\r\n\r\nThey're all smiling. Actually smiling. Paul catches John's eye and grins. George is nodding along, looking relieved. Even Ringo, usually so steady, has a huge smile on his face.\r\n\r\nThe song builds, and Billy just floats around their parts, filling in the spaces, making everything better.\r\n\r\nWhen they finish, there's a moment of stunned silence.\r\n\r\nThen JOHN turns to Billy, beaming.\r\n\r\n  JOHN\r\n  You're in the group!\r\n\r\nEveryone laughs. Real laughter. The kind they haven't had in this whole ordeal.\r\n\r\n  PAUL\r\n  (grinning)\r\n  Do you play violin?\r\n\r\nMore laughter.\r\n\r\nBilly looks at them, eyes wide as saucers, hardly believing what just happened.\r\n\r\nIn the control room, GLYN JOHNS is already making notes. This is it. This is the sound.\r\n\r\nGEORGE HARRISON watches Billy at the keyboard, watches his bandmates smiling, and there's something in his expression - pride, relief, maybe a little sadness too. He brought Billy here. He saved the sessions. But he knows it took an outsider to make them behave.\r\n\r\nLater, George will say to the camera: \"Having this fifth person was just enough to cut the ice that we'd created among ourselves. Billy didn't know all the politics and the games that had been going on, so in his innocence he got stuck in and gave an extra little kick to the band.\"\r\n\r\nBut right now, in this moment, they're just playing music together. And for the first time in a long time, it feels good.\r\n\r\nThey count in another song. \"Don't Let Me Down.\"\r\n\r\n  JOHN\r\n  (to Billy, encouraging)\r\n  Hit it, Bill!\r\n\r\nBilly launches into a solo. John grins.\r\n\r\n  JOHN (CONT'D)\r\n  Oh, yeah! One more!\r\n\r\nThe cameras capture it all. The Beatles, energized. Playing together. Actually enjoying themselves.\r\n\r\nIt won't solve everything. The underlying problems are still there. But right now, with Billy Preston at the electric piano, making the songs come alive, it feels like maybe - just maybe - The Beatles can still be The Beatles.\r\n\r\nFADE OUT.\r\n\r\nSCENE END\r\n```","src/content/scenes/act-2/s19b-5-billy-preston-arrives.md","864fa0e718b2ce08",{html:920,metadata:921},"<pre class=\"astro-code github-dark\" style=\"background-color:#24292e;color:#e1e4e8; overflow-x: auto;\" tabindex=\"0\" data-language=\"text\"><code><span class=\"line\"><span>SCENE START</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>Billy Preston Arrives</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>FADE IN:</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>INT.

APPLE STUDIOS - CONTROL ROOM - DAY (JANUARY 25, 1969)\r\n\r\nPAUL MCCARTNEY (26) sits in the control room, listening to playbacks with JOHN LENNON (28), GEORGE HARRISON (25), and RINGO STARR (28). MICHAEL LINDSAY-HOGG (30s) and GLYN JOHNS watch them.\r\n\r\nThe last few days have been good - better than Twickenham. Billy Preston helped. But something's eating at Paul. He's frustrated in a different way now.\r\n\r\n  MICHAEL LINDSAY-HOGG\r\n  Originally, it was a show and an album. A live album recorded when the show was actually live on the spot. And what I think is lacking at the moment is the show.\r\n\r\n  JOHN\r\n  I would dig to play onstage, you know? I mean, if it was all... everything was all right and there was no messing and we're just gonna play onstage. You know, that's why I said yes to the TV show. I didn't want the hell of doing it, but nobody else wants to go on the stage or do a TV show. You know, that's what it's about. Nobody wants to get out there. You know?\r\n\r\n  PAUL\r\n  (admitting it)\r\n  I suppose that's true, you know?\r\n\r\n  GEORGE\r\n  The things that have worked out best ever for us haven't really been planned any more than this has. It's just, you know, it's like you just go into something and it does it itself. You know, whatever it's gonna be, it becomes that, you know?\r\n\r\n  JOHN\r\n  (to Paul, gently)\r\n  See, it's turned out it's not what Paul wants. It's like if it's... Say it's his number, this whole show. It's actually turned into our number more than his number. That's all. And, uh... It's just that, really.\r\n\r\n  PAUL\r\n  Yeah, I know, it is majority decisions and all. Yeah.\r\n\r\nPaul's quiet for a moment. Then it comes out.\r\n\r\n  PAUL (CONT'D)\r\n  I just have a feeling that we... It's all right, you know? It's nothing to complain about, but... But it's just funny to sort of realize that after this is all over, you'll be off in a black bag somewhere on the Albert Hall, you know?\r\n\r\n  MICHAEL LINDSAY-HOGG\r\n  (hitting it)\r\n  What you're moaning about is there's no payoff.\r\n\r\n  PAUL\r\n  (the need surfacing)\r\n  I think all I wanna do is, like, uh... I probably, you know, having got it together, I probably just wanna go and have fun with it. Rather than just, sort of, finish off exactly as we started. And I'd like to sort of do a... for the finish. And we just get out in the open, change of scene, and go and do it somewhere else, do it on a live show, do it on a stage. You know, I'd like to light a rocket and really sort of take off for the end of it.\r\n\r\nThere's a moment of silence. Then Glyn Johns and Michael exchange a look.\r\n\r\n  MICHAEL LINDSAY-HOGG\r\n  What if we went up to the roof?\r\n\r\nEveryone looks at him.\r\n\r\n  GLYN JOHNS\r\n  Ringo was just showing me - there's a wonderful view up there. Big flat area.\r\n\r\n  MICHAEL LINDSAY-HOGG\r\n  (the idea taking shape)\r\n  You could play to the whole West End from up there.\r\n\r\nPaul's face changes. You can see it - the idea catching fire.\r\n\r\nCUT TO:\r\n\r\nEXT. APPLE STUDIOS - ROOFTOP - DAY\r\n\r\nPAUL, RINGO, GLYN JOHNS, MICHAEL LINDSAY-HOGG, and MAL EVANS climb the stairs to the roof of 3 Savile Row.\r\n\r\nThey emerge onto a large flat rooftop. The view stretches across London - the West End spreading out before them. It's January cold, but clear.\r\n\r\nPaul walks to the edge, looking out over the city. For the first time in weeks, there's real excitement in his eyes.\r\n\r\n  RINGO\r\n  (gesturing around)\r\n  Told you. Great view.\r\n\r\n  GLYN JOHNS\r\n  If they wanted to play to a large crowd, why not play on the roof to the whole of the West End?\r\n\r\nPaul turns, looking at the space. Imagining it. Amps up here. Ringo's drums. The cameras. Playing to all of London.\r\n\r\n  PAUL\r\n  (the energy building)\r\n  Yeah. Yeah, we could do this.\r\n\r\n  MICHAEL LINDSAY-HOGG\r\n  The only thing is we've got to get some permission, Paul. So the cops don't come and throw us off, that's all.\r\n\r\n  RINGO\r\n  What happens if we go on top of the other roof?\r\n\r\n  MICHAEL LINDSAY-HOGG\r\n  If it's somebody else's roof, then we can get had not only for disturbing the peace and the noise, but also for trespassing.\r\n\r\nBut Paul's not worried about that. He's seeing it now - the climax he's been wanting. The payoff.\r\n\r\n  PAUL\r\n  The Savile Row police station is only a couple of hundred yards away. They'll probably shut us down pretty quick.\r\n\r\n  GLYN JOHNS\r\n  (grinning)\r\n  That'll all be part of the fun, won't it?\r\n\r\nPaul laughs. Actually laughs. The first real, unguarded laugh in weeks.\r\n\r\n  MAL EVANS\r\n  (practical)\r\n  So, but just roughly timewise, so I can look into gear...\r\n\r\n  PAUL\r\n  Yeah. So, okay, look, if we say like on Friday or something.\r\n\r\nThey stand there for a moment, looking out over London. The city sprawling below them. The Beatles - or what's left of them - about to do something nobody's ever done before.\r\n\r\nCUT TO:\r\n\r\nINT. APPLE STUDIOS - BASEMENT - DAY\r\n\r\nBack downstairs. Paul bursts in with energy the others haven't seen in ages.\r\n\r\n  PAUL\r\n  Right, we're doing it on the roof.\r\n\r\nJOHN and GEORGE look up from their instruments.\r\n\r\n  JOHN\r\n  What?\r\n\r\n  PAUL\r\n  (grinning)\r\n  The rooftop. Wednesday or Thursday. We set up on the roof and play to all of London.\r\n\r\n  MICHAEL LINDSAY-HOGG\r\n  I think the thing is we'll aim for Thursday.\r\n\r\n  GEORGE HARRISON\r\n  Are we gonna do it all here now?\r\n\r\n  GEORGE MARTIN\r\n  (entering, practical)\r\n  I think you should aim for a little earlier than Thursday. 'Cause if you aim for Thursday, it's not gonna be Thursday.\r\n\r\n  PAUL\r\n  See, we have to give them a chance to get their other cameras in.\r\n\r\n  MICHAEL LINDSAY-HOGG\r\n  (with Ringo)\r\n  Aim for Wednesday.\r\n\r\n  PAUL\r\n  It'll be pretty quick, but it'll still give us some time to do it.\r\n\r\nJohn watches Paul's excitement. There's something in his expression - maybe relief, maybe amusement. But he's nodding.\r\n\r\n  JOHN\r\n  All right then. Wednesday it is.\r\n\r\nGeorge looks uncertain, but he's not arguing. Ringo's already thinking about the logistics.\r\n\r\nFor the first time since they walked into Twickenham Film Studios nearly a month ago, they have a plan they all agree on. A goal. A climax.\r\n\r\nPaul stands there, energized, alive. The rooftop concert.\r\n\r\n  PAUL\r\n  (to everyone)\r\n  Right. Let's rehearse. We've got three days.\r\n\r\nThey pick up their instruments. And for the first time in weeks, there's purpose in the room.\r\n\r\nThe Beatles are going to play a concert. On a rooftop. In the middle of London. And nobody - not even them - knows how it's going to turn out.\r\n\r\nBut that's the point.\r\n\r\nFADE TO BLACK.\r\n\r\nSCENE END\r\n```","src/content/scenes/act-2/s19b-7-the-rooftop.md","a182a4560cfc7d17",{html:954,metadata:955},"<pre class=\"astro-code github-dark\" style=\"background-color:#24292e;color:#e1e4e8; overflow-x: auto;\" tabindex=\"0\" data-language=\"text\"><code><span class=\"line\"><span>SCENE START</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>The Rooftop</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>FADE IN:</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>INT.

PAUL MCCARTNEY'S HOME, CAVENDISH AVENUE - DAY (NOVEMBER 1969)\r\n\r\nA sanctuary of curated calm. Sunlight streams into the living room, illuminating a space that is both a creative workshop and a family haven. A grand piano sits in the corner. Guitars are on stands. The room is tidy, warm, domestic.\r\n\r\nPAUL MCCARTNEY (27) sits on a plush sofa, strumming a gentle, unformed melody on an acoustic guitar. He looks relaxed, a rare moment of peace.\r\n\r\nLINDA EASTMAN (28), camera around her neck, smiles as she watches him. Their young daughter, HEATHER, plays quietly on the floor with wooden blocks.\r\n\r\n  LINDA\r\n  That's a nice one. What is it?\r\n\r\n  PAUL\r\n  (Shrugs, smiling)\r\n  Don't know yet. It's just... there.\r\n\r\nThe gentle CLATTER of the letterbox flap breaks the quiet.\r\n\r\n  LINDA\r\n  Post is here.\r\n\r\nShe gets up and retrieves a small stack of mail from the floor. She flips through it. Bills, fan mail... and one other.\r\n\r\n  LINDA (CONT'D)\r\n  Oh. This one looks important.\r\n\r\nShe hands him a thick, cream-colored envelope. It bears a royal crest, embossed in gold. It's addressed simply to \"P. McCartney, Esq.\"\r\n\r\nPaul puts his guitar aside. He takes the envelope, a flicker of curiosity on his face. He studies the crest.\r\n\r\n  PAUL\r\n  Blimey. What's this then?\r\n\r\nHe carefully breaks the wax seal with his thumbnail and pulls out a single sheet of heavy, watermarked paper.\r\n\r\nHe reads. His eyes widen. A slow, incredulous smile spreads across his face. He looks up at Linda, completely stunned.\r\n\r\n  PAUL (CONT'D)\r\n  You're not going to believe this.\r\n\r\n  LINDA\r\n  What is it?\r\n\r\n  PAUL\r\n  (Reading aloud, his voice a mix of awe and disbelief)\r\n  \"...Her Majesty the Queen has been graciously pleased to approve the recommendation that you be appointed a Knight Bachelor... for your services to music...\"\r\n\r\nHe lets the letter fall to his lap, shaking his head.\r\n\r\n  PAUL (CONT'D)\r\n  A knighthood. They want to make me a knight.\r\n\r\nLinda's face breaks into a huge, delighted grin. She throws her arms around him.\r\n\r\n  LINDA\r\n  Paul, that's incredible! Sir Paul! Oh, my God!\r\n\r\nPaul laughs, a genuine, joyful sound. He hugs her back tightly. For a moment, he is purely happy. The honor, the recognition. His dad would have been so proud.\r\n\r\n  PAUL\r\n\r\n  \"Arise, Sir Paul...\"\r\n  (He chuckles)\r\n  Can you believe it?\r\n\r\nHe picks up the letter again, re-reading it. The smile on his face slowly begins to fade. The joy is replaced by a creeping puzzlement.\r\n\r\n  PAUL (CONT'D)\r\n  (More to himself)\r\n  But... why? Why now?\r\n\r\n  LINDA\r\n  What do you mean, 'why'? Because you're a genius! You deserve it.\r\n\r\n  PAUL\r\n  No, I mean... the timing. The band's a mess. John's... well, he's John. It feels... odd.\r\n\r\nHis mind starts to race. The warm, safe room suddenly feels colder.\r\n\r\nQUICK FLASHBACK - INT. INDICA GALLERY - DAY (1968)\r\n\r\nA subjective memory. Paul's POV. He sees YOKO across the gallery. She's in deep, intense conversation with KLAUS (CLIVE). The audio is distorted, muffled. Klaus leans in, his gestures sharp, conspiratorial. It doesn't look like a chat about art. It looks like a briefing.\r\n\r\nBACK TO SCENE\r\n\r\nPaul's expression has hardened. The pieces are clicking into place in his mind, but they're all the wrong pieces.\r\n\r\n  PAUL\r\n  That German bloke. At Yoko's gallery.\r\n\r\n  LINDA\r\n  The art critic? Klaus?\r\n\r\n  PAUL\r\n  He wasn't a critic. He was something else. They've been meeting. Whispering. And now this...\r\n  (He holds up the letter as if it's evidence)\r\n  ...this arrives.\r\n\r\nLinda looks at him, completely lost.\r\n\r\n  LINDA\r\n  Paul, what are you talking about? This is a good thing.\r\n\r\n  PAUL\r\n  (Shaking his head, his voice low and urgent)\r\n  Don't you see? It's not a reward, Linda. It's a weapon.\r\n\r\nHe stands up, pacing the room. His sanctuary has been violated.\r\n\r\n  PAUL (CONT'D)\r\n  They're trying to split us. It's her. She's got her hooks in him, turning him against everything we were. And now the establishment... they're helping her.\r\n\r\nHis paranoia is now a torrent.\r\n\r\n  PAUL (CONT'D)\r\n  They make him the revolutionary clown, the one who's gone mad. And me? They make me 'Sir Paul'. The good one. The safe one. The one who plays by the rules. It drives a wedge right down the middle of us.\r\n\r\nHe stops pacing and looks at the letter in his hand with utter disgust. The honor has become a brand, a mark of treason against his friend.\r\n\r\n  PAUL (CONT'D)\r\n  (Quietly, fiercely)\r\n  They are not taking him from me.\r\n\r\nHe crushes the letter slightly in his fist. The melody he was strumming is forgotten. The domestic peace is shattered.\r\n\r\nLinda watches him, her face a mask of worry. She sees a man she loves retreating into a world of suspicion she cannot enter.\r\n\r\nFADE OUT.\r\n\r\nSCENE END\r\n```","src/content/scenes/act-2/s20-letter-from-the-queen.md","ddbfc13b80d5fa31",{html:983,metadata:984},"<pre class=\"astro-code github-dark\" style=\"background-color:#24292e;color:#e1e4e8; overflow-x: auto;\" tabindex=\"0\" data-language=\"text\"><code><span class=\"line\"><span>SCENE START</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>INT.

APPLE CORPS BOARDROOM - DAY (NOVEMBER 1969)\r\n\r\nThe room is stylish, expensive, and cold. The four Beatles are assembled around a large, polished table. The mood is thick with dread.\r\n\r\nPAUL (27) paces at the head of the table, radiating a tense, aggressive energy. In his hand is the crumpled, forged knighthood letter.\r\n\r\nJOHN (29) sits opposite, utterly disengaged. He doodles on a notepad. YOKO (36) is beside him, a silent, still presence.\r\n\r\nGEORGE (26) stares out the window at Savile Row, having already mentally left the room.\r\n\r\nRINGO (29) sits between them all, anxiously tapping his fingers on the table, the unwilling witness to a family's collapse.\r\n\r\n  PAUL\r\n  (Stopping his pacing)\r\n  Right. I called this meeting because things have gone too far. There are... forces at play here. Trying to tear us apart. And we need to face it.\r\n\r\nHis eyes are fixed on Yoko. John doesn't look up from his doodle.\r\n\r\n  JOHN\r\n  (Muttering)\r\n  Here we go. St. Paul's sermon on the mount.\r\n\r\n  PAUL\r\n  (Ignoring him, his voice rising)\r\n  I'm serious, John! You can't see it because you're too close to it, but I can. The whispers. The outsiders. The way they're trying to turn you against me. Against us.\r\n\r\nHe gestures vaguely with the letter, the \"evidence\" for his paranoid theory. He is so full of righteous fury, he's practically shaking.\r\n\r\n  PAUL (CONT'D)\r\n  This isn't about music anymore. This is about... infiltration. And we have to fight it. We have to be a band again.\r\n\r\nHe looks around the table, pleading. But no one meets his eye. He's trying to rally troops who have already deserted.\r\n\r\nBefore Paul can present his \"evidence,\" John slowly puts his pencil down. He looks up, not at Paul, but at the center of the table. His expression is flat, devoid of emotion.\r\n\r\n  JOHN\r\n  I'm leaving the group.\r\n\r\nThe words hang in the air, simple and brutal. Paul stops dead. His entire argument, his whole paranoid structure, collapses into dust.\r\n\r\n  PAUL\r\n  (Confused)\r\n  What? What are you talking about? We're talking about how to save it...\r\n\r\n  JOHN\r\n  (Cutting him off, still calm)\r\n  No, *you're* talking about how to save it. I'm not. It's over.\r\n  (He looks at Paul for the first time)\r\n  I want a divorce.\r\n\r\nThe room falls into a stunning, absolute silence.\r\n\r\nPaul's face goes blank with shock. He came in for a fight, armed and ready, only to find the war was long over.\r\n\r\nGeorge turns from the window. A small, almost imperceptible nod. A quiet exhale of relief. He's free.\r\n\r\nRingo's face crumples. He looks utterly heartbroken.\r\n\r\nCUT TO:\r\n\r\nINT. MI5 SURVEILLANCE VAN - CONTINUOUS\r\n\r\nNIGEL (52) and CLIVE (45) listen through their headphones.\r\n\r\n  CLIVE\r\n  (Tearing his headset off, leaping to his feet in the cramped space)\r\n  YES! HE SAID IT! HE SAID THE THING!\r\n  (He punches the air)\r\n  SUCCESSFUL FRACTURING! OPERATIONAL OBJECTIVE ACHIEVED! THE KLAUS METHODOLOGY WORKS!\r\n\r\nNigel doesn't move. He slowly takes off his own headphones, placing them carefully on the console. He closes his eyes, pinching the bridge of his nose. The weight of the last four years settles on him. There is no triumph on his face, only a profound, weary sadness.\r\n\r\nBACK TO SCENE\r\n\r\nIn the boardroom, the silence stretches. Paul sinks into a chair, the crumpled letter falling from his hand onto the table. It lies there, a pathetic, meaningless prop.\r\n\r\n  PAUL\r\n  (A whisper)\r\n  ...a divorce?\r\n\r\n  JOHN\r\n  (Standing up, Yoko rising with him)\r\n  It was fun while it lasted.\r\n\r\nHe says it without malice or sentiment. It's just a fact. He walks toward the door, not looking back. The band is already in his past.\r\n\r\nPaul watches him go, completely and utterly blindsided. The real conspiracy wasn't the one he imagined. It was the one he never saw.\r\n\r\nFADE OUT.\r\n\r\nSCENE END\r\n```","src/content/scenes/act-2/s21-i-want-a-divorce.md","8aab0bfa77ecd00f",{html:1017,metadata:1018},"<pre class=\"astro-code github-dark\" style=\"background-color:#24292e;color:#e1e4e8; overflow-x: auto;\" tabindex=\"0\" data-language=\"text\"><code><span class=\"line\"><span>SCENE START</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>INT.

It's perfectly ghastly. I adore it.\r\n\r\nPhilip is no longer listening. He's staring at the letter, his knuckles white. He thought he had broken Lennon. Instead, Lennon has rejected *him*. He has taken Philip's victory and used it as a platform for his own grubby politics.\r\n\r\n  THE QUEEN\r\n  (Calmly)\r\n  It's an emotional gesture from an emotional young man. It will be a footnote in a week. The best response is no response.\r\n\r\nBut Philip is beyond reason.

He spat on it.\r\n  (He looks at the Queen, his eyes burning)\r\n  He spat on *you*.\r\n\r\n  THE QUEEN\r\n  (Firmly)\r\n  He spat on a symbol, Philip. It is my job to be a symbol. It's a singer having a tantrum. Let it go.\r\n\r\n  PRINCE PHILIP\r\n  Let it go? We spent four years on this. We fractured them. We drove him to this. And he turns it into a... a press release for his wretched song!\r\n\r\nHe throws the crumpled letter onto the desk. He looks at Mountbatten, his face a mask of cold fury. The game is over.\r\n\r\n  PRINCE PHILIP (CONT'D)\r\n  He has made himself a political figure. A martyr. He's more dangerous now than he ever was with a guitar. This isn't over.\r\n\r\n  THE QUEEN\r\n  (A warning tone)\r\n  Philip. Be careful.\r\n\r\n  PRINCESS MARGARET\r\n  (A delighted whisper)\r\n  Oh, I do hope he won't be. This is getting frightfully interesting.\r\n\r\nPhilip ignores them both. His eyes are locked on Mountbatten's, his decision made. The personal insult has become a matter of national security.

BUCKINGHAM PALACE PRIVATE STUDY - NIGHT (LATE NOVEMBER 1969)\r\n\r\nThe room is dark, save for a single green-shaded lamp on the heavy desk, casting long, menacing shadows. The atmosphere is funereal.\r\n\r\nPRINCE PHILIP (48) stands by the fireplace, staring into the flames. He is unnervingly still. The explosive rage from the afternoon has cooled into something far more dangerous: icy, resolute calm.\r\n\r\nLORD MOUNTBATTEN (69) sits in a leather armchair, a glass of brandy untouched beside him.\r\n\r\nSIR DEREK FINCHLEY (58), the Deputy Director of MI5, sits opposite him, looking deeply uneasy. He holds a slim, empty portfolio on his lap. He was summoned, not invited.\r\n\r\nThe QUEEN is notably absent. This is not a state matter anymore. This is personal.\r\n\r\n  MOUNTBATTEN\r\n  (Breaking the silence)\r\n  The press is treating it as a celebrity tantrum. The Times called the 'Cold Turkey' reference 'gauche'. In a week, it will be forgotten. In a strategic sense, the operation was a success. The group is fractured beyond repair. The primary objective has been met.\r\n\r\nPhilip turns slowly from the fire. His face is a mask.\r\n\r\n  PRINCE PHILIP\r\n  The primary objective? Was it?\r\n  (He walks slowly toward the desk)\r\n  The objective, as I recall, was to neutralize a nuisance. To remind these people of the proper order of things.\r\n\r\nHe stops, looking down at Finchley, who shrinks slightly under his gaze.\r\n\r\n  PRINCE PHILIP (CONT'D)\r\n  Instead, we have created a political symbol. We have spent four years turning a court jester into a Joan of Arc. He's more dangerous now than he ever was with a guitar.\r\n\r\n  MOUNTBATTEN\r\n  He's a musician, Philip. His influence is... ephemeral.\r\n\r\n  PRINCE PHILIP\r\n  (A sharp, cold laugh)\r\n  Is it? He's met with prime ministers. He holds press conferences about world peace from a bed. He has the ear of an entire generation. And now, he has a legitimate grievance. He has our attention. And we gave it to him.\r\n\r\nFinchley shifts uncomfortably in his chair. He is a bureaucrat, a man of plausible deniability. This conversation is becoming dangerously concrete.\r\n\r\n  SIR DEREK FINCHLEY\r\n  Your Highness, MI5's official assessment is that while Lennon is a person of interest, he does not constitute a direct threat to national—\r\n\r\n  PRINCE PHILIP\r\n  (Cutting him off, his voice like ice)\r\n  Your 'official assessment' is a document designed to protect your pension, Sir Derek. I am talking about reality.\r\n  (He leans on the desk, his voice dropping)\r\n  The man has publicly accused the Crown of complicity in war. He has used an honour from the Sovereign as a political weapon. He is no longer a nuisance. He is a dissident. And dissidents... must be managed.\r\n\r\nMountbatten senses where this is going. He sits up, his expression hardening.\r\n\r\n  MOUNTBATTEN\r\n  Philip, we must be exceedingly careful here. Any overt action would be catastrophic.\r\n\r\n  PRINCE PHILIP\r\n  I am not suggesting an overt action. I am suggesting a final one.\r\n\r\nThe room goes utterly still. Finchley looks like he wants to dissolve into the floor. This is a line he never, ever wanted to cross.\r\n\r\n  PRINCE PHILIP (CONT'D)\r\n  Operation Minuet was a success in its tactics, but its strategy was flawed. It was a dance. It was about disruption. The terms have now changed.\r\n\r\nHe looks directly at Mountbatten, the command clear in his eyes.\r\n\r\n  PRINCE PHILIP (CONT'D)\r\n  Operation Minuet is terminated. Effective immediately.\r\n  (He pauses, letting the finality sink in)\r\n  We are activating a new protocol. Operation... 'Elegy'.\r\n\r\n  MOUNTBATTEN\r\n  (Quietly)\r\n  An elegy is a funeral song.\r\n\r\n  PRINCE PHILIP\r\n  Precisely. This is no longer about disruption, Dickie. This is about silencing a threat. Permanently.\r\n\r\nSir Derek Finchley visibly pales. This is no longer a cynical game of psychological manipulation. This is a royal directive for an assassination.\r\n\r\n  SIR DEREK FINCHLEY\r\n  (Stammering)\r\n  Your... Your Highness... that is... such a measure would be... unprecedented. The blowback...\r\n\r\n  PRINCE PHILIP\r\n  (Straightening up, his voice regaining its command)\r\n  The blowback for allowing a public figure to repeatedly and publicly defy the Crown is far greater. That is the very definition of sedition.\r\n  (To Mountbatten)\r\n  I want a plan. Quiet. Plausible. Final. Use the same assets. They are already compromised.\r\n\r\nMountbatten stares at his nephew, seeing the full extent of his obsession. The protector of the monarchy has become its greatest liability. But an order has been given.\r\n\r\n  MOUNTBATTEN\r\n  (After a long silence, a slight, almost imperceptible nod)\r\n  As you wish.\r\n\r\nPhilip turns back to the fire, his back to them both. The decision is made. The conversation is over.\r\n\r\nFinchley sits frozen, clutching his portfolio, a man trapped in a waking nightmare.

MI5 SAFE HOUSE - NIGHT (LATE NOVEMBER 1969)\r\n\r\nThe room is cold, lit by a single bare bulb. The air is stale with the ghosts of a thousand sordid secrets.\r\n\r\nSIR DEREK FINCHLEY (58), NIGEL FINCH (52), and CLIVE BARROW (45) sit around a cheap wooden table. An overflowing ashtray sits between them. Finchley looks as if he's just swallowed something foul but is maintaining his professional composure.\r\n\r\nThe mood is funereal.\r\n\r\n  SIR DEREK FINCHLEY\r\n  (Clears his throat)\r\n  Gentlemen. I have just come from a meeting at the highest level. A strategic reassessment has been made. Operation Minuet has been... concluded.\r\n\r\nClive looks momentarily confused, a schoolboy whose favorite game has been cancelled. Nigel says nothing, his face a mask of weary anticipation.\r\n\r\n  SIR DEREK FINCHLEY (CONT'D)\r\n  The operation's primary objective—the fracturing of the group—has been achieved. However, recent actions by the primary subject, Lennon, have created an unforeseen complication.\r\n\r\nHe opens a slim portfolio. It contains a single sheet of paper.\r\n\r\n  SIR DEREK FINCHLEY (CONT'D)\r\n  It is now the Palace's view that the subject no longer represents a cultural nuisance, but a political one. As such, a new directive has been issued.\r\n\r\nHe slides the paper across the table. It's a memo, typed, with no letterhead and no signature. It is a ghost.\r\n\r\n  SIR DEREK FINCHLEY (CONT'D)\r\n  The subject's file is to be closed. His activities are to be brought to a final conclusion. The matter is to be... permanently retired.\r\n\r\nHe delivers the lines in a flat, bureaucratic monotone. A man reading a weather report.\r\n\r\nClive leans forward, reading the memo. His eyes scan the euphemisms. A slow, strange smile spreads across his face. His eyes light up with a manic, creative glee.\r\n\r\n  CLIVE\r\n  (A hushed, reverent whisper)\r\n  A permanent resolution. My God. It's the third act.\r\n\r\nNigel stares at Finchley, his mind struggling to process the words.\r\n\r\n  NIGEL\r\n  Retired? Sir, I'm not sure I understand the... operational parameters.\r\n\r\n  SIR DEREK FINCHLEY\r\n  (Looking him dead in the eye)\r\n  I think you do, Nigel.\r\n\r\nThe truth lands. Nigel feels the blood drain from his face. He looks physically ill.\r\n\r\n  NIGEL\r\n  (Shaking his head, slowly)\r\n  No. Sir, with respect... that's not... that is not what we do. We are an intelligence service, not... not that.\r\n\r\n  CLIVE\r\n  (Interrupting, his mind already racing)\r\n  It's a question of methodology, Nigel! A final exit. It requires... artistry. A performance piece. Something public, but misdirecting. A charity concert, perhaps? The dramatic irony would be... sublime.\r\n\r\nNigel stares at Clive, horrified. Clive isn't seeing a man; he's seeing a plot point.\r\n\r\n  NIGEL\r\n  (To Finchley, pleading)\r\n  Sir Derek. This is assassination.\r\n\r\nHe says the word. The ugly, simple truth that Finchley's elegant euphemisms were designed to hide. The word hangs in the dead air of the room.\r\n\r\nFinchley's pleasant mask cracks, just for a second. His eyes turn to steel.\r\n\r\n  SIR DEREK FINCHLEY\r\n  This is a royal directive, Mr. Finch. This is not a request. It is not a debate. It is an order. Are you a loyal servant of the Crown, or are you not?\r\n\r\nThe threat is absolute, unspoken but perfectly clear.\r\n\r\n  NIGEL\r\n  I am a loyal servant. But this is... wrong.\r\n\r\n  SIR DEREK FINCHLEY\r\n  (Leaning forward, his voice a silken threat)\r\n  What is 'wrong' is a matter for philosophers. We are professionals. You have a few years left until your pension. One would hate to see such a long and... adequate career end on a note of insubordination. Consider your options. Carefully.\r\n\r\nHe stands, straightening his suit. The briefing is over.\r\n\r\n  SIR DEREK FINCHLEY (CONT'D)\r\n  I expect a preliminary plan on my desk by Monday.\r\n  (He looks at Clive)\r\n  Something... creative.\r\n\r\nHe exits, closing the door behind him with a soft CLICK.\r\n\r\nClive immediately pulls out a notebook and starts sketching frantically, muttering to himself.\r\n\r\n  CLIVE\r\n  The stage... the lighting... a distraction in the crowd... it has to be a masterpiece...\r\n\r\nNigel doesn't move. He sits at the table, utterly defeated. The bumbling comedy is over. He is now the partner of a killer-in-waiting, and an accessory to a state-sanctioned murder.\r\n\r\nHis face is a portrait of a man trapped between his duty, his pension, and a conscience he never knew he had until this exact moment. The path forward contains only terrible choices.\r\n\r\nFADE OUT.\r\n\r\nSCENE END","src/content/scenes/act-2/s25-operation-elegy.md","c7add8b6a56d5276",{html:1139,metadata:1140},"<pre class=\"astro-code github-dark\" style=\"background-color:#24292e;color:#e1e4e8; overflow-x: auto;\" tabindex=\"0\" data-language=\"text\"><code><span class=\"line\"><span>SCENE START</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>INT.

An overflowing ashtray sits between them. Finchley looks as if he's just swallowed something foul but is maintaining his professional composure.</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>The mood is funereal.</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>  SIR DEREK FINCHLEY</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>  (Clears his throat)</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>  Gentlemen. I have just come from a meeting at the highest level. A strategic reassessment has been made. Operation Minuet has been... concluded.</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>Clive looks momentarily confused, a schoolboy whose favorite game has been cancelled. Nigel says nothing, his face a mask of weary anticipation.</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>  SIR DEREK FINCHLEY (CONT'D)</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>  The operation's primary objective—the fracturing of the group—has been achieved. However, recent actions by the primary subject, Lennon, have created an unforeseen complication.</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>He opens a slim portfolio. It contains a single sheet of paper.</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>  SIR DEREK FINCHLEY (CONT'D)</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>  It is now the Palace's view that the subject no longer represents a cultural nuisance, but a political one. As such, a new directive has been issued.</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>He slides the paper across the table. It's a memo, typed, with no letterhead and no signature. It is a ghost.</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>  SIR DEREK FINCHLEY (CONT'D)</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>  The subject's file is to be closed. His activities are to be brought to a final conclusion. The matter is to be... permanently retired.</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>He delivers the lines in a flat, bureaucratic monotone. A man reading a weather report.</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>Clive leans forward, reading the memo. His eyes scan the euphemisms. A slow, strange smile spreads across his face. His eyes light up with a manic, creative glee.</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>  CLIVE</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>  (A hushed, reverent whisper)</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>  A permanent resolution. My God. It's the third act.</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>Nigel stares at Finchley, his mind struggling to process the words.</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>  NIGEL</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>  Retired? Sir, I'm not sure I understand the... operational parameters.</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>  SIR DEREK FINCHLEY</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>  (Looking him dead in the eye)</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>  I think you do, Nigel.</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>The truth lands. Nigel feels the blood drain from his face. He looks physically ill.</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>  NIGEL</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>  (Shaking his head, slowly)</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>  No. Sir, with respect... that's not... that is not what we do. We are an intelligence service, not... not that.</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>  CLIVE</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>  (Interrupting, his mind already racing)</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>  It's a question of methodology, Nigel! A final exit. It requires... artistry. A performance piece. Something public, but misdirecting. A charity concert, perhaps? The dramatic irony would be... sublime.</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>Nigel stares at Clive, horrified. Clive isn't seeing a man; he's seeing a plot point.</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>  NIGEL</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>  (To Finchley, pleading)</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>  Sir Derek. This is assassination.</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>He says the word. The ugly, simple truth that Finchley's elegant euphemisms were designed to hide. The word hangs in the dead air of the room.</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>Finchley's pleasant mask cracks, just for a second. His eyes turn to steel.</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>  SIR DEREK FINCHLEY</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>  This is a royal directive, Mr. Finch. This is not a request. It is not a debate. It is an order. Are you a loyal servant of the Crown, or are you not?</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>The threat is absolute, unspoken but perfectly clear.</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>  NIGEL</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>  I am a loyal servant. But this is... wrong.</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>  SIR DEREK FINCHLEY</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>  (Leaning forward, his voice a silken threat)</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>  What is 'wrong' is a matter for philosophers. We are professionals. You have a few years left until your pension. One would hate to see such a long and... adequate career end on a note of insubordination. Consider your options. Carefully.</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>He stands, straightening his suit. The briefing is over.</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>  SIR DEREK FINCHLEY (CONT'D)</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>  I expect a preliminary plan on my desk by Monday.</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>  (He looks at Clive)</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>  Something... creative.</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>He exits, closing the door behind him with a soft CLICK.</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>Clive immediately pulls out a notebook and starts sketching frantically, muttering to himself.</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>  CLIVE</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>  The stage... the lighting... a distraction in the crowd... it has to be a masterpiece...</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>Nigel doesn't move.

He is now the partner of a killer-in-waiting, and an accessory to a state-sanctioned murder.</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>His face is a portrait of a man trapped between his duty, his pension, and a conscience he never knew he had until this exact moment.

MI5 SAFE HOUSE - DAY (JANUARY 1970)\r\n\r\nA room of profound, bureaucratic misery. The color palette is a symphony of desaturated institutional beige and melancholic grey. Fluorescent lights hum with oppressive indifference.\r\n\r\nThe room is framed in a deadpan, symmetrical wide shot.\r\n\r\nSIR DEREK FINCHLEY (59) sits perfectly poised at the head of a cheap wooden table. He is the picture of calm, corporate authority. His slim leather portfolio sits closed before him.\r\n\r\nNIGEL FINCH (53) sits to his left, a statue of weary resignation. His teacup and saucer are aligned perfectly with the edge of the table.\r\n\r\nCLIVE BARROW (46) sits opposite, vibrating with a nervous energy the room cannot contain.\r\n\r\nThe air is thick with the unspoken gravity of their last meeting. Finchley clears his throat, a soft, polite sound that cuts through the silence.\r\n\r\n  SIR DEREK FINCHLEY\r\n  Gentlemen. I have just come from a meeting at the highest level. A strategic reassessment has been made regarding the subject. Operation Minuet has been... concluded.\r\n\r\nClive looks momentarily confused, a schoolboy whose favorite game has been cancelled. Nigel doesn't move. He expected this.\r\n\r\n  SIR DEREK FINCHLEY (CONT'D)\r\n  While the operation's primary objective—the fracturing of the group—has been achieved, recent actions by the primary subject have created an unforeseen complication. It is now the view that the subject no longer represents a cultural nuisance, but a political one.\r\n\r\nHe slides a single, unsigned sheet of paper from his portfolio and places it in the center of the table.\r\n\r\n  SIR DEREK FINCHLEY (CONT'D)\r\n  As such, a new directive has been issued. The subject's file is to be closed. His activities are to be brought to a... final conclusion. The matter is to be permanently retired.\r\n\r\nHe delivers the lines in a flat, pleasant monotone, as if reading a quarterly budget report.\r\n\r\nNigel’s hand trembles slightly. His teacup rattles against the saucer with a sharp, ceramic CLICK.\r\n\r\nClive leans forward, his eyes scanning the memo's euphemisms. His face, which had been confused, slowly transforms. A manic, creative glee dawns in his eyes. He looks up, breathless.\r\n\r\n  CLIVE\r\n  (A hushed, reverent whisper)\r\n  My God. It's the third act.\r\n\r\nHe leaps from his chair and rushes to a dusty chalkboard on the wall, grabbing a piece of chalk.\r\n\r\n  CLIVE (CONT'D)\r\n  (Muttering to himself)\r\n  A permanent resolution... It requires artistry. A performance piece...\r\n\r\nNigel stares at Finchley, his face draining of color.\r\n\r\n  NIGEL\r\n  Sir... I'm not sure I understand the operational parameters.\r\n\r\n  SIR DEREK FINCHLEY\r\n  (Looking him dead in the eye)\r\n  I think you do, Nigel.\r\n\r\nThe word hangs in the air. The ugly, unspoken truth. Nigel swallows hard.\r\n\r\n  NIGEL\r\n  (A whisper)\r\n  This is assassination.\r\n\r\nThe word sounds vulgar and clumsy in the sterile room.\r\n\r\nClive, at the chalkboard, stops sketching. He turns, a wild look in his eye, a piece of chalk held like a conductor's baton.\r\n\r\n  CLIVE\r\n  Don't be so pedestrian, Nigel! It's not an assassination, it's a... a composition! A public performance that concludes with a private solution! I call it... The Pigeon Gambit!\r\n\r\nHe gestures grandly to the chalkboard, which is now covered in a frantic scrawl of arrows and stick figures.\r\n\r\n  CLIVE (CONT'D)\r\n  The target, Lennon, is scheduled to perform at a UNICEF charity concert. The irony is sublime! He delivers himself to us. Phase One: our asset in the lighting crew creates an 'Ono Obfuscation'—a single, isolating spotlight on the wife. The crowd is distracted. Phase Two...\r\n\r\nNigel stares at him, horrified. He turns back to Finchley, pleading.\r\n\r\n  NIGEL\r\n  Sir Derek. This is... madness. It's not what we do. We are an intelligence service, not...\r\n\r\n  SIR DEREK FINCHLEY\r\n  (Interrupting smoothly)\r\n  We are servants of the Crown, Mr. Finch. And we do what is required.\r\n\r\n  NIGEL\r\n  But a public concert... the variables are astronomical. An air rifle from the rafters? The wind from the ventilation alone... It's too complex. It's unprofessional.\r\n\r\nHe's latched onto his only possible defense: not morality, but pragmatism.\r\n\r\n  NIGEL (CONT'D)\r\n  If a job must be done, it must be done simply. A car accident. A faulty gas heater. These are the classics for a reason. They are... tidy.\r\n\r\nClive looks personally offended, as if Nigel has just insulted his life's work.\r\n\r\n  CLIVE\r\n  Tidy? We are composing an elegy, Nigel, not... tidying the garage! It needs psychological resonance! The Palace expects a masterpiece, not a vulgar street crime!\r\n\r\nFinchley watches the exchange with the detached interest of a scientist observing two different species of insect. He lets the silence hang for a beat, then makes his decision.\r\n\r\n  SIR DEREK FINCHLEY\r\n  (To Clive)\r\n  Your methodology is... certainly creative.\r\n  (To Nigel)\r\n  And your caution is noted, as always.\r\n\r\nHe stands, straightening his perfectly tailored suit jacket. The briefing is over.\r\n\r\n  SIR DEREK FINCHLEY (CONT'D)\r\n  I expect a preliminary plan on my desk by Monday.\r\n  (He looks at Clive, a hint of a smile)\r\n  Something... memorable.\r\n\r\nHe gives a polite, almost imperceptible nod and exits, closing the door behind him with a soft, final CLICK. He has left no fingerprints.\r\n\r\nClive immediately turns back to the chalkboard, a man possessed by his muse, sketching frantically.\r\n\r\nNigel sits alone at the table. He stares at his cold cup of tea. He is a man trapped between his duty, his pension, and a conscience he never knew he had. The quiet, bureaucratic melancholy he has carried for years has curdled into pure dread.\r\n\r\nSCENE END\r\n```","src/content/scenes/act-3/s26-the-pigeon-gambit.md","2cf4a64876c6c033",{html:1164,metadata:1165},"<pre class=\"astro-code github-dark\" style=\"background-color:#24292e;color:#e1e4e8; overflow-x: auto;\" tabindex=\"0\" data-language=\"text\"><code><span class=\"line\"><span>SCENE START</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>INT.

CONCERT HALL - DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT (MARCH 1970)\r\n\r\nA small, cluttered room, warm and organic. Clothes are strewn over chairs. A half-eaten plate of sandwiches sits on a table.\r\n\r\nJOHN LENNON (30) paces nervously, tuning his acoustic guitar. He wears simple white clothes, looking vulnerable without the armor of The Beatles.\r\n\r\nYOKO ONO (37), a picture of serenity in matching white, sits perfectly still, watching him.\r\n\r\n  JOHN\r\n  It feels strange. Doing this without the others. Like I've forgotten how to stand on my own.\r\n\r\n  YOKO\r\n  (Softly)\r\n  You are not on your own. You have me. And you have the song. The rest is just... noise.\r\n\r\nJohn stops pacing. He looks at her and manages a small, nervous smile.\r\n\r\nINT. CONCERT HALL - RAFTERS - CONTINUOUS\r\n\r\nFramed in a cold, symmetrical wide shot. The darkness is absolute, save for a single, low-wattage work light creating a cage of geometric shadows from the steel beams.\r\n\r\nCLIVE BARROW (46) lies prone on a dusty catwalk. Beside him, ARTHUR JENKINS (52), the Operative, meticulously tries to secure the antique Anschütz rifle to a railing. Arthur’s movements are precise and economical; Clive’s are twitchy with excitement.\r\n\r\n  ARTHUR\r\n  (Quietly, reporting a fact)\r\n  The bracket's not flush. There's a wobble.\r\n\r\n  CLIVE\r\n  (Hissing)\r\n  Compensate! An artist works with his materials, Arthur. Now, have you acquired the mark?\r\n\r\nArthur sighs, a tiny, almost inaudible puff of air. He squints through the foggy 1930s telescopic sight.\r\n\r\n  ARTHUR\r\n  Negative. The optics are clouded. It's like looking through a milk bottle.\r\n\r\nClive closes his eyes for a second, a man willing his masterpiece into existence through sheer force of will.\r\n\r\nINT. CONCERT HALL - LIGHTING BOOTH - CONTINUOUS\r\n\r\nThe sterile, humming heart of the theatre's machinery. Banks of levers and dials are arranged with military precision.\r\n\r\nNIGEL FINCH (53), dressed as a stagehand, stands at the main lighting board, calmly sipping from a thermos of tea.\r\n\r\nHe gives a slow, deliberate nod to a terrified-looking ASSET (20s) at a smaller, secondary board. The Asset swallows hard and nods back, his hands trembling.\r\n\r\nINT. CONCERT HALL - STAGE - CONTINUOUS\r\n\r\nThe stage is dark. A single microphone stands in a pool of soft, blue light. The vast, expectant silence of the packed hall is a physical presence.\r\n\r\n  ANNOUNCER (V.O.)\r\n  Ladies and gentlemen, a man who needs no introduction... John Lennon!\r\n\r\nA roar from the CROWD.\r\n\r\nJohn and Yoko walk out from the wings, hand in hand, looking small on the vast stage. They approach the microphone. John positions his guitar. Yoko stands slightly behind him, a silent, supportive presence.\r\n\r\nThe applause dies down. John leans into the microphone.\r\n\r\n  JOHN\r\n  (His voice echoing slightly)\r\n  This is for peace.\r\n\r\nHe begins the gentle, instantly recognizable opening chords of \"Instant Karma!\"\r\n\r\nINT. CONCERT HALL - RAFTERS - CONTINUOUS\r\n\r\nClive's eyes are wide. This is it. The overture.\r\n\r\n  CLIVE\r\n  (Into a walkie-talkie)\r\n  Stand by for the Ono Obfuscation. Phase One is imminent.\r\n\r\nArthur struggles to keep the blurry silhouette of John's head in his sights.\r\n\r\n  ARTHUR\r\n  Target is mobile. I don't have a clean shot.\r\n\r\n  CLIVE\r\n  Patience, Arthur. The art will provide.\r\n\r\nINT. CONCERT HALL - LIGHTING BOOTH - CONTINUOUS\r\n\r\nNigel calmly puts the cap back on his thermos. He looks at the terrified Asset.\r\n\r\n  NIGEL\r\n  (Quietly)\r\n  On my mark.\r\n\r\nThe Asset's hand hovers over a large, red lever.\r\n\r\nINT. CONCERT HALL - STAGE - CONTINUOUS\r\n\r\nJohn sings, his voice clear and honest.\r\n\r\n  JOHN\r\n  (Singing)\r\n  \"Instant Karma's gonna get you... Gonna knock you right on the head...\"\r\n\r\nINT. CONCERT HALL - RAFTERS - CONTINUOUS\r\n\r\n  CLIVE\r\n  (Hissing into the radio)\r\n  Execute! Execute the Obfuscation!\r\n\r\nINT. CONCERT HALL - LIGHTING BOOTH - CONTINUOUS\r\n\r\nNigel gives the Asset a single, curt nod.\r\n\r\n  NIGEL\r\n  Now.\r\n\r\nThe Asset yanks the lever down with all his might.\r\n\r\nINT. CONCERT HALL - STAGE - CONTINUOUS\r\n\r\nIt is not a single spotlight.\r\n\r\nIt is a biblical flood of pure, white light. EVERY SINGLE STAGE LIGHT—hundreds of them—slams on at maximum intensity.\r\n\r\nThe stage disappears into an overexposed, blinding white void.\r\n\r\nThe CROWD GASPS, shielding their eyes.\r\n\r\nJohn stumbles back from the microphone, blinded, his song faltering.\r\n\r\nINT. CONCERT HALL - RAFTERS - CONTINUOUS\r\n\r\nThe glare reflects off Arthur's scope, blinding him.\r\n\r\n  ARTHUR\r\n  Christ! Negative visibility! It's a total washout!\r\n\r\nClive stares in horror. This is not his subtle, artistic vision. This is a train wreck.\r\n\r\n  CLIVE\r\n  (Screaming into his radio)\r\n  What is happening?! The subtlety! Where is the bloody subtlety?!\r\n\r\nINT. CONCERT HALL - LIGHTING BOOTH - CONTINUOUS\r\n\r\nNigel watches the chaos unfold, his face a perfect mask of bureaucratic indifference. He takes another slow sip of tea.\r\n\r\nINT. CONCERT HALL - STAGE - CONTINUOUS\r\n\r\nYoko Ono does not see a technical fault. She sees a canvas.\r\n\r\nShe steps forward into the center of the blinding white void, a tiny silhouette against the glare. She takes the microphone from its stand.\r\n\r\nAnd she lets out a single, piercing, primal SCREAM.\r\n\r\nIt's a sound that rips through the hall, a bolt of pure, avant-garde energy. It is not a scream of fear. It is a scream of art.\r\n\r\nThe audience is stunned into absolute silence. A few people in the front, thinking this is part of the show, begin to applaud uncertainly.\r\n\r\nINT. CONCERT HALL - RAFTERS - CONTINUOUS\r\n\r\nYoko's shriek cuts through Arthur's professional composure. He flinches violently. An involuntary, human reaction to an inhuman sound.\r\n\r\nHis finger jerks on the trigger.\r\n\r\nThe antique rifle FIRES with a quiet *PFFT*.\r\n\r\nThe shot goes wild. It misses the stage entirely, zipping through the darkness and hitting the giant \"UNICEF: CONCERT FOR PEACE\" banner hanging high above.\r\n\r\nThe bullet tears through the fabric. The \"C\" in \"PEACE\" rips and flaps down, dangling by a thread.\r\n\r\nThe message now reads: PEA E.\r\n\r\nClive stares at the ruined banner. His masterpiece. His elegy. It's a joke. It's a typo.\r\n\r\n  CLIVE\r\n  (A choked whisper into his radio)\r\n  The Pigeon has flown the coop... Abort. Abort the composition.\r\n\r\nINT. CONCERT HALL - STAGE - CONTINUOUS\r\n\r\nThe blinding lights suddenly cut out, plunging the stage back into a single, soft spotlight.\r\n\r\nJohn, recovering his composure, steps back to the microphone. He has no idea what just happened. He thinks it was just... rock and roll.\r\n\r\nHe finishes the final chords of the song.\r\n\r\nThe audience, utterly bewildered by the lights, the scream, and the broken banner, erupts into confused but thunderous applause.\r\n\r\nJohn and Yoko take a bow, hand in hand, and walk off stage. They are alive. They are oblivious.\r\n\r\nINT. CONCERT HALL - BACKSTAGE - CONTINUOUS\r\n\r\nNigel calmly places his thermos back in his satchel. He gives a final, blank look toward the stage, then turns and walks away, melting into the chaos of the backstage crew.\r\n\r\nHis face is a portrait of profound, soul-crushing relief. He did his job. He followed his orders. And he saved a man's life with too much light.\r\n\r\nSCENE END\r\n```","src/content/scenes/act-3/s29-instant-karma.md","73246862483511ce",{html:1288,metadata:1289},"<pre class=\"astro-code github-dark\" style=\"background-color:#24292e;color:#e1e4e8; overflow-x: auto;\" tabindex=\"0\" data-language=\"text\"><code><span class=\"line\"><span>SCENE START</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>INT.

Thrives in woodland edges, scrubland, and agricultural areas.\r\n* **Interesting Facts:** The male (cock) is brightly colored with a long tail, while the female (hen) is mottled brown for camouflage. They are poor flyers, preferring to run, but can burst into short, fast flight when startled.\r\n* **Conservation Status (IUCN):** Least Concern. Their populations are heavily managed and supplemented by breeding programs for sport shooting.\r\n\r\n### **Partridge**\r\n\r\n* **Habitat:** Ground-dwelling birds found across Europe, Asia, and Africa. Prefers grasslands, farmland, and open scrub. The Grey Partridge is a common UK species.\r\n* **Interesting Facts:** Partridges form a social group called a \"covey.\" They are known for their explosive, whirring flight when flushed from cover.\r\n* **Conservation Status (IUCN):** The Grey Partridge is listed as Near Threatened in some regions due to agricultural intensification, but the overall species group is generally Least Concern.\r\n\r\n### **Red Grouse**\r\n\r\n* **Habitat:** A subspecies of the Willow Ptarmigan, found exclusively in the upland heather moorlands of Great Britain and Ireland.\r\n* **Interesting Facts:** Its diet consists almost entirely of the shoots, seeds, and flowers of heather. Its population numbers can fluctuate dramatically in natural cycles.\r\n* **Conservation Status (IUCN):** Listed as a species of conservation concern in the UK (Amber List) due to habitat loss and population declines.\r\n\r\n### **Red Deer**\r\n\r\n* **Habitat:** Native across most of Europe, parts of Asia, and North Africa. Inhabits woodland, moorland, and mountains.\r\n* **Interesting Facts:** It is one of the largest deer species. The male is called a \"stag\" and grows large, branching antlers which are shed each year. The \"rut\" is their dramatic autumn mating season, known for the stags' loud roaring.\r\n* **Conservation Status (IUCN):** Least Concern.\r\n\r\n### **Wild Boar**\r\n\r\n* **Habitat:** Native to much of Eurasia and North Africa. Highly adaptable, living in woodlands, reed beds, and farmland.\r\n* **Interesting Facts:** They are the wild ancestor of the domestic pig. They are omnivorous and use their powerful snouts for rooting in the soil for food. They can be aggressive if threatened.\r\n* **Conservation Status (IUCN):** Least Concern.\r\n\r\n### **Tiger**\r\n\r\n* **Habitat:** Found in fragmented populations across Asia, from India to Siberia. Inhabits forests, grasslands, and mangrove swamps.\r\n* **Interesting Facts:** The tiger is the largest cat species in the world. Each tiger has a unique stripe pattern, similar to a human fingerprint.\r\n* **Conservation Status (IUCN):** Endangered. Its population has been decimated by poaching and habitat loss.\r\n\r\n### **Crocodile**\r\n\r\n* **Habitat:** The Nile Crocodile, likely the species hunted in The Gambia, is found throughout freshwater habitats in sub-Saharan Africa.\r\n* **Interesting Facts:** They are apex \"ambush predators,\" waiting for hours or days for suitable prey to come near. They have one of the most powerful bites in the animal kingdom.\r\n* **Conservation Status (IUCN):** Least Concern. Once threatened, conservation efforts have been very successful.\r\n\r\n### **Marco Polo Sheep**\r\n\r\n* **Habitat:** A subspecies of the Argali sheep, native to the high-altitude Pamir Mountains of Central Asia.\r\n* **Interesting Facts:** Named after Marco Polo, who described them in his travels. They are famous for having the longest horns of any sheep species, with a mature ram's horns sometimes spanning over 6 feet.\r\n* **Conservation Status (IUCN):** Near Threatened, due to poaching and competition with domestic livestock.\r\n\r\n### **Quail**\r\n\r\n* **Habitat:** Small, migratory game birds. The Common Quail is found across Europe, Asia, and Africa, favoring farmland and grassland.\r\n* **Interesting Facts:** They are notoriously difficult to see, preferring to creep through vegetation. Their call, often described as a \"wet-my-lips\" sound, is more frequently heard than the bird is seen.\r\n* **Conservation Status (IUCN):** Least Concern.\r\n\r\n### **Wild Duck**\r\n\r\n* **Habitat:** This broad category often refers to the Mallard, the most common and widespread duck in the Northern Hemisphere. Found in any wetland habitat.\r\n* **Interesting Facts:** The male Mallard has a distinctive iridescent green head. They are \"dabbling ducks,\" feeding by tipping their bodies forward into the water rather than diving completely.\r\n* **Conservation Status (IUCN):** Least Concern.\r\n\r\n### **Snipe**\r\n\r\n* **Habitat:** Wading birds with very long, slender bills. The Common Snipe is found in marshes, bogs, and wet meadows across the Northern Hemisphere.\r\n* **Interesting Facts:** They are famous for their \"winnowing\" or \"drumming\" display flight. During this display, the male dives through the air, and the vibration of his outer tail feathers creates a unique, haunting sound.\r\n* **Conservation Status (IUCN):** Least Concern.\r\n\r\n### **Pigeon**\r\n\r\n* **Habitat:** The primary quarry for sport is the Wood Pigeon, found in woodland, parks, and farmland across Europe. The Feral Pigeon (or Rock Dove) is found in urban areas worldwide.\r\n* **Interesting Facts:** Wood Pigeons are larger than feral pigeons and are known for their cooing call and the white patches on their neck and wings. They can be significant agricultural pests.\r\n* **Conservation Status (IUCN):** Least Concern.\r\n\r\n### **Rabbit**\r\n\r\n* **Habitat:** The European Rabbit is native to the Iberian Peninsula but introduced globally. Prefers dry grassland and scrub, living in complex burrow systems called warrens.\r\n* **Interesting Facts:** Known for an extremely high reproductive rate. They are a keystone species in their native habitat but a destructive invasive pest elsewhere (e.g., Australia).\r\n* **Conservation Status (IUCN):** Endangered in its native range (Spain and Portugal) but Least Concern globally.\r\n\r\n### **Puffin**\r\n\r\n* **Habitat:** The Atlantic Puffin is a seabird that spends most of its life at sea, breeding in large colonies on coastal cliffs and islands in the North Atlantic.\r\n* **Interesting Facts:** Nicknamed \"sea parrots\" for their brightly colored beaks in the breeding season. They can carry multiple small fish back to their chicks by holding them crosswise in their bill.\r\n* **Conservation Status (IUCN):** Vulnerable, due to threats including overfishing of their food sources.\r\n\r\n### **Woodcock**\r\n\r\n* **Habitat:** A wading bird found in damp woodlands across Europe and Asia. They are largely nocturnal or crepuscular (active at dawn and dusk).\r\n* **Interesting Facts:** They have exceptional 360-degree vision due to the placement of their eyes high on the sides of their heads. Their camouflage is among the most effective of any bird.\r\n* **Conservation Status (IUCN):** Least Concern.\r\n\r\n### **Roe Deer**\r\n\r\n* **Habitat:** Native to Europe and Asia, this small deer is highly adaptable, living in woodland, farmland, and even suburban gardens. A male is a \"roebuck.\"\r\n* **Interesting Facts:** Unlike most deer, they are generally solitary or live in small family groups. They are known for their loud, dog-like barking call when alarmed.\r\n* **Conservation Status (IUCN):** Least Concern.\r\n\r\n### **Spanish Ibex**\r\n\r\n* **Habitat:** A species of wild goat endemic to the mountainous regions of the Iberian Peninsula (Spain and Portugal).\r\n* **Interesting Facts:** Known for their large, ridged, backward-curving horns. They are incredibly agile climbers. Two subspecies have gone extinct in recent history, but the overall population has recovered well.\r\n* **Conservation Status (IUCN):** Least Concern, following successful conservation efforts.","src/content/research/animal-reference.mdx","c0f7bc11f7835322","animal-reference.mdx","beatles-mbe-jesus-quote-gap",{id:1422,data:1424,body:1438,filePath:1439,digest:1440,rendered:1441,legacyId:1484},{title:1425,category:1426,date_range:1427,reliability:1408,relevance:1428,tags:1429,created:1437},"John Lennon's Jesus Comment: Context, Fallout, and the Road to Backlash","character_research","October 1965 – March 1966","Outlines the Beatles’ activities between receiving their MBEs and the publication of Lennon's 'more popular than Jesus' remark, while analyzing American public sentiment in the months leading to the controversy.",[1430,1431,1432,1433,1434,1435,1436],"John Lennon","The Beatles","religion","controversy","Rubber Soul","1960s America","Maureen Cleave",["Date","2025-07-28T00:00:00.000Z"],"## **What the Beatles Were Doing Between the MBE and the Jesus Comment**\r\n\r\n### 🏅 **October 1965: Honored by the Queen**\r\n\r\n- **Oct 26, 1965:** The Beatles receive their MBEs from Queen Elizabeth II at Buckingham Palace.\r\n  - The event is celebrated by fans and tabloids, though some British veterans return their medals in protest.\r\n  - It solidifies the Beatles' status not just as entertainers but as cultural icons.\r\n\r\n### 🎛️ **November 1965: Recording *Rubber Soul***\r\n\r\n- **Nov 3–11:** The Beatles work intensely in EMI Studios on their sixth album, *Rubber Soul*.\r\n- George experiments with the sitar on “Norwegian Wood.”\r\n- Lennon’s songwriting becomes more introspective and surreal, setting the tone for the band’s evolution into deeper lyrical and musical territory.\r\n\r\n### 📺 **December 1965: Album Release and Media**\r\n\r\n- **Dec 3, 1965:** *Rubber Soul* is released in the UK and the U.S. to critical and commercial acclaim.\r\n  - It debuts at No. 1 in both countries.\r\n  - Marked a turning point where rock music began being treated as serious art.\r\n- Beatles participate in year-end media events and the Shea Stadium concert special is prepared for TV.\r\n\r\n### 🛌 **January–February 1966: Private Lives and Growing Restlessness**\r\n\r\n- The Beatles enjoy a rare period of personal time:\r\n  - **Lennon** retreats into books, especially on religion and philosophy.\r\n  - **McCartney** begins scoring *The Family Way*.\r\n  - **Harrison** deepens his interest in Indian music and culture.\r\n  - **Starr** focuses on family life.\r\n- Lennon increasingly voices frustration with fame and meaninglessness in private conversations.\r\n\r\n### 🗞️ **March 4, 1966: The Cleave Interview Is Published**\r\n\r\n- Maureen Cleave’s profile of Lennon appears in the *London Evening Standard*.\r\n- Highlights from the article:\r\n  - Lennon remarks, *“We’re more popular than Jesus now.”*\r\n  - He expresses a fascination with religion, boredom with fame, and an increasing desire to understand the world’s big questions.\r\n  - He’s portrayed as intellectual, isolated, and restless.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## **American Public Sentiment in Early 1966**\r\n\r\n### ✅ **Still Hugely Popular**\r\n\r\n- The Beatles remained dominant in the U.S. music scene.\r\n- *Rubber Soul* was praised for its maturity and innovation.\r\n- Their 1965 Shea Stadium concert had set attendance records and won admiration across generations.\r\n\r\n### ⚠️ **Cracks in the Foundation**\r\n\r\n- By early 1966, conservative Americans were starting to grow uneasy:\r\n  - The Beatles’ image was shifting from lovable mop-tops to opinionated, artistic thinkers.\r\n  - Their increasingly candid public statements (on drugs, politics, religion) made them lightning rods for controversy.\r\n- No full-blown backlash had occurred—**but the stage was set.**\r\n\r\n### ⏳ **The Calm Before the Storm**\r\n\r\n- Though Lennon’s \"Jesus\" quote made little noise in Britain upon publication, the cultural gap between British secularism and American religiosity meant it would explode once reprinted in the U.S. four months later.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## **In Summary**\r\n\r\nBetween October 1965 and March 1966, the Beatles:\r\n\r\n1.

Working for the *London Evening Standard*, she stood out from the teen-focused press by treating pop music, and The Beatles in particular, as a serious cultural phenomenon.\r\n\r\n* **Early Access:** She began interviewing The Beatles in 1963, before the full explosion of global Beatlemania. This early relationship fostered a level of trust and familiarity that allowed for unusually candid interviews. The band, especially John, saw her as an intellectual peer, not just another reporter.\r\n* **\"How a Beatle Lives\" Series (1966):** The infamous interview was part of a series of four in-depth profiles Cleave wrote, one for each Beatle, intended to show the men behind the myth. This format was designed for thoughtful character study, not sensationalism. She visited each of them in their homes, observing their domestic lives and engaging in long, philosophical conversations.\r\n\r\n## 2. Journalistic Style and Philosophy\r\n\r\nCleave's style was the antithesis of the tabloid press. She was known for:\r\n\r\n* **Intellectual Curiosity:** A graduate of Oxford University, she approached her subjects with genuine intellectual rigor. She was more interested in their thoughts, influences, and anxieties than in their romantic lives or celebrity gossip.\r\n* **Perceptive Observation:** Her profiles are rich with detail that reveals character. She noticed the books on John's shelves, the melancholy behind Ringo's humor, and the ambition driving Paul.\r\n* **Nuanced Context:** She understood that her subjects were complex. Her profile of John doesn't present him as an arrogant blasphemer, but as a restless, intelligent, and slightly bored young man trapped in a \"gilded cage,\" searching for meaning beyond material wealth.\r\n\r\n## 3. Inferred Political and Social Views (c. 1966)\r\n\r\nMaureen Cleave was not a political journalist and did not publicly broadcast overt political affiliations. However, her views can be inferred from her work and her position within the cultural milieu of \"Swinging London.\"\r\n\r\n* **Socially Liberal & Progressive:** Her writing reflects a modern, forward-thinking perspective. She was part of a generation questioning traditional British class structures, religious dogma, and social mores. She took the \"youthquake\" seriously as a force for social change.\r\n* **Secular Worldview:** For Cleave and her readership at the *Evening Standard*, a comment about the decline of institutional Christianity in Britain would have been seen as a common, almost banal observation, not a shocking heresy. Britain in the mid-60s was a far more secular society than the United States, especially the American South. This cultural gap is central to the controversy.\r\n* **Anti-Establishment, but not Radical:** Her perspective was that of an educated cultural commentator, skeptical of the old guard but not a revolutionary. She was documenting the counter-culture more as an insightful observer than as an active participant in its more radical political fringes.\r\n\r\n## 4. The 1966 Lennon Interview: Context and Aftermath\r\n\r\n* **The Original Context:** The interview at Kenwood was a relaxed, rambling conversation. John's comment was part of a wider point about the fading influence of the Church of England among young people. Within the full article, it was a thoughtful, if provocative, remark made by a man grappling with the absurdity of his own fame. In the UK, it caused virtually no stir upon its publication in March 1966.\r\n* **The Weaponization:** The quote was lifted out of context five months later by the American teen magazine *Datebook* and plastered on its cover. This act transformed a sociological observation into a defiant boast.\r\n* **Cleave's Reaction:** By all accounts, Cleave was dismayed by the American reaction. She had written a nuanced portrait, only to see one sentence twisted into a weapon that endangered the band. It was a stark lesson in how responsible journalism could be distorted when it crossed cultural and commercial lines.\r\n\r\n## 5. Narrative Significance for the Screenplay\r\n\r\nMaureen Cleave is not just a plot device; she is a crucial thematic character.\r\n\r\n* **The Unwitting Catalyst:** She provides the spark that the conspiracy (MI5/The Committee) will fan into a wildfire. Her journalistic integrity makes her actions blameless, which is essential for the plot's believability.\r\n* **Embodiment of Nuance:** She represents the original, intended meaning of Lennon's words. Her character allows the audience to understand what John *actually* meant before seeing how those words are deliberately misinterpreted and amplified.\r\n* **The Perfect Cover:** The controversy she accidentally starts is so loud and culturally resonant that it provides the perfect distraction. No one, including Cleave herself, would ever think to look for a deeper, political manipulation behind what appears to be a straightforward culture-war firestorm. She represents the \"truth\" of the situation, which paradoxically makes her the ideal unwitting accomplice to the conspiracy's lie.","src/content/research/cleave-career-and-context.md","b3bec90e4ddbf27b",{html:1502,metadata:1503},"<h2 id=\"1-career-and-relationship-with-the-beatles\">1.

Ever since then, observers have anxiously tried to gauge whether their fame was on the wax or on the wane; they foretold the fall of the old Beatles, they searched diligently for the new Beatles (which was as pointless as looking for the new Big Ben).\r\n\r\nAt last they have given up; The Beatles' fame is beyond question. It has nothing to do with whether they are rude or polite, married or unmarried, 25 or 45; whether they appear on Top of the Pops or do not appear on Top of the Pops. They are well above any position even a Rolling Stone might jostle for. They are famous in the way the Queen is famous. When John Lennon's Rolls-Royce, with its black wheels and its black windows, goes past, people say: 'It's the Queen,' or 'It's The Beatles.' With her they share the security of a stable life at the top. They all tick over in the public esteem-she in Buckingham Palace, they in the Weybridge-Esher area. Only Paul remains in London.\r\n\r\nThe Weybridge community consists of the three married Beatles; they live there among the wooded hills and the stockbrokers. They have not worked since Christmas and their existence is secluded and curiously timeless. \"What day is it?\" John Lennon asks with interest when you ring up with news from outside. The fans are still at the gates but The Beatles see only each other. They are better friends than ever before.\r\n\r\nRingo and his wife, Maureen, may drop in on John and Cyn; John may drop in on Ringo; George and Pattie may drop in on John and Cyn and they might all go round to Ringo's, by car of course. Outdoors is for holidays.\r\n\r\nThey watch films, they play rowdy games of Buccaneer; they watch television till it goes off, often playing records at the same time. They while away the small hours of the morning making mad tapes. Bedtimes and mealtimes have no meaning as such. \"We've never had time before to do anything but just be Beatles,\" John Lennon said.\r\n\r\nHe is much the same as he was before. He still peers down his nose, arrogant as an eagle, although contact lenses have righted the short sight that originally caused the expression. He looks more like Henry VIII than ever now that his face has filled out-he is just as imperious, just as unpredictable, indolent, disorganised, childish, vague, charming and quick-witted. He is still easy-going, still tough as hell. \"You never asked after Fred Lennon,\" he said, disappointed. (Fred is his father; he emerged after they got famous.) \"He was here a few weeks ago. It was only the second time in my life I'd seen him -- I showed him the door.\" He went on cheerfully: \"I wasn't having him in the house.\"\r\n\r\nHis enthusiasm is undiminished and he insists on its being shared. George has put him on to this Indian music. \"You're not listening, are you?\" he shouts after 20 minutes of the record. \"It's amazing this -- so cool. Don't the Indians appear cool to you? Are you listening? This music is thousands of years old; it makes me laugh, the British going over there and telling them what to do. Quite amazing.\" And he switched on the television set.\r\n\r\nExperience has sown few seeds of doubt in him: not that his mind is closed, but it's closed round whatever he believes at the time. \"Christianity will go,\" he said. \"It will vanish and shrink. I needn't argue about that; I'm right and I will be proved right. We're more popular than Jesus now; I don't know which will go first -- rock 'n' roll or Christianity. Jesus was all right but his disciples were thick and ordinary. It's them twisting it that ruins it for me.\" He is reading extensively about religion.\r\n\r\nHe shops in lightning swoops on Asprey's these days and there is some fine wine in his cellar, but he is still quite unselfconscious. He is far too lazy to keep up appearances, even if he had worked out what the appearances should be-which he has not.\r\n\r\nHe is now 25. He lives in a large, heavily panelled, heavily carpeted, mock Tudor house set on a hill with his wife Cynthia and his son Julian. There is a cat called after his aunt Mimi, and a purple dining room. Julian is three; he may be sent to the Lycde in London. \"Seems the only place for him in his position,\" said his father, surveying him dispassionately. \"I feel sorry for him, though. I couldn't stand ugly people even when I was five. Lots of the ugly ones are foreign, aren't they?\"\r\n\r\nWe did a speedy tour of the house, Julian panting along behind, clutching a large porcelain Siamese cat. John swept past the objects in which he had lost interest: \"That's Sidney\" (a suit of armour); \"That's a hobby I had for a week\" (a room full of model racing cars); \"Cyn won't let me get rid of that\" (a fruit machine). In the sitting room are eight little green boxes with winking red lights; he bought them as Christmas presents but never got round to giving them away. They wink for a year; one imagines him sitting there till next Christmas, surrounded by the little winking boxes.\r\n\r\nHe paused over objects he still fancies; a huge altar crucifix of a Roman Catholic nature with IHS on it; a pair of crutches, a present from George; an enormous Bible he bought in Chester; his gorilla suit.\r\n\r\n\"I thought I might need a gorilla suit,\" he said; he seemed sad about it. \"I've only worn it twice. I thought I might pop it on in the summer and drive round in the Ferrari. We were all going to get them and drive round in them but I was the only one who did. I've been thinking about it and if I didn't wear the head it would make an amazing fur coat-with legs, you see. I would like a fur coat but I've never run into any.\"\r\n\r\nOne feels that his possessions -- to which he adds daily-have got the upper hand; all the tape recorders, the five television sets, the cars, the telephones of which he knows not a single number. The moment he approaches a switch it fuses; six of the winking boxes, guaranteed to last till next Christmas, have gone funny already. His cars-the Rolls, the Mini-Cooper (black wheels, black windows), the Ferrari (being painted black) -- puzzle him. Then there's the swimming pool, the trees sloping away beneath it. \"Nothing like what I ordered,\" he said resignedly. He wanted the bottom to be a mirror. \"It's an amazing household,\" he said. \"None of my gadgets really work except the gorilla suit -- that's the only suit that fits me.\"\r\n\r\nHe is very keen on books, will always ask what is good to read. He buys quantities of books and these are kept tidily in a special room. He has Swift, Tennyson, Huxley, Orwell, costly leather-bound editions of Tolstoy, Oscar Wilde. Then there's Little Women, all the William books from his childhood; and some unexpected volumes such as Forty-One Years In India, by Field Marshal Lord Roberts, and Curiosities of Natural History, by Francis T. Buckland. This last-with its chapter headings 'Ear-less Cats', 'Wooden-Legged People,' 'The Immortal Harvey's Mother' is right up his street.\r\n\r\nHe approaches reading with a lively interest untempered by too much formal education. \"I've read millions of books,\" he said, \"that's why I seem to know things.\" He is obsessed by Celts. \"I have decided I am a Celt,\" he said. \"I am on Boadicea's side -- all those bloody blue-eyed blondes chopping people up. I have an awful feeling wishing I was there -- not there with scabs and sores but there through reading about it. The books don't give you more than a paragraph about how they lived; I have to imagine that.\"\r\n\r\nHe can sleep almost indefinitely, is probably the laziest person in England. \"Physically lazy,\" he said. \"I don't mind writing or reading or watching or speaking, but sex is the only physical thing I can be bothered with any more.\" Occasionally he is driven to London in the Rolls by an ex-Welsh guardsman called Anthony; Anthony has a moustache that intrigues him.\r\n\r\nThe day I visited him he had been invited to lunch in London, about which he was rather excited. \"Do you know how long lunch lasts?\" he asked. \"I've never been to lunch before.

The waiters kept looking and saying: 'No, it isn't him, it can't be him'.\"\r\n\r\nHe settled himself into the car and demonstrated the television, the folding bed, the refrigerator, the writing desk, the telephone. He has spent many fruitless hours on that telephone. \"I only once got through to a person,\" he said, \"and they were out.\"\r\n\r\nAnthony had spent the weekend in Wales.

If you have money, that's power without having to be powerful. I often think that it's all a big conspiracy, that the winners are the Government and people like us who've got the money. That joke about keeping the workers ignorant is still true; that's what they said about the Tories and the landowners and that; then Labour were meant to educate the workers but they don't seem to be doing that any more.\"\r\n\r\nHe has a morbid horror of stupid people: \"Famous and loaded as I am, I still have to meet soft people. It often comes into my mind that I'm not really rich. There are really rich people but I don't know where they are.\"\r\n\r\nHe finds being famous quite easy, confirming one's suspicion that The Beatles had been leading up to this all their lives. \"Everybody thinks they would have been famous if only they'd had the Latin and that. So when it happens it comes naturally. You remember your old grannie saying soft things like: 'You'll make it with that voice.'\" Not, he added, that he had any old grannies.\r\n\r\nHe got to the doctor 2 3/4 hours early and to lunch on time but in the wrong place. He bought a giant compendium of games from Asprey's but having opened it he could not, of course, shut it again. He wondered what else he should buy. He went to Brian Epstein's office. \"Any presents?\" he asked eagerly; he observed that there was nothing like getting things free.

Ever since then, observers have anxiously tried to gauge whether their fame was on the wax or on the wane; they foretold the fall of the old Beatles, they searched diligently for the new Beatles (which was as pointless as looking for the new Big Ben).</p>\n<p>At last they have given up; The Beatles’ fame is beyond question. It has nothing to do with whether they are rude or polite, married or unmarried, 25 or 45; whether they appear on Top of the Pops or do not appear on Top of the Pops. They are well above any position even a Rolling Stone might jostle for. They are famous in the way the Queen is famous. When John Lennon’s Rolls-Royce, with its black wheels and its black windows, goes past, people say: ‘It’s the Queen,’ or ‘It’s The Beatles.’ With her they share the security of a stable life at the top. They all tick over in the public esteem-she in Buckingham Palace, they in the Weybridge-Esher area. Only Paul remains in London.</p>\n<p>The Weybridge community consists of the three married Beatles; they live there among the wooded hills and the stockbrokers. They have not worked since Christmas and their existence is secluded and curiously timeless. “What day is it?” John Lennon asks with interest when you ring up with news from outside. The fans are still at the gates but The Beatles see only each other. They are better friends than ever before.</p>\n<p>Ringo and his wife, Maureen, may drop in on John and Cyn; John may drop in on Ringo; George and Pattie may drop in on John and Cyn and they might all go round to Ringo’s, by car of course. Outdoors is for holidays.</p>\n<p>They watch films, they play rowdy games of Buccaneer; they watch television till it goes off, often playing records at the same time. They while away the small hours of the morning making mad tapes. Bedtimes and mealtimes have no meaning as such. “We’ve never had time before to do anything but just be Beatles,” John Lennon said.</p>\n<p>He is much the same as he was before. He still peers down his nose, arrogant as an eagle, although contact lenses have righted the short sight that originally caused the expression. He looks more like Henry VIII than ever now that his face has filled out-he is just as imperious, just as unpredictable, indolent, disorganised, childish, vague, charming and quick-witted. He is still easy-going, still tough as hell. “You never asked after Fred Lennon,” he said, disappointed. (Fred is his father; he emerged after they got famous.) “He was here a few weeks ago. It was only the second time in my life I’d seen him — I showed him the door.” He went on cheerfully: “I wasn’t having him in the house.”</p>\n<p>His enthusiasm is undiminished and he insists on its being shared. George has put him on to this Indian music. “You’re not listening, are you?” he shouts after 20 minutes of the record. “It’s amazing this — so cool. Don’t the Indians appear cool to you? Are you listening? This music is thousands of years old; it makes me laugh, the British going over there and telling them what to do. Quite amazing.” And he switched on the television set.</p>\n<p>Experience has sown few seeds of doubt in him: not that his mind is closed, but it’s closed round whatever he believes at the time. “Christianity will go,” he said. “It will vanish and shrink. I needn’t argue about that; I’m right and I will be proved right. We’re more popular than Jesus now; I don’t know which will go first — rock ‘n’ roll or Christianity. Jesus was all right but his disciples were thick and ordinary. It’s them twisting it that ruins it for me.” He is reading extensively about religion.</p>\n<p>He shops in lightning swoops on Asprey’s these days and there is some fine wine in his cellar, but he is still quite unselfconscious. He is far too lazy to keep up appearances, even if he had worked out what the appearances should be-which he has not.</p>\n<p>He is now 25. He lives in a large, heavily panelled, heavily carpeted, mock Tudor house set on a hill with his wife Cynthia and his son Julian. There is a cat called after his aunt Mimi, and a purple dining room. Julian is three; he may be sent to the Lycde in London. “Seems the only place for him in his position,” said his father, surveying him dispassionately. “I feel sorry for him, though. I couldn’t stand ugly people even when I was five. Lots of the ugly ones are foreign, aren’t they?”</p>\n<p>We did a speedy tour of the house, Julian panting along behind, clutching a large porcelain Siamese cat. John swept past the objects in which he had lost interest: “That’s Sidney” (a suit of armour); “That’s a hobby I had for a week” (a room full of model racing cars); “Cyn won’t let me get rid of that” (a fruit machine). In the sitting room are eight little green boxes with winking red lights; he bought them as Christmas presents but never got round to giving them away. They wink for a year; one imagines him sitting there till next Christmas, surrounded by the little winking boxes.</p>\n<p>He paused over objects he still fancies; a huge altar crucifix of a Roman Catholic nature with IHS on it; a pair of crutches, a present from George; an enormous Bible he bought in Chester; his gorilla suit.</p>\n<p>“I thought I might need a gorilla suit,” he said; he seemed sad about it. “I’ve only worn it twice. I thought I might pop it on in the summer and drive round in the Ferrari. We were all going to get them and drive round in them but I was the only one who did. I’ve been thinking about it and if I didn’t wear the head it would make an amazing fur coat-with legs, you see. I would like a fur coat but I’ve never run into any.”</p>\n<p>One feels that his possessions — to which he adds daily-have got the upper hand; all the tape recorders, the five television sets, the cars, the telephones of which he knows not a single number. The moment he approaches a switch it fuses; six of the winking boxes, guaranteed to last till next Christmas, have gone funny already. His cars-the Rolls, the Mini-Cooper (black wheels, black windows), the Ferrari (being painted black) — puzzle him. Then there’s the swimming pool, the trees sloping away beneath it. “Nothing like what I ordered,” he said resignedly. He wanted the bottom to be a mirror. “It’s an amazing household,” he said. “None of my gadgets really work except the gorilla suit — that’s the only suit that fits me.”</p>\n<p>He is very keen on books, will always ask what is good to read. He buys quantities of books and these are kept tidily in a special room. He has Swift, Tennyson, Huxley, Orwell, costly leather-bound editions of Tolstoy, Oscar Wilde. Then there’s Little Women, all the William books from his childhood; and some unexpected volumes such as Forty-One Years In India, by Field Marshal Lord Roberts, and Curiosities of Natural History, by Francis T. Buckland. This last-with its chapter headings ‘Ear-less Cats’, ‘Wooden-Legged People,’ ‘The Immortal Harvey’s Mother’ is right up his street.</p>\n<p>He approaches reading with a lively interest untempered by too much formal education. “I’ve read millions of books,” he said, “that’s why I seem to know things.” He is obsessed by Celts. “I have decided I am a Celt,” he said. “I am on Boadicea’s side — all those bloody blue-eyed blondes chopping people up. I have an awful feeling wishing I was there — not there with scabs and sores but there through reading about it. The books don’t give you more than a paragraph about how they lived; I have to imagine that.”</p>\n<p>He can sleep almost indefinitely, is probably the laziest person in England. “Physically lazy,” he said. “I don’t mind writing or reading or watching or speaking, but sex is the only physical thing I can be bothered with any more.” Occasionally he is driven to London in the Rolls by an ex-Welsh guardsman called Anthony; Anthony has a moustache that intrigues him.</p>\n<p>The day I visited him he had been invited to lunch in London, about which he was rather excited. “Do you know how long lunch lasts?” he asked. “I’ve never been to lunch before. I went to a Lyons the other day and had egg and chips and a cup of tea. The waiters kept looking and saying: ‘No, it isn’t him, it can’t be him’.”</p>\n<p>He settled himself into the car and demonstrated the television, the folding bed, the refrigerator, the writing desk, the telephone. He has spent many fruitless hours on that telephone. “I only once got through to a person,” he said, “and they were out.”</p>\n<p>Anthony had spent the weekend in Wales. John asked if they’d kept a welcome for him in the hillside and Anthony said they had. They discussed the possibility of an extension for the telephone. We had to call at the doctor’s because John had a bit of sea urchin in his toe. “Don’t want to be like Dorothy Dandridge,” he said, “dying of a splinter 50 years later.” He added reassuringly that he had washed the foot in question.</p>\n<p>We bowled along in a costly fashion through the countryside. “Famous and loaded” is how he describes himself now. “They keep telling me I’m all right for money but then I think I may have spent it all by the time I’m 40 so I keep going.

Management Style: The Polished Professional\r\n\r\nEpstein's management style was a complete departure from the rough-and-tumble norms of the early 1960s music scene. He approached it with the formal discipline of a high-end retailer, not a back-alley promoter.\r\n\r\n* **Impeccable Presentation (The \"Epstein Polish\"):** This was his signature. He believed that to be taken seriously, the band had to look and act professional at all times.\r\n  * **The Suits:** He famously replaced their black leather jackets and jeans with tailored, collarless suits designed by Douglas Millings. This made them look clean, uniform, and non-threatening.\r\n  * **The Bow:** He choreographed their synchronized bow at the end of each performance. This was a touch of pure showmanship, borrowed from theatre, that made them seem charming and respectful.\r\n  * **Onstage Conduct:** He forbade them from smoking, eating, drinking, or swearing on stage. They were to be disciplined performers.\r\n* **Absolute Loyalty and Protection:** Epstein was fiercely protective of \"his boys.\" He served as their gatekeeper, filtering press requests, handling criticism, and buffering them from the demands of the industry. He was their one-man PR machine.\r\n* **Hands-Off Creative Policy:** His golden rule was that he **never interfered with the music**. He didn't understand songwriting or music production, and he knew it. This earned him the total trust of John, Paul, and George. He handled the business so they could handle the art.\r\n* **Paternalistic Authority:** He was the undisputed boss. He handled their diaries, their travel, their finances (to an extent), and their public appearances. John Lennon, who rebelled against every other authority figure, deferred to Epstein. John said, \"We had complete faith in him when he was running us. To us, he was the expert.\"\r\n\r\n### 2. Business Practices: Visionary Ametuerism\r\n\r\nWhile Epstein had a brilliant vision for the band's image, his business acumen was a mix of groundbreaking instinct and naive incompetence. He was an excellent promoter but a poor negotiator.\r\n\r\n* **Getting the Record Deal:** After being rejected by nearly every label in London (including a famous rejection from Decca Records), Epstein's persistence landed them a deal with George Martin at EMI's small Parlophone label in 1962. His tenacity was his greatest asset here.\r\n\r\n* **The 25% Cut:** Epstein's management contract gave him 25% of the band's earnings, a high but not unheard-of rate for the time. This was one of his shrewder moves.\r\n\r\n* **The Merchandising Disaster (The Achilles' Heel):** This was his single greatest business failure, costing the band (and himself) tens of millions of dollars.\r\n  * In 1963, as Beatlemania exploded, Epstein was overwhelmed with merchandising offers. Instead of hiring an expert, he handed over the rights for all of North America—one of the largest markets in the world—to a company called Seltaeb (Beatles spelled backwards) for a shocking **10% of the profits**. A standard deal would have been closer to 80-90% for the artist.\r\n  * He simply didn't understand the scale of what was happening and gave away a fortune in licensing for wigs, dolls, lunchboxes, and countless other items. This decision haunted him and highlights his naivete in complex negotiations.\r\n\r\n* **Publishing Acumen:** In contrast, one of his smartest moves was setting up **Northern Songs**, a music publishing company co-owned by himself, The Beatles (specifically John and Paul), and music publisher Dick James. This ensured that Lennon and McCartney retained a significant share of the ownership and royalties from their own compositions, which was revolutionary at the time.\r\n\r\n* **Touring and Logistics:** He was a meticulous planner of their tours. Every detail was mapped out, but he often underestimated the sheer scale of Beatlemania. He booked them into venues that were far too small for the demand, leading to riots and security nightmares. He also agreed to flat fees for major concerts (like Shea Stadium) where a percentage of the gate would have been exponentially more profitable.\r\n\r\n**In Summary for Your Screenplay:**\r\n\r\nEpstein's character is defined by this duality:\r\n\r\n* **The Visionary:** He saw what The Beatles could become and polished them into a cultural jewel. He was a master of image and promotion. His desire for establishment approval is what drives him to secure the MBE in your story.\r\n* **The Naive Businessman:** He was out of his depth in high-stakes negotiations and made several catastrophic financial errors. This vulnerability could be a source of internal conflict for his character. He knows he's created a monster he can't fully control, and he's terrified of making a mistake that will bring it all crashing down. This fear would make him react strongly to any perceived misstep by the band, like John's irreverence.","src/content/research/epstein-business-management.md","40c73b3ef04998be",{html:1614,metadata:1615},"<h3 id=\"1-management-style-the-polished-professional\">1.

They were to be disciplined performers.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Absolute Loyalty and Protection:</strong> Epstein was fiercely protective of “his boys.” He served as their gatekeeper, filtering press requests, handling criticism, and buffering them from the demands of the industry. He was their one-man PR machine.</li>\n<li><strong>Hands-Off Creative Policy:</strong> His golden rule was that he <strong>never interfered with the music</strong>. He didn’t understand songwriting or music production, and he knew it. This earned him the total trust of John, Paul, and George. He handled the business so they could handle the art.</li>\n<li><strong>Paternalistic Authority:</strong> He was the undisputed boss. He handled their diaries, their travel, their finances (to an extent), and their public appearances. John Lennon, who rebelled against every other authority figure, deferred to Epstein. John said, “We had complete faith in him when he was running us. To us, he was the expert.”</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"2-business-practices-visionary-ametuerism\">2. Business Practices: Visionary Ametuerism</h3>\n<p>While Epstein had a brilliant vision for the band’s image, his business acumen was a mix of groundbreaking instinct and naive incompetence. He was an excellent promoter but a poor negotiator.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Getting the Record Deal:</strong> After being rejected by nearly every label in London (including a famous rejection from Decca Records), Epstein’s persistence landed them a deal with George Martin at EMI’s small Parlophone label in 1962. His tenacity was his greatest asset here.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>The 25% Cut:</strong> Epstein’s management contract gave him 25% of the band’s earnings, a high but not unheard-of rate for the time. This was one of his shrewder moves.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>The Merchandising Disaster (The Achilles’ Heel):</strong> This was his single greatest business failure, costing the band (and himself) tens of millions of dollars.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>In 1963, as Beatlemania exploded, Epstein was overwhelmed with merchandising offers. Instead of hiring an expert, he handed over the rights for all of North America—one of the largest markets in the world—to a company called Seltaeb (Beatles spelled backwards) for a shocking <strong>10% of the profits</strong>. A standard deal would have been closer to 80-90% for the artist.</li>\n<li>He simply didn’t understand the scale of what was happening and gave away a fortune in licensing for wigs, dolls, lunchboxes, and countless other items. This decision haunted him and highlights his naivete in complex negotiations.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Publishing Acumen:</strong> In contrast, one of his smartest moves was setting up <strong>Northern Songs</strong>, a music publishing company co-owned by himself, The Beatles (specifically John and Paul), and music publisher Dick James. This ensured that Lennon and McCartney retained a significant share of the ownership and royalties from their own compositions, which was revolutionary at the time.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Touring and Logistics:</strong> He was a meticulous planner of their tours. Every detail was mapped out, but he often underestimated the sheer scale of Beatlemania. He booked them into venues that were far too small for the demand, leading to riots and security nightmares. He also agreed to flat fees for major concerts (like Shea Stadium) where a percentage of the gate would have been exponentially more profitable.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>In Summary for Your Screenplay:</strong></p>\n<p>Epstein’s character is defined by this duality:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>The Visionary:</strong> He saw what The Beatles could become and polished them into a cultural jewel. He was a master of image and promotion. His desire for establishment approval is what drives him to secure the MBE in your story.</li>\n<li><strong>The Naive Businessman:</strong> He was out of his depth in high-stakes negotiations and made several catastrophic financial errors. This vulnerability could be a source of internal conflict for his character. He knows he’s created a monster he can’t fully control, and he’s terrified of making a mistake that will bring it all crashing down. This fear would make him react strongly to any perceived misstep by the band, like John’s irreverence.</li>\n</ul>",{headings:1616,localImagePaths:1623,remoteImagePaths:1624,frontmatter:1625,imagePaths:1628},[1617,1620],{depth:64,slug:1618,text:1619},"1-management-style-the-polished-professional","1.

Key Influences and Background\r\n\r\nBrian Epstein was not a typical rock and roll manager. He was a well-spoken, upper-middle-class Jewish man from Liverpool whose family owned a successful furniture and appliance store (NEMS - North End Music Stores). His background profoundly shaped his approach to managing The Beatles.\r\n\r\n* **Retail and Presentation:** His family business taught him the importance of **presentation, professionalism, and customer service**. He saw The Beatles not just as a band, but as a *product* to be polished and sold to the widest possible audience. This is where the suits, the matching haircuts, and the famous coordinated bow at the end of performances came from. He was essentially their brand manager.\r\n* **Theatrical Aspirations:** Before taking over the family business, Epstein attended the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA) in London, alongside future stars like Peter O'Toole. Though he dropped out, his love for theatre and showmanship never left him. He saw the theatrical potential in The Beatles' raw energy and charisma.\r\n* **Class and Respectability:** Epstein was deeply insecure about his status as a gay Jewish man in a largely homophobic and class-conscious Britain. A significant part of his motivation was a desperate desire for **respectability and acceptance** by the establishment. Managing The Beatles was his way of proving his worth. Getting them an MBE was, for him, the ultimate validation—proof that his \"boys\" had been accepted at the highest level.\r\n\r\n### 2. How He Got into Management and Met The Beatles\r\n\r\nEpstein's entry into management was almost accidental, a story that has become rock and roll legend.\r\n\r\n* **The NEMS Record Department:** Epstein ran the record department at the family's main store on Great Charlotte Street, and he turned it into one of the biggest music retailers in the north of England. He was known for his meticulous stocking and his ability to get any record a customer wanted.\r\n* **The 'My Bonnie' Request (October 1961):** The story goes that a young fan named Raymond Jones came into NEMS asking for a record called \"My Bonnie\" by a band called The Beatles. Epstein, priding himself on knowing every record, had never heard of it. He learned it was a German import where the Liverpool band backed singer Tony Sheridan.\r\n* **The Cavern Club (November 9, 1961):** Intrigued by the local demand, Epstein went to see The Beatles perform during a lunchtime session at The Cavern Club, a sweaty, cramped, and chaotic cellar. He was completely out of place in his smart suit, but he was mesmerized. He saw past their rough, leather-clad appearance and recognized their raw charisma, musical talent, and powerful connection with the audience.\r\n* **The Offer:** Epstein saw their potential immediately. He offered to manage them, promising to get them a recording contract. The Beatles, who had been struggling for a professional break, were impressed by his professionalism and ambition. They signed a management contract with him in January 1962. Epstein's key promises were:\r\n    1. He would never interfere with their music.\r\n    2. He would handle all the business, leaving them free to create.\r\n    3. He would make them \"bigger than Elvis.\"\r\n\r\n### 3. The Impact of His Death (August 27, 1967)\r\n\r\nBrian Epstein's accidental death from a drug overdose at age 32 was arguably the single most critical event leading to the breakup of The Beatles. He was the glue that held them together.\r\n\r\n* **John Lennon:** John was arguably the most devastated. He saw Brian as a father figure and protector. In interviews, he later said, **\"After Brian died, we collapsed. Paul took over and supposedly led us. But what is leading us, when we went round in circles? We broke up then. That was the disintegration.\"** For John, Brian's death removed the one authority figure he truly respected, leaving a power vacuum that he felt Paul tried too eagerly to fill.\r\n\r\n* **Paul McCartney:** Paul was the most pragmatic. Recognizing the chaos, he tried to step into the leadership role to keep the band focused. This led to projects like the *Magical Mystery Tour* film, which was a critical and commercial failure. Paul's attempts to manage the band were often seen by the others, especially John and George, as bossy and controlling. He was trying to be the new \"dad,\" but he was their creative partner, and the dynamic was wrong. For your story, this is a key point: **Paul's attempts to hold the band together post-Epstein actually exacerbated the tensions Operation Minuet was designed to exploit.**\r\n\r\n* **George Harrison:** George respected Brian for fighting for his place in the band. Epstein had ensured George got his song placements and fair consideration. After his death, George felt even more marginalized. He saw the subsequent power struggles between John and Paul as egotistical and spiritually draining, which pushed him further into his spiritual quests and away from the band. In your narrative, Epstein's death removes the one person who could have refereed the Lennon-McCartney dynamic and protected George's creative space.\r\n\r\n* **Ringo Starr:** As the emotional anchor, Ringo felt the loss of the band's \"family\" structure most keenly. Brian was the buffer who absorbed the arguments and kept the peace. Without him, Ringo was often caught in the middle of the escalating fights, famously quitting the band for a short time during the White Album sessions because he felt so unloved and peripheral to the drama.\r\n\r\n**In Summary for Your Screenplay:**\r\n\r\nEpstein's death is the **inciting incident of Act 2**. It removes the band's central organizing principle and protector. This event leaves them completely vulnerable to the psychological pressures of Operation Minuet, which can now operate without any professional buffer. The natural fractures you established in Scene 5 become gaping wounds without Epstein there to suture them.","src/content/research/epstein-influences-impact.md","fe089801122a24c2",{html:1730,metadata:1731},"<h3 id=\"1-key-influences-and-background\">1.

The Impact of His Death (August 27, 1967)</h3>\n<p>Brian Epstein’s accidental death from a drug overdose at age 32 was arguably the single most critical event leading to the breakup of The Beatles. He was the glue that held them together.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>John Lennon:</strong> John was arguably the most devastated. He saw Brian as a father figure and protector. In interviews, he later said, <strong>“After Brian died, we collapsed. Paul took over and supposedly led us. But what is leading us, when we went round in circles? We broke up then. That was the disintegration.”</strong> For John, Brian’s death removed the one authority figure he truly respected, leaving a power vacuum that he felt Paul tried too eagerly to fill.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Paul McCartney:</strong> Paul was the most pragmatic. Recognizing the chaos, he tried to step into the leadership role to keep the band focused. This led to projects like the <em>Magical Mystery Tour</em> film, which was a critical and commercial failure. Paul’s attempts to manage the band were often seen by the others, especially John and George, as bossy and controlling. He was trying to be the new “dad,” but he was their creative partner, and the dynamic was wrong. For your story, this is a key point: <strong>Paul’s attempts to hold the band together post-Epstein actually exacerbated the tensions Operation Minuet was designed to exploit.</strong></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>George Harrison:</strong> George respected Brian for fighting for his place in the band. Epstein had ensured George got his song placements and fair consideration. After his death, George felt even more marginalized. He saw the subsequent power struggles between John and Paul as egotistical and spiritually draining, which pushed him further into his spiritual quests and away from the band. In your narrative, Epstein’s death removes the one person who could have refereed the Lennon-McCartney dynamic and protected George’s creative space.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Ringo Starr:</strong> As the emotional anchor, Ringo felt the loss of the band’s “family” structure most keenly. Brian was the buffer who absorbed the arguments and kept the peace. Without him, Ringo was often caught in the middle of the escalating fights, famously quitting the band for a short time during the White Album sessions because he felt so unloved and peripheral to the drama.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>In Summary for Your Screenplay:</strong></p>\n<p>Epstein’s death is the <strong>inciting incident of Act 2</strong>. It removes the band’s central organizing principle and protector. This event leaves them completely vulnerable to the psychological pressures of Operation Minuet, which can now operate without any professional buffer. The natural fractures you established in Scene 5 become gaping wounds without Epstein there to suture them.</p>",{headings:1732,localImagePaths:1742,remoteImagePaths:1743,frontmatter:1744,imagePaths:1747},[1733,1736,1739],{depth:64,slug:1734,text:1735},"1-key-influences-and-background","1.

Defining Characteristics of His Speech\r\n\r\nEpstein's speech was famously distinct from that of \"his boys.\" It was a cultivated, precise, and persuasive instrument that he used to project an image of authority, sophistication, and trustworthiness in a world that was often suspicious of both rock and roll music and Liverpool accents.\r\n\r\n* **Received Pronunciation (RP) / \"Posh\" Accent:** Epstein did not have a Scouse accent. He spoke with a clear, upper-middle-class RP accent, often described as \"posh\" or \"plummy.\" This immediately signaled his social standing and education, making him a more acceptable figure to London-based record executives, promoters, and broadcasters. This accent was his passport into the establishment.\r\n\r\n* **Deliberate and Precise Diction:** He enunciated every word with meticulous care. His speech was unhurried, with measured pauses that gave his statements a sense of gravity and thoughtfulness. He rarely used slang or colloquialisms, opting for a formal, almost theatrical vocabulary.\r\n\r\n* **Theatrical Cadence:** A frustrated actor, Epstein's public speaking often had a dramatic, persuasive rhythm. He would build his sentences carefully, using tone and emphasis to sell an idea, whether he was calming a frantic journalist or pitching The Beatles to a skeptical executive.\r\n\r\n* **Understated but Firm Tone:** Despite the polish, his tone was one of absolute, unwavering conviction. When he spoke about The Beatles, it was with a quiet, intense confidence that was incredibly persuasive. He did not shout or bluster; his authority came from his certainty.\r\n\r\n### 2.

A great deal of raw, untaped, undisciplined, er, talent.\"**\r\n    > — *Brian Epstein, interview circa 1963*\r\n  * **Analysis:** Note the slight, thoughtful pauses (\"uh...\"). The use of formal words like \"struck\" and \"personal charm.\" The phrase \"raw, untaped, undisciplined\" is perfectly balanced and delivered with the precision of a written statement, showing how he crafted his narrative about the band.\r\n\r\n* > **\"Quite simply, they are the greatest composers since Beethoven.\"**\r\n    > — *Brian Epstein, said on multiple occasions*\r\n  * **Analysis:** This is not an off-the-cuff remark; it's a prepared, dramatic pronouncement. The delivery was always dead serious, without a hint of irony. It demonstrates his use of bold, theatrical statements to build the band's mythos. The formal structure (\"Quite simply...\") gives it the weight of a final verdict.\r\n\r\n* > **\"I can say that things are not as black as they have been painted.

He uses classic, slightly stiff idioms (\"not as black as they have been painted\"). He projects calm and control, speaking slowly and deliberately to reassure the press and the public. This is his \"gatekeeper\" voice—protective, formal, and unflappable.\r\n\r\n### 3. How Others Described His Speech\r\n\r\nAssociates and The Beatles themselves frequently commented on Epstein's distinctive way of speaking, as it was central to his identity and their relationship with him.\r\n\r\n* **Paul McCartney:**\r\n    > \"He was a lovely man, a very good man. He was very well-spoken. For us, he was the first 'posh' person we had ever met... He would say, 'Hullo, chaps! How are you?' and we'd be like, 'Alright, Bri.' He had this way of talking which was very reassuring. He looked and sounded like a businessman.\"\r\n\r\n* **George Martin:**\r\n    > \"He was a gentleman. He spoke beautifully and had impeccable manners. He came to me and spoke with such... charm and conviction. I was impressed by him before I was impressed by the Beatles' tape. His speech was that of an honourable man. You believed him.\"\r\n\r\n* **John Lennon:**\r\n    > John often did affectionate, teasing impersonations of Epstein's posh accent. He would mimic him saying things like, \"Now, now, boys, calm down, everything will be frightfully good.\" This highlights the stark contrast between them, but underlying the mockery was a deep respect for the way Brian's \"posh\" talk opened doors for them.\r\n\r\n* **Ray Coleman (Biographer):**\r\n    > \"His voice was a cut-glass, soft, but persuasive instrument... It lacked a regional accent, placing him firmly in the middle class... It was the voice of a man who chose his words carefully, an actor manqué who always knew he was on stage.\"\r\n\r\n**In Summary for Your Screenplay:**\r\n\r\nEpstein's voice is his superpower and his armor.\r\n\r\n* **The Tool of Persuasion:** Use his deliberate, formal speech to show how he wins over skeptical figures. His dialogue should be precise and confident, especially when he's \"on.\"\r\n* **The Class Divide:** His accent instantly separates him from the Beatles. This can be used for comedic effect (their witty Scouse replies to his formal questions) but also to show his isolation. He is their ambassador to a world they don't belong to yet.\r\n* **Revealing Pressure:** A key dramatic device would be to show his polished speech cracking.

I mean, so, she’s on a train—\r\n\r\nJOHN: Yeah.\r\n\r\nPAUL: And he sort of—\r\n\r\nJOHN: And he goes to the station, and misses it.\r\n\r\nPAUL: [laughs] But he goes back and finds that it was the wrong number. So—\r\n\r\nGEORGE: “Wrong location.”\r\n\r\nJOHN: [officious voice] To rhyme with station, you know.\r\n\r\nPAUL: [laughs] That’s great, that. “The rail man said, ‘You’ve got the wrong location.’” “Well…” Great.

Whether John is intentionally implying the breakup of the Beatles as an eventuality or merely using an innocent turn of phrase is unclear, but it prompts both Paul and George to relays their optimism about the band’s future prospects as long as they remain focused.\r\n\r\nGeorge stresses the importance of rehearsing together until they have every number down by heart so that the band can go onstage again without insecurities and utterly assured of themselves and one another. He admits that the pain and tedium of the process has in the past frustrated his resolve in his own compositions and discouraged his level of involvement in the band (i.e. the others’ songs), but acknowledges that it is a necessary course to take and that they would not get anywhere without putting in raw hours of conscientious effort.\r\n\r\nIn this frame of mind, George contends that the Beatles could realign themselves once again as a band more than the sum of their parts if everyone approached every song as if it were their own with the same amount of care and creativity, and in a moment of (perhaps uncharacteristic) sentiment expresses that when the four of them have it together, there’s no one else he’d rather play with. \r\n\r\n(Note: Transcript under the cut, because I evidently have no concept of critical economy. In the audio clip, George drifts in and out of singing Janis Joplin’s ‘Piece Of My Heart’; John is the one on the organ halfway through.)\r\n\r\nGEORGE: That band – uh, that band Bonnie & Delaney, for Apple, are more together than we’ve ever been. You know, as a band.\r\n\r\nJOHN: Yeah.\r\n\r\nGEORGE: [inaudible] You know, everyone’s who has ever been to see them playing, and sounding, their lives change. It’s really exciting when you hear a real groove on—\r\n\r\nJOHN: You see, I think when we’ve done a month of this and that, and we do an album, that somehow we should either use what we’ve – the togetherness, to do the album. You know.\r\n\r\nGEORGE: Yeah, to do a new one.\r\n\r\nPAUL: Yeah?\r\n\r\nJOHN: Yeah. But you know what I mean. We – we’re – we don’t fit. We’ve sort of run out of touch with it. If we get into the swinging of playing, let’s do an album after this album. You know, about a month later. That is, if we all— [inaudible]\r\n\r\nPAUL: But I mean, you know—\r\n\r\nJOHN: I mean, if we spend two – a month on this—\r\n\r\nPAUL: We are.\r\n\r\nJOHN: —just get to a good peak playing, and then we split.\r\n\r\nPAUL: No, well, we should – we should sort of organise our career, man.\r\n\r\nGEORGE: Yeah.\r\n\r\nPAUL: Get our career together. And this, you know, this is like the idea of this. It’s to get us so we quite enjoy this. Of doing it again. And then what would we like to do next? Well, I would like— [inaudible] —to do a live show, lads?\r\n\r\nGEORGE: Yeah. I think – I think when we learn to, like [inaudible] then we’d dig it. And we know ‘em all, what – you know, if somebody could say “that one” [and we could play them] when we were asked, that’d be great.\r\nPAUL: Well, we can do it, but— [inaudible]\r\n\r\nGEORGE: It’s just that choice. It’s like hard work, really, to do it. And uh, it’s – you know, it’s a drag to try and, you know – ‘cause I want to remember all the words—\r\nPAUL: Right.\r\n\r\nGEORGE: —and really, really get ‘em the way I want it to get ‘em, and to get the guitar, [and not keep being] made to perform when I don’t want to play the guitar. And then you’ve got to play the guitar… when you’re not ready for it. But that… that’s alright.\r\n\r\nPAUL: I don’t know, you know, I mean—\r\n\r\nGEORGE: I mean, we’ve got to do that in order to get the good bit.\r\n\r\nPAUL: Right, yeah.\r\n\r\nGEORGE: We’ve got to get through that bit of shit of the meeting until we get it together again.\r\n\r\nPAUL: [receptive] You know, I can see it just – so we’re just working.\r\n\r\nGEORGE: But – and also there’s so much to get out, you know…\r\n\r\nPAUL: Yeah, right.\r\n\r\nGEORGE: [sincere] And there’s nobody better to get it out with than us. For me, anyway, really. In my heart of hearts.\r\n\r\nPAUL: [long pause; reserved] Yeah.\r\n\r\nGEORGE: It should be where – you know, if you write a song, I feel as though I’ve wrote it. And mine versus – vice versa. You know, I mean – or to be involved, really, as much, as if… That was the good thing about the last album, [because] it’s the only album so far I’ve tried to get involved with.\r\n\r\nPAUL: Yeah.\r\n\r\nGEORGE: [inaudible]\r\n\r\nPAUL: Mm.\r\n\r\nGEORGE: The last one.\r\n\r\n## 1/6\r\n\r\nJanuary 6th, 1969 (Twickenham Film Studios, London): While waiting for the other Beatles to arrive, Paul plays ‘Oh! Darling’ on the piano for the first time in the studio.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nJanuary 6th, 1969 (Twickenham Film Studios, London): John allies himself unquestioningly with Paul as the group tries out different lyric variations for the chorus of ‘Don’t Let Me Down’. George tries his best to offer his own input. (Note: This is the first part of an ongoing series breaking down that Paul and George argument in the Let It Be film documentary - the Lennon-McCartney team vs. Harrison. Judging by the session tapes, Paul seems to have had a surprising amount of creative involvement in what is essentially a John song. The dialogue that was eventually edited into the scene as depicted in the film is highlighted in bold.)\r\n\r\nGEORGE: If what you’re saying is what [John] said, then it’s easy, ’cause if you don’t know the words, then he tells you what you’re saying.\r\n\r\nPAUL: Yeah I know, but you see, like you said, it was corny before, and so to change the corniness, I was changing the words—\r\n\r\nGEORGE: Yeah, but the corny beginsel I thought was the notes that he was doing, you know, and the way he was doing it, not really what he was saying— \r\n\r\nPAUL: Yeah. So – okay.\r\n\r\nGEORGE: —and if it seems good, it doesn’t matter what—\r\n\r\nPAUL: What I’m trying to say is, you can get – I think you can get around the beginsel by singing the corny notes first, and having new words, and – you know. So I’m – but it’s like – so we still have to try and do it. So you still keep saying it’s wrong. Well, let’s try it. And then when we’ve tried it, then we can see if it’s wrong, you know.\r\n\r\nGEORGE: You already seem to have tried it a lot.\r\n\r\nPAUL: Yeah, I know, but we haven’t – we still haven’t done this. I’m in love for the first time in my life. “Don’t you know it’s gonna last.” [pause] “I’ll never let it get away.” [laughs] It’s a love that lasts forever…\r\n\r\nJOHN: “Forever and a day.”\r\n\r\nPAUL: Yeah. There’s some – there’s some new words there. And – and guitar–\r\n\r\nJOHN: I just haven’t tied to a way of singing yet.\r\n\r\nPAUL: No, that’s what I mean, you know, that’s all I want – to just have them–\r\n\r\nJOHN: Can you both do it, ’cause – okay.\r\n\r\nPAUL: Yeah. I’m in love for the first time…\r\n\r\nPAUL & GEORGE: For the first time in my life…\r\n\r\nJOHN: Don’t you know it’s gonna last…\r\n\r\nPAUL & GEORGE: Don’t ever let it get away…\r\n\r\nJOHN: It’s a love that lasts forever…\r\n\r\nGEORGE: I just wanna say— [playing halts]\r\n\r\nPAUL: [to George] I just want to get a bit – we’ll try, you know. We’ll go right through. But you keep talking about it. \r\n\r\nGEORGE: You see, if he was, say, if it was like— [plays different rhythm] Like that, you know. “You know it’s gonna last.”\r\n\r\nPAUL: [impatient] Yeah, sure, let’s just repeat whatever you say.\r\n\r\nGEORGE: Don’t you know it’s gonna last…\r\n\r\nJOHN & PAUL: I’m in love for the first time…\r\n\r\nPAUL & GEORGE: For the first time in my life…\r\n\r\nJOHN: Don’t you know it’s gonna last…\r\n\r\nPAUL & GEORGE: Don’t you know it’s gonna last…\r\n\r\nJOHN: It’s a love that lasts forever…\r\n\r\nPAUL & GEORGE: It’s a love that lasts forever…\r\n\r\nJOHN: It’s a love that has no past…\r\n\r\nPAUL & GEORGE: It’s a love that has no past…\r\n\r\nJOHN: Don’t let me down… [playing halts]\r\n\r\nPAUL: Okay, that’s – that’s alright. That’s—\r\n\r\nJOHN: Yes. [to George] I can’t hear you.\r\n\r\nGEORGE: Right.\r\n\r\nPAUL: No, uh—\r\n\r\nGEORGE: I think it’s awful. I’m trying to get it started—\r\n\r\nPAUL: Uh… okay.\r\n\r\nJOHN: [to George] Well, have you got anything? To supplant it?\r\n\r\nPAUL: [to George] Okay, yeah, come on. Do something better, then.\r\n\r\nGEORGE: Well, I just think that, you know– I think, for a start, it’d be better to sing – [plays descending chords] instead of— [plays repeating chords] Ah… For the first time…\r\n\r\nPAUL: Yeah, but see, in a way, that’s even cornier, I think. That – that little harmony bit, it’s just too – it’s too pretty.\r\n\r\nGEORGE: Well it’s just there’s one holding – it’s like that. [plays staggered chords] I mean at the moment, it’s just— [plays straight chords] And maybe it’s cornier if you do [plays staggered chords], a groove like that—\r\nPAUL: Yeah.\r\n\r\nGEORGE: But if it’s something like that— [plays sustained chords]\r\n\r\nPAUL: Okay. Now for the first time in my life… One, two, three – you take the lower one, then.\r\n\r\nJOHN: I’m in love for the first time…\r\n\r\nPAUL & GEORGE: I’m in love for the first time…\r\n\r\nJOHN: Don’t you know it’s gonna last…\r\n\r\nPAUL & GEORGE: Don’t you know it’s gonna last…\r\n\r\nJOHN: It’s a love that lasts forever…\r\n\r\nPAUL & GEORGE: It’s a love that lasts forever…\r\n\r\nJOHN: It’s a love that has no past!\r\n\r\nPAUL & GEORGE: It’s a love that has no past… [playing halts]\r\n\r\nGEORGE: I thought we should do something like this— [plays different rhythm]\r\n\r\nPAUL: No. You see—\r\n\r\nGEORGE: [continues playing] It’s a love that lasts forever, love that lasts forever, love that lasts forever…\r\n\r\nJOHN: [unconvinced] Yeah, well, that’s it. [pause] I think you should just get a corny one first, and then start doing that bit. You know, you’ll start to get the rhythm to it, and then sort of change it.\r\n\r\nGEORGE: [plays differently] Love that’s gonna last… Da da da da da da…\r\n\r\nPAUL: Yeah, that’s it. [George continues playing] Uh… [George’s playing halts] Let’s just sing, you know, the corny one. [laughs]\r\n\r\nJOHN: Yeah, do the corny one.\r\n\r\nPAUL: Just to get this bit, you know. And then we can like – you see, that’s it. We’ll make it better as it goes on.\r\n\r\nJOHN: Yeah. I mean – I—\r\n\r\nPAUL: But if we don’t, then it just doesn’t go on. You know, we’ve just gone round for like an hour, with nothing in our heads. Just— And we’re back, you know. So let’s—\r\n\r\nGEORGE: I can keep doing the permutations, then.\r\n\r\nPAUL: Yeah, I know, but let’s just sort of move on, now. Let’s just get this.\r\n\r\nJOHN: I’d like to hear any of ‘em – right ones.\r\n\r\nPAUL: Yeah. Right, okay. So repeat exactly what he says, but then we can’t, on one of the lines. So, I’m in love for the first time…\r\n\r\nGEORGE: See, that’s why you don’t get any further, because you just kept using the same lines against the one that doesn’t work—\r\n\r\nPAUL: [ignores] For the first time in my life…\r\n\r\nJOHN: Don’t you know it’s gonna last…\r\n\r\nGEORGE: [grudging] It’s a love that’s gonna last…\r\n\r\nJOHN: It’s a love that lasts forever…\r\n\r\nPAUL & GEORGE: It’s a love that lasts forever…\r\n\r\nJOHN: It’s a love that has no past… [playing halts] Love that lasts forever, love that lasts…\r\n\r\nPAUL: Okay, so how about, how about – changing ‘round these two, and when you sing, “don’t you know it’s gonna last,” we sing, “it’s a love that has no past.” And then we repeat, “it’s a love that lasts forever,” exactly. And then when you sing, “it’s a love that has no past,” we sing “it’s a love that’s gonna last.”\r\n\r\nJOHN: Yes. I agree.\r\n\r\nPAUL: Okay? So, I’m in love for the— “Love for the first time in my life.” “It’s a love that has no past.” Swap that \r\none for the other. So that when he’s singing that, we’re singing the other. Then, “it’s a love that lasts forever,” repeat that – even though it sounds funny, it’ll be alright. And then, “don’t you know it’s gonna last.” Just try it through, roughly.\r\n\r\nGEORGE: I’m trying to—\r\n\r\nPAUL: Listen – uh, uh.\r\n\r\nJOHN: I’m in love for the first time…\r\n\r\nPAUL & GEORGE: Love for the first time in my life…\r\n\r\nJOHN: Don’t you know it’s gonna last…\r\n\r\nPAUL & GEORGE: It’s a love that has no past…\r\n\r\nJOHN: It’s a love that lasts forever… [playing halts]\r\n\r\nPAUL: Okay, uh, The only time that works, really, is on the last line. So we sing, “love for the first time—” Just, just try it all exactly as it is. Repeating that. We’ll just on the last time. Sing, repeat, “it’s a love that’s gonna last,” and then you say, “it’s a love that has no past.”\r\n\r\nJOHN: Okay.\r\n\r\nPAUL: You see, it’s verging between ridiculous and alright, that, you know. Singing different words. ’Cause it is like—\r\n\r\nJOHN: That’s the bones of it, though. [inaudible; playing guitar] She’s in, she’s in pain, you know. [laughs]\r\n\r\nPAUL: [laughs] Okay.\r\n\r\nJOHN: I’m in love for the first time…\r\n\r\nPAUL & GEORGE: For the first time in my life…\r\n\r\nJOHN: Don’t you know it’s gonna last…\r\n\r\nPAUL & GEORGE: Don’t you know it’s gonna last…\r\n\r\nJOHN: It’s a love that lasts forever…\r\n\r\nPAUL & GEORGE: It’s a love that lasts forever…\r\n\r\nJOHN: It’s a love that has no past…\r\n\r\nPAUL & GEORGE: It’s a love that’s gonna last…\r\n\r\nGEORGE: Can I make a suggestion there, for the last line?\r\n\r\nPAUL: What?\r\n\r\nGEORGE: Well, forget the last line. It’s a love that lasts forever…\r\n\r\nPAUL: It’s a love that has no past… dun dun dun dun dun dun. Don’t let me down… Okay.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nJanuary 6th, 1969 (Twickenham Film Studios, London): The Beatles run through the chorus of ‘Don’t Let Me Down’ and try to iron out the contentious problems with the arrangement. (Note: This is the second part of an ongoing series breaking down that Paul and George argument in the Let It Be film documentary. The dialogue that was eventually edited into the scene as depicted in the film is highlighted in bold. First part.) \r\n\r\nPAUL: So that’s – that’s near enough for the time being. [inaudible]\r\n\r\nJOHN: We’ve still got that hole, like at the—\r\n\r\nGEORGE: But really, it’s like that doesn’t sound all that… you know. I’m iffy on that.\r\n\r\nPAUL: Well, we’re gonna improve on that. But the—\r\n\r\nGEORGE: If we had a tape recorder now – just tape down, play it back, you’d throw that out straightaway.\r\n\r\nPAUL: Yeah, right, but—\r\n\r\nGEORGE: You know, really—\r\n\r\nPAUL: Yeah—\r\n\r\nGEORGE: —you’d throw it out right damn in—\r\n\r\nPAUL: Okay. Uh. Well, okay, that’s the—\r\n\r\nGEORGE: You know, it’s either be— I know, you know.\r\n\r\nPAUL: Yeah, I know, but you— [makes helpless sound]\r\n\r\nJOHN: [mediating] See, I think, there… [starts playing]\r\n\r\nPAUL: [to John] Give in!\r\n\r\nGEORGE: I’m in love for the first time…\r\n\r\nPAUL: I give in.\r\n\r\nJOHN: We’re right, but it’s wrong there, on that bit.\r\n\r\nGEORGE: You see, the first one’s not bad. [playing halts]\r\n\r\nJOHN: No, the thing that we’ve done is that we found out that’s the weak bit, right.\r\n\r\nPAUL: Yeah.\r\n\r\nJOHN: So we tried putting voices on it. But it’s still down to the rhythm, somehow. The ba— Love for the first time… [starts playing]\r\n\r\nPAUL: But it was always weak on your guitar.\r\n\r\nJOHN: [agreeing] Yeah, sure.\r\n\r\nPAUL: That’s the weak bit of the song, that.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nJanuary 6th, 1969 (Twickenham Film Studios, London): John briefly invokes Little Richard’s ‘Send Me Some Lovin’’ as a musical guide for ‘Don’t Let Me Down’. (Note: You may listen to early-70s!John singing ‘Send Me Some Lovin’’ here.)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nJanuary 6th, 1969 (Twickenham Film Studios, London): John offhandedly asks if he’s supposed to sing on ‘Two Of Us’, prompting Paul to run through the song sharing vocals with John for the first time.\r\n\r\nJOHN: Am I singing on this, or what?\r\n\r\nPAUL: I don’t know, really. [pause] Melody. Two of us… You have to remember the words too.\r\n\r\nJOHN: Yes, I’ve got ’em here.\r\n\r\nPAUL: Well, learn ’em.\r\n\r\nJOHN: Yeah. [pause] I almost know ’em.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nJanuary 6th, 1969 (Twickenham Film Studios, London): Paul and George have a fraught and ultimately sad exchange about responsibilities, expectations, and means to ends, with John in the uncommon role as mediator trying to move the sessions along. An increasingly anxious and self-conscious Paul is aware of his own tendency to direct the rehearsals but confesses himself at a loss for any other way to keep everyone productive, in tune, and in pace with their looming deadline without encroaching on everyone else’s egos, emotions, and individual working methods. George capitulates, contends his inability to conform to their current circumstances with Paul’s inability to compromise, and wonders despondently if Paul even knows what he really wants (for this project, for the group and its individual members, or for himself). (Note: This is the third part of a series breaking down that Paul and George argument in the Let It Be film documentary. The dialogue that was eventually edited into the scene as depicted in the film is highlighted in bold. First part, second part.) \r\n\r\nPAUL: You see, we’re really – we’re gonna have to sorta bring it together, because we’re all at odds, we’re doing that thing we did on The Beatles, we’re all playing, you know, like… [incoherent] Like in this verse, it’s two harmonies singing, trying to say some words, right. So like you know, you can just, duh duh dun… ch cha. And in the bits, when we need bits, we’re not—\r\n\r\nJOHN: Yeah I know the bits. I’m just trying to sing it, and do it through.\r\n\r\nPAUL: [plays] You know what I mean? We’ve got to get riffs, when the riff bits come up.\r\n\r\nGEORGE: The riffs. Uh, there’s no riffs. I mean, it’s nice to get – just to get what you’re playing—\r\n\r\nPAUL: No, but it’s just, look – you see, “you and I”, uh – on—\r\n\r\nGEORGE: You and I, our memories…\r\n\r\nPAUL: Uh, but it’s not – it’s not together, you see, so it’s not sounding together. Even on—\r\n\r\nGEORGE: So we can only play until we – until we can find the bit—\r\n\r\nPAUL: Or we can stop and say it’s not together.\r\n\r\nGEORGE: Yes, then you’ve got to carry on until we get it together. So I mean, that’s all, that’s all I can do is play—\r\n\r\nPAUL: Okay. Well, I, you know—\r\n\r\nGEORGE: —until it sounds as though it’s blending with the rest—\r\n\r\nPAUL: I never know what to say to that, you know, ’cause what I want to say is now come on, and play… you know.\r\n\r\nGEORGE: Yes, I know.\r\n\r\nPAUL: But I can’t, you know, because we get into that line.\r\n\r\nGEORGE: It does.\r\n\r\nPAUL: Okay. [laughs nervously] So, here we go. [starts playing] You know, I mean, well. Tell us something about that. I can’t make it eyond that. It’s like, it’s – it’s complicated now. So. See, if we can get simpler, and then complicate it where it needs complications, but it’s complicated in the bit—\r\n\r\nGEORGE: It’s not complicated. I’m just gonna—\r\n\r\nPAUL: I know, but I mean – you know.\r\n\r\nGEORGE: I mean, I’ll play just the chords, if you’ll like, and—\r\n\r\nPAUL: [hushed] No, come on, you always get like—\r\n\r\nGEORGE: —and then – but that’s all I’m trying to do—\r\n\r\nPAUL: [anxious] You always get annoyed when I say that. I’m – I’m trying to help, you know, but I always hear myself annoying you, and I’m trying to—\r\n\r\nGEORGE: No, you’re not annoying me.\r\n\r\nPAUL: —I get so I can’t say—\r\n\r\nGEORGE: [acquiescent] You don’t annoy me [anymore?].\r\n\r\nPAUL: But you know what I mean. You know, well, do this, then. [plays] And then… I don’t know. [long pause] Yeah. I can’t do it on film, either. [laughs; bleak] I don’t know if I can do it on camera. [long silence; guitar playing]\r\n\r\nJOHN: Do you want me to keep this up? [plays riff] ’Cause I’m trying to find something that’s nice to sing to—\r\n\r\nPAUL: Yeah, you see, I don’t mind—\r\n\r\nJOHN: Yeah, and—\r\n\r\nPAUL: —but doesn’t everyone agree that it’s confused at the moment?\r\n\r\nJOHN: Yeah.\r\n\r\nPAUL: So all I’m trying to say is – is like, let’s get the confusion unconfusing, and then confuse it. You know, like, we’re just – this is what we’ve been doing all afternoon. This is why we’re not getting anything done. You know, we’re just rolling on with it. We’ve only got twelve more days. So you know, we’ve really got to do this methodically, this one. Like unconfused, then a bit more confused, then a bit more, now try this drumming here, try this drumming there, now okay, let’s stop and go look into this bit—\r\n\r\nJOHN: Well, I’ve got an idea. I should vamp, ’cause I’ve got to sing, and it’s hard going— [plays rhythm]\r\n\r\nPAUL: Doing that?\r\n\r\nJOHN: But it’s annoying, you know. And let me do it— [plays rhythm]\r\n\r\nPAUL: Okay, can you do that—\r\n\r\nJOHN: I’ll do just that kind of vamping. [plays rhythm]\r\n\r\nPAUL: Yeah. [laughs] Drag it halfway through candid camera. [long pause; listening to John playing] Yeah.\r\n\r\nJOHN: [reassuring] Forget about candid camera.\r\n\r\nPAUL: [wan] Can’t, though. [quietly; to George] But you see we’ve been saying— [inaudible] —a lot of, uh— [inaudible] —that I can do about. You know, it’s like I’ve always found that – but I always feel it, though, like you think I’m trying to put you down, or stop you from playing, but I’m not. I’m trying to stop us all playing, until we know what we’re playing.\r\n\r\nGEORGE: Yeah, but you’ve got to play it in order to find which fits and which doesn’t.\r\n\r\nPAUL: Mm.\r\n\r\nGEORGE: You see, that’s all you can do in this—\r\n\r\nPAUL: But it’s like – I know, but I’m thinking of this other thing which is where we’re playing the solos. We’re improvising the solos, but we’ll play strict chords and strict rhythms.\r\n\r\nGEORGE: Yeah.\r\n\r\nPAUL: Without the vocals.\r\n\r\nGEORGE: [inaudible; drowned out by playing]\r\n\r\nPAUL: You know, but I don’t want to say it, because I really just hear myself as being the only one saying it. Always. And I just basically sort of sit there, like— [inaudible; drowned out by playing] —and I never get any support or anything. So I just think, “Oh well. [inaudible]” You know. It’s right. [to John] And you know it’s right.\r\n\r\nJOHN: [consenting] Yes, alright, but I just don’t know what to do about it.\r\n\r\nPAUL: Well, you know.\r\n\r\nJOHN: You know, I mean, up ’til then—\r\n\r\nGEORGE: I mean, I’ll wait until you figure out your bits and then work my part out, if you like.\r\n\r\nPAUL: No no no—\r\n\r\nGEORGE: It’s like that, it’s like a matter of working it out with you while you’re working your bit out. You know, if you’ve got your bass bit. [plays] You know, I mean, so. It just would—\r\n\r\nPAUL: I know, I know, but I’m—\r\n\r\nGEORGE: Because it’ll take even longer in a way, if there—\r\n\r\nPAUL: Look, I’m not trying to say that, and I’m not trying to say that about you. You know, you’re doing this again as though I’m trying to say that, and what we said the other day, you know – I’m not trying to get [at] you. But what I really am trying to just say is, “Look, lads.” The band, you know. “Should we try it like this?” You know.\r\n\r\nGEORGE: It’s funny now how it only occurs when you put the – on—\r\n\r\nPAUL: I know, if this one is like, “Should we play guitar all through ‘Hey Jude’?” Well, I don’t think we should, \r\nbut—\r\n\r\nGEORGE: Well, okay, I don’t mind, I’ll play, you know, whatever you want me to play. Or I won’t play at all, if you don’t want me to play. Now, whatever it is that will please you, I’ll do it. [pause] But I don’t think you really know what that one is. [long pause; playing]\r\n\r\nJOHN: [hedging] But do you want to take the [inaudible]?\r\n\r\nGEORGE: [singing quietly] Going nowhere…\r\n\r\nPAUL: [exasperated] No, okay, but don’t – come on. Look, you know—\r\n\r\nJOHN: The galloping bit. And I’ll just vamp.\r\n\r\nPAUL: Look, you know, the… [sighs] No, it’s not like that. You see, that’s it, it’s like, we can’t do this. We’ve really got to sort out this, ’cause we’re – this is  – we’re like – this is the one, you know. Now we’re rehearsing, and we’re trying to like get it together for a TV show, so we really – like you said, we’ve only been through four numbers, you know.\r\n\r\nGEORGE: Mm.\r\n\r\nJOHN: Well…\r\n\r\nPAUL: So we’ve probably got to get some system to get through like twenty, or thirty, and no more, and have learnt them. And it’s probably going to be like sculpture. So that we get all the chords. So we can all vamp and all. Then we can all play, like, every solo we need. But like… You know what I mean? It’s got to sound as though it’s improving.\r\n\r\nGEORGE: [careful] Yeah, well, it actually – it sounded to me, that for me, it was a waste of me time playing, when we started it today. I mean, I just started remembering then what it could get into the other day, after playing for around an hour, an hour and a half. And suddenly, you know, I just don’t find that my – that what I’m doing is starting to have something, you know. Have some structure to it. [pause] You know, that’s the thing.\r\n\r\nPAUL: Yeah, I know, I know what you mean, you know. ’Cause it’s like—\r\n\r\nGEORGE: You know, I mean—\r\n\r\nPAUL: It’s just that that way of doing it, you know, puts me off the way I’m trying to do it, and—\r\n\r\nGEORGE: [resigned] Well, that’s – you know. That’s all, then. I can only do me, in that one way, however I do it, \r\nyou know. [long pause]\r\n\r\nPAUL: [resigned] Let’s do another song.\r\n\r\nGEORGE: [commiserating] No, come on, we just have to learn this—\r\n\r\nPAUL: No, no, it’s – let’s just do something else.\r\n\r\nGEORGE: Do you want to do… ‘Maxwell Silver Hammer’?\r\n\r\nJOHN: [encouraging] Well, let’s do this, ’cause then we – we’re gonna come to this, or whatever it is. And the thing is just try and think what – the stage we’ve got to be in then.\r\n\r\nPAUL: You just have to know that. I think we’ve wasted a lot of time, I think. I think we do like waste, physically waste a heck of a lot of time, you know, when the four of us are together.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nJanuary 6th, 1969 (Twickenham Film Studios, London): In a discussion with John, Paul acknowledges the reluctant leadership role in the band he’s found himself in for the past few years and worries how the convergence of anxiety and authority in his direction may be hurting the group as a whole. John tries to reassure him otherwise, and George tries to meet him.\r\n\r\nGEORGE: But that’s like, I’ve learnt that bit, and I’m trying to – I’m trying to take that – those chords along with it…\r\n\r\nPAUL: [inaudible; drowned out by George’s voice] I’m not trying to – I only want to ask you. You know.\r\n\r\nJOHN: I think, it’s your song. And you’ve gotta— [inaudible] —gotta have it exactly how he wants to do it, you know. If you say, “Don’t play that, play that,” it’s up to you, you know. You sort of take it. ’Cause it’s your scene. If somebody’s gonna ask for [inaudible], it’s his song.\r\n\r\nPAUL: But now I – now I’m scared of that. To be the boss. And I – and I have been, for like, uh, a couple of years. \r\nAnd we all have, you know. There’s no pretending about that.\r\n\r\nJOHN: Yeah I know, but – but this—\r\n\r\nPAUL: And no one is [the boss]. That is what we decided, you know. And no one is—\r\n\r\nJOHN: But it’s all in—\r\n\r\nPAUL: And no one’s – you know how rush— [audio cuts off] —and this is why, you know, it’s chaos—\r\n\r\nGEORGE: You don’t boss out on us. It’s fine.\r\n\r\nPAUL: Until it sort of… That’s why we take so long! Because, really, you know, and we get sort of – so that’s the thing. We can play it shitty and all. I – I think we can play it shitty like ten times, so it’s sort of in there, and then I think we can kind of play it quite good, then. But it’s only – I don’t know, it’s just like different approaches, you know. I think we’d be better just learn, just doing it all, like uh, you know, the Red Norvo Five. Just really, like, uh—\r\n\r\nGEORGE: Vamping away.\r\n\r\nPAUL: Vamping, sort of efficient vamping, really, you know, and then get the imaginative thing. You know. [pauses] But anyway, I know it’s impossible for us to go like – because we can’t get into the moment, ’cause you don’t do it like that, and— [plays riff]\r\n\r\nGEORGE: I know, and I’m trying, but— [plays]\r\n\r\nPAUL: No no no I mean, just, generally… [John sings ‘Two Of Us’ under his breath] It’s like when you’ve been trying to get me to do it and I do it. And that’s how I do it, but that’s not how you do it. [everyone plays]\r\n\r\nJOHN: [laughs; stops playing] See, I suppose that’s how they do it.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nJanuary 6th, 1969 (Twickenham Film Studios, London): Paul, more out of desperation than decisiveness, proposes they resolve everyone’s conflicting working methods by allowing each one of them have undivided creative direction over their own compositions (which the others would then have to follow). George agrees with this solution, but John (having always had a more instinctive approach, as opposed to building songs brick by deliberate brick) suggests they continue to improvise. Paul briefly muses about the metaphysical nature of this discord.\r\n\r\nPAUL: [inaudible; drowned out by guitar] —of seeing yourself nearly go round a past you’ve been down too many times, you know I go down it, you know, like us going on about this. I really don’t want to go back to that. And it’s just silly. And I just can’t think of any solution out of here. The problem is that we should all arrange our own tunes, and if you want improvisation, then we should just say, you know, right, and—\r\n\r\nGEORGE: That’s the best way.\r\n\r\nPAUL: —and we improvise here. But look, it puts on much more work on each one of us, then, because then you’ve got to work out my bassline.\r\n\r\nJOHN: I’d say improvise it, like.\r\n\r\nPAUL: Yeah. [laughs bleakly] It’s like a bunch of theories, isn’t it? It’s like, it’s not just to do with playing music, this. It’s far further reaching, this sort of – this thing, you know.\r\n\r\nGEORGE: It’s always the far reaching end of it. It stems from the mad thing they call— [audio cuts off]\r\n\r\n## 1/7\r\n\r\n### ‘Golden Slumbers’ / ‘Carry That Weight’\r\n\r\nJanuary 7th, 1969: In the morning, Paul sings ‘Golden Slumbers’ and 'Carry That Weight’ by himself while waiting for the other Beatles to arrive in the studio.\r\n\r\n### I think we’ve got a bit shy, you know. I think I’ve got a bit shy of – certain things, you know.\r\n\r\nJanuary 7th, 1969: As Let It Be filmmaker Michael Lindsay-Hogg discusses how The Beatles should hold their show, Paul tries anxiously to rouse up some enthusiasm from the rest of the group - encouraging George to see the fun in performing onstage again, and relating futilely to John’s interests - to little avail. Or response. (Note: This vague idea for a show eventually turned into the iconic rooftop concert. The song George is singing at the beginning is Bob Dylan’s ‘My Back Pages’.)\r\n\r\nPAUL: But we had a lot more incentive, then.\r\n\r\nGEORGE: Ah, but I was so much older then… I’m younger than that now… \r\n\r\nPAUL: But we really don’t need— You know, those films of us [back then]– that was us doing it, you know. \r\n\r\nGEORGE: [chagrined] Well, if that’s what doing it is, that’s why I don’t want to do it.\r\n\r\nPAUL: Yeah. Yeah, I think—\r\n\r\nGEORGE: Because I never liked that. It was always a drag. \r\n\r\nPAUL: [upset] Yeah, but – right. You know. You know, uh— [faltering] You see, that – that takes the thing, and – and twists it a bit.\r\n\r\nGEORGE: Well, it does, because I never liked that. That’s why I—\r\n\r\nPAUL: Well, you see, nowadays, you’ve grown up. And you don’t have to do that anymore. \r\n\r\nGEORGE: Yeah. \r\n\r\nPAUL: You see, that’s it. You don’t have to do – put the pancake [makeup] up, and go out in front and sweat, and shake our heads, because we’re not that anymore. We’ve grown up a bit. \r\n\r\nGEORGE: Because we’ve done that anyway.\r\n\r\nPAUL: Yeah, right. So what I mean is, we did it then, but it doesn’t mean, like, to do it again, we have to do all that.\r\n\r\nMICHAEL: Right.\r\n\r\nPAUL: Because now, like – for him to do it, is do it in a black bag with Yoko, you know. [to John] And – and you’re doing it. [pause] I suppose. \r\n\r\nGEORGE: White bag. \r\n\r\nMICHAEL: A white bag.\r\n\r\nPAUL: White bag. [pause; to John] But that’s it, you’re doing it, then, on this level, you know. But – you know. I mean, I—\r\n\r\nMICHAEL: But do you see it as – do you still want to perform for an audience, or do you just see yourselves sort of as recording people?\r\n\r\nPAUL: I think—\r\n\r\nMICHAEL: You see, but I think John’s right. It’s communication. And I think part of communication is seeing you doing it. \r\n\r\nPAUL: I think there’s something to do with an audience, there, yeah. I think – [pause] I think we’ve got a bit shy, you know. I think I’ve got a bit shy of – certain things, you know. And it’s like, uh – it is like that. It’s like, um—\r\n\r\nMICHAEL: I guess maybe the difficulty is also getting up in front of an audience, if – all you’ve done in front of an audience is trying to get something as good, but maybe not the same thing. You know, and it’s a very hard thing to get back. In other words, you musn’t think of getting back what you had. Because you don’t want—\r\n\r\nPAUL: No, that’s what Yoko was saying the other day, you know. We don’t – we musn’t try and get in the audience, and get them wild, and get—\r\n\r\nMICHAEL: Although they may be. [inaudible] Because they’ve grown up as well. I mean, everyone in this room has grown up. \r\n\r\nPAUL: Yeah. \r\n\r\nMICHAEL: You know what I mean?\r\n\r\nPAUL: Sure, yeah. That’s – that’s what’s great about it, you know. That’s why I don’t think we need to sort of play down, or do anything – we’ve really got to do what we do, but like, with the same kind of… No, it’s not even – it’s not even discipline, it’s the same kind of—\r\n\r\nMICHAEL: Drive. \r\n\r\nPAUL: Dr– desire to do it.\r\n\r\nMICHAEL: Desire. To do it.\r\n\r\nPAUL: You know, it’s like – it’s like all these songs, you know. There are some really great songs, and I just hope we don’t blow any of them. [to John] Because you know how often like on albums we sometimes blow one of your songs, because we come in in the wrong mood, and uh, you say, “This is how it goes, I’ll be back.” And we’re all just, [flustered voice] “Oh, uh, you—” Chuga chuga chuga chuga...\r\n\r\nMICHAEL: That’s why we’re wrong to throw away the show. Because there’s no desire –  I mean like, sure, I think I, M. L. H., can do a show with you better than anybody in the world, because I’ve got to be the best rock'n'roll director in the world, he says without any false humility. But equally, at the moment, we haven’t got a show, and so none of us are gonna want to do it. \r\n\r\nPAUL: Yeah, I know what you—\r\n\r\nMICHAEL: And the trouble is, that is why George was saying – he’s saying, “None of us want to do a show, because it ain’t a show.” And it’s like—\r\nPAUL: Yeah. \r\n\r\nMICHAEL: —we’ve got to find something else to go out and do it.\r\n\r\nGEORGE: And it’s that thing about – of the songs, too, you know. ‘Cause really, I don’t want to do any of my songs on the show, because I know they’ll always just turn out shitty, like—\r\n\r\nPAUL: No, but you see – no, see, this is where I think, though—\r\n\r\nGEORGE: Because, uh, they come out like a compromise, whereas in a studio they can—\r\n\r\nPAUL: [anxious] But you see – look, George—\r\n\r\nGEORGE: —work on ‘em, ‘til you want ‘em… and get it out of your mind.\r\n\r\nPAUL: Last year, you were telling me, that, “You can do anything you want, Paul.”\r\n\r\nGEORGE: Yeah.\r\n\r\nPAUL: “Anything you desire, you can do,” you know.\r\n\r\nGEORGE: Yeah.\r\n\r\nPAUL: Now, but these days—\r\n\r\nGEORGE: But you have to desire it.\r\n\r\nPAUL: [trying] But you’re saying – before this show is finished, before we’ve done it— Now, like the arrow, letting forth, is letting forth on this word of, “We’re not going to be able to do it, we’re going to come out a compromise.” Now, I don’t think that! I really don’t. I think you – we’ve done it, you know. I think we’ve – I really think we’re very good. And we can get it together, if we think that we want to do these songs great, we can just do it great, you know. But I think thinking it’s not going to come out great won’t help.\r\n\r\nGEORGE: Yeah.\r\n\r\nPAUL: You know, that’s like – that is like meditation, where you just – you get into a bummer, and you come out of \r\nit. You don’t go through it, you know. \r\n\r\nRINGO: Yeah.\r\n\r\nPAUL: I think we can, like, help, if we – you know, on anything like that. [to Ringo] If – so, okay, if you’re sick of playing the drums, we’ve all gotta say, “Look, we’re sick too, you know, pat pat, look, you know, it’s all the same,” and… we go through it with you. It’s no use just saying, “Well, fuck off, then.” “Oh, fuck that.” You know? What’s good, that?\r\n\r\n### I mean, I’ll – I’ll sit in a corner with Mal, on the tour, or I’ll sit here, and I’ll – I’ll anything. ’Cause I – I enjoy it all. That’s the only thing I enjoy, actually.\r\n\r\nJanuary 7th, 1969 (Twickenham Studios, London): While Let It Be director Michael Lindsay-Hogg tries to engage the band in discussion about their proposed concert/television special, Paul tries anxiously to talk to John (who has been wordlessly strumming his guitar for the past half-hour) about performing together onstage again. \r\n\r\nGEORGE: It would be nice – you see, uh, if we’re just singing these songs – for me to watch it, I’d be bored if it was, “Oh, haha, thank you, now we’d like to do…” and all that. Or if it was like just edited from – you know, clap clap, bam, and you know, like that, like they do those films, that would be better. \r\n\r\nPAUL: See, there is that possibility too, which is the one I originally thought this was going to be, actually. Which was not to have a documentary, but to have the show – have documentary and show, just intercut. But it’s not as good as – it’s half arsed. It’s two ideas in one, because neither of ‘em is good enough. \r\n\r\nMICHAEL: If it comes off – if this comes off, we’ve got great chaps, we’ve got a great entertainment package in an album, a documentary never seen before, and a performance. It’s a great package. \r\n\r\nGEORGE: Yeah, you know, I mean, a lot could come out of it if we could get the enthusiasm and the strength to do it. \r\n\r\nMICHAEL: See, I think that the truest thing is if we – if we get it together.\r\n\r\nPAUL: [upset; to John] I mean, I’ll – I’ll sing in a corner with Mal on the tour, or I’ll sit here, and I’ll – I’ll anything. ’Cause I – I enjoy it all. That’s the only thing I enjoy, actually. [inaudible; drowned out by George’s and Michael’s voices] It’s terrible just to – I mean, imagine if you – if you were the only one interested. And I’m not easing it in, easing it in right now. I know you’re interested in that. But you won’t say anything to me about it.\r\n\r\nJOHN: [long pause] I said what I’d been thinking. I would. And that is what I have. \r\n\r\nPAUL: [tired] Are you still thinking that now? What are you thinking now?\r\n\r\nJOHN: [evasive] I’m still thinking about it. [continues playing]\r\n\r\n### We – we haven’t played together, you see! That’s the fucking thing. But when we do come together to play together, we all just sort of talk about the fleeting past! We’re like old-age pensioners! “Remember the days when we used to rock?” You know, but we’re here now! We can do it, you know.\r\n\r\nJanuary 7th, 1969 (Twickenham Film Studios, London): An increasingly exasperated Paul yells into the immovable and unspeaking void despairs about everyone’s commitment to this project and to making music together in general, bemoans their seeming inability to communicate openly and honestly with one another (and resorting to using Neil Aspinall and others as a conduit), and fears the worst about the Beatles’ future if this continues. Mal Evans and filmmaker Michael Lindsay-Hogg insist that staying together would be good not just for the band itself but for the world at large. \r\n\r\nMICHAEL: ’Cause otherwise, there isn’t any point in doing it. I don’t mean – I don’t mean us copping out in any way. I just mean, we oughta make – if we’re gonna do it, we oughta make it… very good. Stop me when – stop me when I’m— [inaudible]\r\n\r\nPAUL: It’s like Mal said last night. “If you’re gonna do the show here, you’ve got to decide today.” And he sort of said it, almost frightened to say it, you know, to the lads. Didn’t really want to sort of shout at us. Didn’t want – but he had to say it, because if you do the show, you’re gonna have to decide today, you know, and it’s like that. And it’s like if you’re gonna do these songs, you’ve got to learn the chords. And we all know them. And we’ve got to learn the words. It’s just certain basic things that we’ve got to do, if we’re gonna do it. See, and as far as I can see there’s only two ways, and that’s what I was shouting about the last meeting we had. There’s only two things, you know. We’re gonna do it, or we’re not gonna do it. And I want a decision. Because I’m – I’m not interested enough to come to spend so many days farting around here while everyone makes up their minds about whether they want to do it or not, you know. I’ll do it. If everyone else will, and everyone wants to do it, then alright. [laughs bleakly] But it’s just a bit – a bit soft, you know? It’s—\r\n\r\nMICHAEL: The point is—\r\n\r\nPAUL: It’s like a school, you know, you’ve got to be here! And I haven’t. I haven’t, you know, I’ve… see, I’ve left school. We’ve all left school, and we don’t have to go. But it gets into a scene where you do have to go there.\r\n\r\nMICHAEL: No, you see the first thing to get together is yourselves, totally. And then we all follow with our kit bags and our campers.\r\n\r\nPAUL: So it’s like if we’re doing the show right now, we’re gonna have to work hard, and we’re gonna have to even think about how many songs that we’ll today have to have rehearsed, in order to by five days before it, to know ’em all. Now, five days before it is a week from now. And that means by the time a week from now comes, all these songs we’ve got, we’ve gotta know perfectly, and then [for] five days we’ll really, really get us to know it. You know, but I mean, there’s no – there’s no use to sort of waiting for the players themselves until we’ve got to put off the date and [inaudible] it to the cameras and say, “Don’t, we can’t have the cameras now.” [pause] It’s not like that, is it? [long pause] See, apathy’s alright, if— [inaudible; drowned out by George’s and George Martin’s voices] \r\n\r\nMICHAEL: [inaudible] —anyway.\r\n\r\nPAUL: That’s alright, it’s allowed. \r\n\r\nMICHAEL: Yeah, sure.\r\n\r\nPAUL: [inaudlble] —if it’s supposed to be opposite then you shouldn’t— [inaudible]\r\n\r\nMICHAEL: So it’s, “Everybody, pull your socks up”?\r\n\r\nPAUL: Sure it is, you know. Yeah I—\r\n\r\nMICHAEL: The first day was the best musical day, for me it was a musical day, yeah. Because you routined about four numbers. [long pause]\r\n\r\nPAUL: But I must say I’ll get, uh, put down, ’cause you know. Like if certain people aren’t interested, then I do… I lose interest. [long pause] And we can’t blame our tours or anything, or so on and so on and so on. [long pause] You see this one, that we’ve been having, this year, makes me really want to—\r\n\r\nGEORGE: Last year. Last year.\r\n\r\nPAUL: —snap out of it. Or snap into it. De-plastic it. But the past couple of months, you know, it’s been this, but the [White] album was like this, you see. The album was worse than this. This just seems sort of—\r\n\r\nMICHAEL: What, agony?\r\n\r\nPAUL: Well, just the whole idea of, do you want to do it? Do we want to do it? And that’s the joke, you see. After it all came about, Neil was saying to me we’d all phoned him individually, saying things like, you know, “Can you get ‘em together?” “Can you get it – oh, can you get it together?” “I want to know, what’re we doing?” You know. But like, instead of asking each other, we’ve all gone to Neil and asked him, “What’re the lads doing?” But you know, we should just have it out.\r\n\r\nGEORGE: But we keep coming up again, that one. And like you were saying, “Yeah well I’d like to do this, this, and that, yeah, and I’d like to do this, and I’d like to do that, and I’d like to do that,” and we end up doing something again that nobody really wants to do. [laughs]\r\n\r\nPAUL: Well then, you know, I think if this one—\r\n\r\nGEORGE: Make it public, at that.\r\n\r\nPAUL: Maybe it should definitely be the last for all of us. Because there just isn’t any point [inaudible]—\r\n\r\nGEORGE: Yeah, that’s it. [long pause]\r\n\r\nMICHAEL: I think I’d be sad. I mean, as an audience member, I’d be sad.\r\n\r\nPAUL: Of course it is! It’s stupid, you know! It is just stupid. But, it’s even more stupid the other way. To go through it. Because – you know.\r\n\r\nMICHAEL: I agree, but it’s—\r\n\r\nGEORGE: ’Cause this time we could be using for what you want to be doing—\r\n\r\nPAUL: You see, the thing is the people who are being stupid are the four of us. There’s nobody else. There’s only the four of us. You can’t actually, you know just sort of blame it on – ’cause there’s no other band, you know!\r\n\r\nGEORGE: —and being creative, instead of being like in the doldrums, which it always is now…\r\n\r\nMICHAEL: I wrote in my book, because I kind of keep a diary about what’s going on so I can cut it, and “doldrums” was the word I used. Because the doldrums have been coming, like – like to a ship on a [inaudible]—\r\n\r\nGEORGE: Oh, The Beatles have been in doldrums for at least a year.\r\n\r\nMICHAEL: You see, that is – that is terrible to say.\r\n\r\nPAUL: [desperate] We – we haven’t played together, you see! That’s the fucking thing. But when we do come together to play together, we all just sort of talk about the fleeting past! We’re like old-age pensioners! “Remember the days when we used to rock?” You know, but we’re here now! We can do it, you know. But I mean, I’m – all I hoping for is enthusiasm from you so—\r\n\r\nMICHAEL: That was – that was the idea—\r\n\r\nMAL: [earnest] I’d just like to say that you are needed, you know. The Beatles are needed. To so many people, you know.\r\n\r\nMICHAEL: Yeah, you’re right.\r\n\r\nMAL: Whatever you do.\r\n\r\nPAUL: You see the thing is also I – I get to a bit where I just sort of push all my ideas and I know that my ideas aren’t the best, you know. They are [mechanical voice] good, good, but they’re not the best, you know. But we can improve on it. Because we write songs together, and we improve on it. You know. [to Ringo] And you can improve on your drumming like it is, if you get into it. If you don’t, you know, okay, then I have better ideas, but if you get into it, you’re better! You know. It’s like that.\r\n\r\nGEORGE: And after all that, it’s like, you know, what do they say? It comes from a – and the eaves springs out of an E—\r\n\r\nMICHAEL: An ear.\r\n\r\nGEORGE: And that’s, you know, all that existentialist crap. [laughs]\r\n\r\nMICHAEL: Just like Jean-Paul, yeah, exactly.\r\n\r\nGEORGE: You know, it’s like…\r\n\r\nMICHAEL: You can call him John-Paul George, as opposed to Jean-Paul Sartre, you know. [laughs] We have a joke over here. You heard that, did you hear? Call him John-Paul George, as opposed to Jean-Paul Sartre, as a weird existentialism. [pause] Um, yeah. Like, it’s communication. And I think – I mean, see corny’s great, and like Mal said, it’s so corny that such a – I mean, he didn’t put it [as] corny, but it’s – you are terribly corny. [pause; scattered laughter] And that is what the world… [George starts singing ‘What The World Needs Now Is Love’] I mean really, ’cause – everyone in the world can say what they think except for you. We all need you. And you know, it’s the tears coming in the eyes of the little boy sitting in London as opposed to the little girl in America. And it’s communication. And it iss communication. And if you all can’t get it together, that’s really very sad. So, I feel what we should do now is let you play a little, and then you’ll have lunch together, and I can give you some more film, maybe. [pause]\r\n\r\nPAUL: Yes.\r\n\r\nMICHAEL: So, should we leave you for a while? I mean, if you—\r\n\r\nPAUL: Yes, yeah.\r\n\r\n### Maybe we should have a divorce.\r\n\r\nJanuary 7th, 1969: George talks about being treated like an equal, and in light of the worsening member relations, suggests The Beatles disband for good. \r\n\r\nGEORGE: Well, what I was saying about the songs was like, the reason, you know, like, I’ve got about twenty songs from 1948 was because I knew very well the moment I’d bring them in the studio, that – [blows raspberry] there it’s gone, you know.\r\n\r\nPAUL: Yeah.\r\n\r\nGEORGE: And, uh, so I never did. And, like, slowly now, I can bring a couple out because I can get it more like how it should have been then. And that’s – you know, it’s like, it’s just…\r\n\r\nPAUL: You see, but it doesn’t matter what’s going wrong. It really doesn’t matter what’s going wrong, as long as the four of us notice it.\r\n\r\nGEORGE: [disbelieving; laughs] Well, I’ve noticed it, alright. \r\n\r\nPAUL: No, but and – and – instead of just noticing it, determine to put it right, you know. [pause] ‘Cause that’s what I’m – that’s what I’m onto.\r\n\r\nGEORGE: Maybe we should have a divorce.\r\n\r\nPAUL: Well, I said that last week, you know. But it’s getting nearer.\r\n\r\nJOHN: Who’d have the children?\r\n\r\nPAUL: [pause] Dick James.\r\n\r\nJOHN: Oh, yeah.\r\n\r\n### You know me. We’re all – we’re all alike, here, us four. But we just don’t sort of get to talk it out with each other.\r\n\r\nJanuary 7th, 1969 (Twickenham Film Studios, London): A despairing Paul avows his own resolve to continue working and taking whatever challenge is offered (such as this prospective television concert/documentary project) for as long as it keeps the band going, and is baffled and dismayed by the others’ seeming ambivalence (if not outright aversion) to their current circumstances. He calls John out on his obtuseness and incapability to talk with him openly and honestly, and upon receiving no response, relents and admits that this criticism applies to himself as well.\r\n\r\nPAUL: ’Cause you know, that’s what I was telling you on the phone, that… I’ll do it. Just because it is so silly of us now, at this point in our lives, to crack up. It’s just so silly. Because there’s no point! We’re not going to get anywhere that we wanna get by doing that. The only possible direction is the other way from that, you know. [pause] You know. That is the only possible direction. But the thing is we’re all just theoretically agreeing with it and not doing it. [to John] You’re doing your bit through you and Yoko, you know, but it’s silly, you know, to sort of, uh, coming and talking down to us. Well, actually your way out is not to talk, rather than talk down to us, which you’d have to do, you’d think, but you wouldn’t be. And remember, I think I’m talking down to you, too. [pause] But, you know, we’re not! [laughs bleakly] You know me. We’re all – we’re all alike, here, us four. But we just don’t sort of get to talk it out with each other.  \r\n\r\n## 1/8\r\n\r\n### ‘Freer’, ‘queer’.\r\n\r\nJanuary 8th, 1969: George introduces ‘I, Me, Mine’ and plays it for Paul for the first time. Paul and Let It Be director Michael Lindsay-Hogg inform him on his phrasing.\r\n\r\nGEORGE: Uh, is that grammatic? “Flowing more freely than wine.”\r\n\r\nMICHAEL: Yeah.\r\n\r\nGEORGE: “Flowing much ‘freer’”? [pause] “Freer”?\r\n\r\nMICHAEL: “Flowing more ‘freely’.”\r\n\r\nPAUL: “Freely.” “Freer.”\r\n\r\nGEORGE: It’s funny in writing, yeah – thinking of how you say it—\r\n\r\nPAUL: “Freer.” For it’s sticky out here. [general laughter]\r\n\r\nGEORGE: But I was thinking, “freer” – if there was a such a word as “freer”, is it f-r-e-e-e-r—\r\n\r\nMICHAEL: No, it’s f-r-e-e-r, it’s f-r-e-e-r.\r\n\r\nGEORGE: “Free—”\r\n\r\nPAUL: Like “queer”, “freer”. [laughs] “Freer”, “queer”.\r\n\r\n### Two of us wearing postcards…\r\n\r\nJanuary 8th, 1969: John and Paul sing a rollicking version of ‘Two Of Us’ in the style of Elvis Presley. (An edited segment of this performance was later included and featured in the documentary-film Let It Be.)\r\n\r\n### I know that I can’t win but then / What can I do / You win again…\r\n\r\nJanuary 8th, 1969 (Twickenham Film Studios, London): John (with George accompanying on vocals) sings a strain of Hank Williams’ ‘You Win Again’.\r\n\r\nJOHN: The news is out all over town / That you’ve been seen out and around / I know that I can’t win but then / What can I do / You win again…\r\n\r\n### It sounds so hard to do. I mean, for you.\r\n\r\nJanuary 8th, 1969: George plays ‘I Me Mine’ to John for the first time. John snacks on food, opens Paul’s mail, and doesn’t pay much attention.\r\n\r\nJOHN: Is that the end of it?\r\n\r\nGEORGE: Yeah. It’s only that long—\r\n\r\nJOHN: We can use it for a commercial. [laughs; bored] So uh, yeah. It’s fine. And what do we do about that?\r\n\r\nGEORGE: Um, well, it’s just a bit – you see—\r\n\r\nJOHN: It sounds so hard to do.\r\n\r\nGEORGE: No, it’s… no.\r\n\r\nJOHN: I mean, for you.\r\n\r\nGEORGE: No.\r\n\r\nJOHN: [falsetto] I me mine… You know, all that singing.\r\n\r\nGEORGE: [starts playing again] All through the day, I me mine, I me mine, I me mine… All through the night, I me \r\nmine, I me mine, I me mine… No one’s frightened of leaving it, everyone’s weaving it, coming on strong all the time…\r\n\r\nJOHN: [operatic] I me my me my me my me my oh…\r\n\r\nGEORGE: All I can hear… [starts playing forcefully] I me mine – I me mine – I me mine…\r\n\r\nJOHN: All the girls can come on and dance it. Hari [Krishna]s and fisherwives, and dwarves, and hunchbacks…\r\n\r\nGEORGE: Even your tears, I me mine, I me mine, I me mine… No one’s frightened of playing it, everyone’s saying it, flowing more freely than wine…\r\n\r\nJOHN: [derisive] Run along, son. [laughs] See you later. We’re a rock ‘n’ roll band, you know. Bom bo bom bo bom bo bom bo bom…\r\n\r\n### When I’m up against the wall, Paul, you’ll find I’m on my best—\r\n\r\nJanuary 8th, 1969: After John dismisses all of the songs he’s come up with for the Get Back/Let It Be sessions, Paul asks John if he has written anything new to make up for it. He hasn’t. No one is thrilled about this.   \r\n\r\nPAUL: Haven’t you written anything?\r\n\r\nJOHN: [defiant] No.\r\n\r\nPAUL: [tense] Haven’t you. [pause] We’ll be faced with a crisis, you know.\r\n\r\nJOHN: When I’m up against the wall, Paul, you’ll find I’m on my best—\r\n\r\nPAUL: Yeah, I know, I know, but I just wish you’d come up with the goods.\r\n\r\nJOHN: Now, look. I think I’ve got Sunday off.\r\n\r\nPAUL: Yeah, well, I hope that you can deliver.\r\n\r\nJOHN: I’m hoping for a little rock ‘n’ roller.\r\n\r\nPAUL: [sarcastic] Yeah, I was hoping for the same thing, myself, you know.\r\n\r\nJOHN: [mocking] “Sammy loved his mammy, she hammy dammy dammy…” \r\n\r\n### I remember that on my sickbed in Bournemouth.\r\n\r\nJanuary 8th, 1969 (Twickenham Film Studios, London): George recalls the writing of ‘Don’t Bother Me’, the other Beatles’ high-chasing imbibing of George’s cough medicine, and a recent (re)encounter with poet Royston Ellis. \r\n\r\nGEORGE: [laughs] I remember that on my sickbed in Bournemouth. In fact, that’s what it was. You know I was in bed in Bournemouth, where we were on a summer season [laughs], and the doctor gave me some – some tonic, which had some amphetamine or something in it. Remember? And you all, like, drank it to get high. Just [inaudible] got you high. [inaudible] And that’s when I wrote that one. \r\n\r\n### I don’t think you’re dancing right, John.\r\n\r\nJanuary 8th, 1969 (Twickenham Film Studios, London): George leads a preliminary run-through of ‘I Me Mine’ and advises John and Yoko on their footwork. (Note: John and Yoko’s waltzing is featured in the Let It Be film documentary. George’s dance tips may or may not be passive-aggressive.)\r\n\r\nGEORGE: I don’t think you’re dancing right, John.\r\n\r\n### You stole into my heart like a creeping nun… My arteries were overwhelmed.\r\n\r\nJanuary 8th, 1969 (Twickenham Film Studios, London): An uneasy Michael Lindsay-Hogg tries to steer the band (or just Paul) back into discussing the logistics of their imminent televised concert and/or television documentary. Paul sings a strain of Carl Perkin’s ‘Your True Love’, and John improvises his own love song.\r\n\r\nJOHN: You stole into my heart like a creeping nun… My arteries were overwhelmed. \r\n\r\nMICHAEL: That would be pretty good like as a melody.\r\n\r\nJOHN: A malady?\r\n\r\n## 1/9\r\n\r\n### All the pleasure from the many ways I’ve tried\r\n\r\nJanuary 9th, 1969 (Twickenham Film Studios, London): With John and George yet to arrive at the studio, Mal and Ringo sit with Paul at the piano as Paul tries to figure out the lyrics for the middle-eight of ‘The Long And Winding Road’. \r\n\r\nPAUL: All the pleasure from the many ways I’ve tried / But still they… “I’ve had lots of pleasure but said better,” you know. “I’ve had many pleasure, I’ve had much much more pleasure…” The many times I’ve been alone / The many times I’ve cried…\r\n\r\n…\r\n\r\nMAL: Put “waiting here” and “standing there.”\r\n\r\nPAUL: Yeah, I was thinking of that. \r\n\r\n### A verse about getting drunk and a weight upon my head\r\n\r\nJanuary 9th, 1969 (Twickenham Film Studios, London): With John and George yet to arrive at the studio, Ringo sits with Paul at the piano as they chat about the origins of ‘Golden Slumbers’ and the originally intended music hall leanings of ‘Carry That Weight’. \r\n\r\nPAUL: That really should be like a fairy tale. “Once upon a time there lived a princess and…” Once upon a time / There lived a king / “Sleep pretty darling do not cry / And I will sing a lullaby.”\r\n\r\nMAL: [laughs] And the king will sing a lullaby. \r\n\r\n…\r\n\r\nPAUL AND RINGO: And this is why she said… She said, “Boy, you’re gonna carry that weight, carry that weight a long time…”\r\n\r\nPAUL: Like their troubles, all their troubles. But it was like a comedy when I heard it, you know. [starts playing jaunty piano] Boy, you’re gonna carry that weight / Carry that weight a long time…\r\n\r\n…\r\n\r\nPAUL: See, I think there might a verse about, I got drunk, I got in trouble with the wife, got drunk, so on and so on and so on, and it all goes to the next morning with a weight upon my head, and I found out it was my head. [laughs; starts playing jaunty piano] Boy, you’re gonna carry that weight / Carry that weight a long time… Just sort of normal kind of troubles that everyone has, and then just boy, you’re gonna…\r\n\r\n…\r\n\r\nPAUL: But it could be one of those things where, you know like in those songs where you’ve got everything, and everything’s going so great, but like, “This morning, one of my eggs broke,” you know. [laughs]\r\n\r\nRINGO: [laughs; plays piano] “The rabbit’s got away.”\r\n\r\nPAUL: [laughs] Just something trivial. \r\n\r\nMAL: “Broke a mirror.”\r\n\r\nPAUL: “My right shoe’s a bit tight.” Boy, you’re gonna carry that weight…\r\n\r\n### How’s it going to end?\r\n\r\nJanuary 9th, 1969 (Twickenham Film Studios, London): As everyone waits for John and George to arrive, Ringo, Mal, and director Michael-Lindsay Hogg listen as Paul tries to figure out the lyrics for the second verse of ‘The Long And Winding Road’. (Note: Mal’s reference to The Wizard of Oz reminds me of this interview he did in 1975 about him and Paul crying over John’s “I want a divorce” declarative.) \r\n\r\nPAUL: See I was thinking of having another – like the weather obstacle. \r\n\r\nMICHAEL: It’s beautiful. What’s it called?\r\n\r\nPAUL: ‘The Long And Winding Road’. [tries playing; falters] The only trouble is I always think of the… The storm clouds and the rain / Break up over the winding road… [trails off]\r\n\r\n…\r\n\r\nPAUL: I suppose it should still be about this sort of winding road. I’ve just got that picture – just the winding road that leads to your door, it will never disappear, I’ve seen that road before, it’ll always lead me here, lead me to your door. [audio feedback] Oh no!\r\n\r\nRINGO: [laughs] It’s a start.\r\n\r\nMAL: What you’re talking is sort of like The Wizard of Oz. Did you ever see The Wizard of Oz?\r\n\r\nPAUL: No no no, I didn’t, but I’ve—\r\n\r\nMAL: ‘The Yellow Brick Road’?\r\n\r\nPAUL: Yeah. I know. \r\n\r\nMAL: ‘The Long And Winding Road’. \r\n\r\nMICHAEL: It’s great. \r\n\r\nPAUL: You see, it’s also something… [starts playing again]\r\n\r\nMAL: It’s got that feel about it, you know? [inaudible] —so [Dorothy] gets back to, back to the boys— [inaudible] —and she’s never going to see them again.\r\n\r\nMICHAEL: Yeah, yeah, exactly. \r\n\r\nMAL: It’s a terrible feeling. \r\n\r\nMICHAEL: Heartbreaker, yeah. It’s great.\r\n\r\nMAL: It made me cry.\r\n\r\n…\r\n\r\nPAUL: It could be like the thing that’s up ahead. The thing that’s up ahead / At the end of the road… \r\n\r\nMAL: Like, how about like the obstacles on the road, that you’re going over?\r\n\r\nPAUL: No, but I think the obstacles – eh, you know. I have enough obstacles without putting them in the song. [laughs] \r\n\r\nMICHAEL: How’s it going to end? Is it going to end happily, or just – not sure yet? Is that the end?\r\n\r\nPAUL: No, it should end something like this. But still they lead me back / To the long and winding road / You left me waiting here / A long long time ago / Don’t leave me standing here / Lead me to your door…\r\n\r\n## 1/10\r\n\r\n### I think I’ll be leaving the band now\r\n\r\nJanuary 10th, 1969: Following an (unrecorded) argument with John in the Twickenham Film Studios lunch room, George returns to the studio floor and decides to leave The Beatles. (George then drives out of London, goes home to Liverpool, and writes ‘Wah Wah’.) \r\n\r\nGEORGE: —I think I’ll be leaving the band now.\r\n\r\nJOHN: When?\r\n\r\nGEORGE: Now. [audio cuts off]\r\n\r\n### Because they’re a songwriting team\r\n\r\nJanuary 10th, 1969: George has just left the studios after deciding to quit The Beatles;  George Martin, Neil Aspinall, and Let It Be director Michael Lindsay-Hogg discuss why. In the meantime, John, Paul, and Ringo jam through a dramatic, shrieking rendition of ‘It’s Only Make Believe’. (If you’re wondering: they’re a little drunk.) \r\n\r\nMICHAEL: The trouble is, once you leave, it’s very hard to come back.\r\n\r\nNEIL: Not really. We’ll all have to meet him on Sunday, anyway. So he could be back, then. No, really, the box that George is in is, um – it’s him versus John and Paul when it comes to what he’s got to do and what he has to play.\r\n\r\nGEORGE M.: And there’s the songwriting. Because they’re a songwriting team, and he’s – he’s his own team. And [inaudible] it’s tough. \r\n\r\nMICHAEL: Yes, but – John and Paul aren’t writing together much anymore, are they, really?\r\n\r\nGEORGE M.: No, but nevertheless, they’re still a team. \r\n\r\n### Eggs thrown at us in Australia\r\n\r\nJanuary 10th, 1969 (Twickenham Film Studios, London): While Paul wordlessly plays Samuel Barber’s ‘Adagio For Strings’ in the background,  director Michael Lindsay-Hogg, producer Glyn Johns, and Mal Evans chat about incidents on tour with the Beatles and the Stones, prompting John and Ringo to share their own memories of touring during the onset of Beatlemania.\r\n\r\nJOHN: [American accent] Oh yes. Why, I think of it every day. I think what fun we had, when we was The Beatles, playing and rocking, with the group around the world. I said, “Richard, you remember that?” And he says, “No, I hadn’t joined you then.” [laughter]\r\n\r\nRINGO: The hotels, I have very fond memories of.\r\n\r\nJOHN: [laughs] Yeah.\r\n\r\nRINGO: The tour, I’m not so fond of.\r\n\r\nJOHN: Having eggs thrown at us in Australia was one of my big moments.\r\n\r\nRINGO: I was away for a long time with tonsilitis. [laughs]\r\n\r\nJOHN: Ah, yes.\r\n\r\nMICHAEL: Who went out instead?\r\n\r\nRINGO: Bobby Nicol, Jimmie Nicol?\r\n\r\nMICHAEL: Jimmie Nicol?\r\n\r\nJOHN: Jimmie Nicol, who is now making a living as the twenty-ninth Beatle in New Mexico. [Michael laughs]\r\n\r\n### Mersey Beat Couple of the Year\r\n\r\nJanuary 10th, 1969 (Twickenham FIlm Studios, London): After George’s walk-out of the studios (and the band), Paul, Ringo, Maureen, Mal Evans, Neil Aspinall, George Martin, and Michael Lindsay-Hogg sit around telling each other knock-knock jokes and facetiously discussing the band’s forthcoming live concert/television special plans. John and Yoko (who have been in another room doing an interview) return to the studio when the group is reading the day’s spread of newspapers.\r\n\r\nGEORGE M.: Oh I do like to be beside the seaside…\r\n\r\nMICHAEL: So at the moment, how’s America looking? Where’s, uh—\r\n\r\nRINGO: America doesn’t… it isn’t nice at all.\r\n\r\nMICHAEL: Doesn’t look nice at all. [pause] Where’s he gone?\r\n\r\nGEORGE M.: John?\r\n\r\nMICHAEL: Four-eyes.\r\n\r\nRINGO: He’s most probably off painting somewhere.\r\n\r\nPAUL: [snorts] Yeah, yeah. Sketching.\r\n\r\nMICHAEL: Sketching, or writing a quick poem. Or a book. Or a diary.\r\n\r\nPAUL: Probably in a bag in his dressing room with Yoko, you know. [general laughter] They brought their own bag with ‘em today.\r\n\r\nMICHAEL: Hence the expression…\r\n\r\nGEORGE M.: “Papa’s got a—“\r\n\r\nMICHAEL & GEORGE M.: “—brand new bag.”\r\n\r\nGEORGE M.: Snap.\r\n\r\nMICHAEL: Snap. [laughs] “Papa’s got a brand new bag-snap.” Or a zip. So, uh… [long pause] The seven men are going out to Africa on Monday, right? [uproarious laughter] We’ve got a reconnaissance team.\r\n\r\nPAUL: Seven Zulus going to Willesden on Monday. [laughter] To check it out.\r\n\r\nMICHAEL: No, we keep adding all the time.\r\n\r\nPAUL: Or Paddington Town Hall.\r\n\r\nRINGO: A special hired jet Boeing 707 is taking a full haul to Constaninopole. To see what the weather’s like.\r\n\r\nMICHAEL: [laughs] And the show will be done in Ethiopia.\r\n\r\nRINGO: That’s a nice place. Did someone say that before?\r\n\r\nMICHAEL: Ethiopia? Oh, that’s my joke! Do you remember my joke of Haile Selassie?\r\n\r\nGEORGE M.: The Abyssinian?\r\n\r\nRINGO: Isn’t he Brazilian?\r\n\r\nMICHAEL: No, no – the punchline is “Haile Selassie”.\r\n\r\nRINGO: Then what’s the bit before?\r\n\r\nMICHAEL: And the bit before is, “Do you want to buy my tomatoes?” Do you want to buy my – it’s a queer Moroccan joke which I made up.\r\n\r\nRINGO: “Do you want to buy my tomatoes?” “Haile Selassie.” [laughs]\r\n\r\nPAUL: Very good joke.\r\n\r\nGEORGE M.: Did you tell it to anyone here? Have we heard it yet?\r\n\r\nMICHAEL: Well, some of them heard it on the first day, and rejected it. “Haile Selassie.” See, I thought it was a kind of nice rough trade, New York joke. “Haile Selassie.” But it goes through a list of things you would sell for money. [laughter] I find this very funny! I—\r\n\r\nRINGO: Do you want to buy my potatoes?\r\n\r\nMICHAEL: No.\r\n\r\nRINGO: Princess Margaret. [Michael laughs]\r\n\r\nPAUL: [inaudible]\r\n\r\nRINGO: Knock knock.\r\n\r\nMICHAEL: Who’s there?\r\n\r\nRINGO: Charlie.\r\n\r\nMICHAEL: Charlie who?\r\n\r\nRINGO: Elizabeth Harden. [long pause; general laughter]\r\n\r\nMICHAEL: I love knock-knocks. We were going to do one for the [Rock ‘n’ Roll] Circus, we were gonna have “Knock knock, who’s there?” and someone was gonna say, “That’s right.” And then, “What do you mean, ‘That’s right?’”\r\n\r\nRINGO: [in background; to Maureen] I stole it from you, my dear, I know that. [Maureen laughs]\r\n\r\nPAUL: [laughs] I don’t get it!\r\n\r\nRINGO: What?\r\n\r\nPAUL: “Charlie Elizabeth Harden”? [general laughter]\r\n\r\nMICHAEL: The “who”, the “who” is there.\r\n\r\nMAL: [laughs] That’s what you do!\r\n\r\nRINGO: “Michael.” “Michael who?” “Bill and Ben.” [general laughter]\r\n\r\nMICHAEL: I love knock-knocks.\r\n\r\nGEORGE M.: I like the song ones.\r\n\r\nMICHAEL: Who’s there?\r\n\r\nGEORGE M.: Knock knock.\r\n\r\nRINGO: Arthur. Is that?\r\n\r\nMICHAEL: Is that who?\r\n\r\nRINGO: Is that your Cornetto? [Michael laughs]\r\n\r\nMICHAEL: Hiawatha.\r\n\r\nRINGO: Hiawatha who?\r\n\r\nMICHAEL: Hiawatha good little boy till I met you.\r\n\r\nGEORGE M.: Knock knock.\r\n\r\nMICHAEL: Who’s there?\r\n\r\nGEORGE M.: It is Simon.\r\n\r\nMICHAEL: Simon who?\r\n\r\nGEORGE M.: Simon chanting evening… [general laughter]\r\n\r\nPAUL: [to John and Yoko?; Cockney accent] Get in your bag! Get in here boy and get in your bloody bag! Go on! [long pause; rustling; thick Northern accent] The Mersey Beat Awards for Couple of the Year goes to John and Yoko. [long pause] Irritant of the Year. [pause; nervous laughter]\r\n\r\nMAL: Is he the Irritant of the Year?\r\n\r\nRINGO: No.\r\n\r\nPAUL: Private Eye. On the paper.\r\n\r\nRINGO: Oh, that’s – I did see that, I apologise.\r\n\r\nPAUL: Lying again.\r\n\r\nRINGO: [referring to newspaper] See, I want that curly hair.\r\n\r\nPAUL: Yeah, great, isn’t it? Bernard Levin.\r\n\r\nRINGO: Bernard, that’s the one. I don’t want to say his name in case he sees me. [reading] “Yes, we’ve done it again!” says the Daily Mirror.\r\n\r\nPAUL: “Yes, they’ve done it again!” says the Daily Mail.\r\n\r\nRINGO: “Yes, we’ve—” [inaudible]\r\n\r\nPAUL: “Well, we’ve missed it again!” says the daily work. [bleak; laughs]\r\n\r\nMICHAEL: Would anybody like a cup of tea?\r\n\r\nRINGO: No thank you.\r\n\r\nPAUL: Yes, I’d like a cup of tea. With saffron.\r\n\r\n### Do we want to carry on The Beatles?\r\n\r\nJanuary 10th, 1969 (Twickenham Film Studios, London): In the aftermath of George’s walk-out of the studio and the band earlier in the day, John talks (sincerely or not) to Michael Lindsay-Hogg about letting The Beatles continue on as a group by simply replacing George with Eric Clapton, while Michael also talks idly with George Martin and the others about his chewing tobacco. In the background, Paul (who has been cushioning himself with a piano for the past hour, not speaking to anyone) plays ‘Martha My Dear’ on end, Yoko calls John’s name into her microphone in a similarly endless refrain, and the two seem to coalesce into an unusual jam.\r\n\r\nMICHAEL: I’ll check. [pause] Glyn! Glyn. Yoko wants a mic.\r\n\r\nJOHN: I think, uh, if George doesn’t come back by Monday or Tuesday, we ask Eric Clapton to play in it.\r\n\r\nMAL: [inaudible]\r\n\r\nJOHN: I mean, if George is leaving the group—\r\n\r\nRINGO: [inaudible] —then why did he leave the Creem group?\r\n\r\nJOHN: But no, Eric would be pleased if George— He left Creem because they’re all—\r\n\r\nRINGO: All soloists.\r\n\r\nJOHN: —all soloists. Were it not [inaudible] he’d have full scope to play his guitar. The point is, if George leaves, do we want to carry on The Beatles? I do. [inaudible; drowned out by mic feedback] And I’d just get another member of the group and carry on. But if The Beatles split, well, I’ll get another group. [to Paul and Yoko?] I’m a singer not a dancer, baby! Woo-hoo!\r\n\r\nMAL:\r\n\r\nPersonally— [inaudible] —do you really want to do it over here?\r\n\r\nRINGO: I don’t particularly want to do it with another Beatle, but I will.\r\n\r\nJOHN: Well hello there, Michael Lindsay Hogg.\r\n\r\nMICHAEL: We have a lot of shots of the empty seat, we can lay the dialogue over it like in two movie times.\r\n\r\nJOHN: We are?\r\n\r\nMICHAEL: [laughs] Maybe we’re not going to get very much. [long pause] You see, maybe for the show, you could just say George was sick.\r\n\r\nJOHN: No – I mean if he leaves, he leaves.\r\n\r\nYOKO: [in background] John… John… John…\r\n\r\nMICHAEL: But what’s the consensus? Do you want to go on with the show and the work?\r\n\r\nJOHN: Yeah. If he doesn’t come back by Tuesday, we’ll get Clapton in.\r\n\r\nYOKO: John… John… John…\r\n\r\nJOHN: What!\r\n\r\nYOKO: John!\r\n\r\nJOHN: [screaming] What!\r\n\r\nYOKO: John… John… John…\r\n\r\nJOHN: Yoko! Anything you say, dear! I brought the tea!\r\n\r\nYOKO: [screaming] John! John! John!\r\n\r\nJOHN: [screaming] Yes!\r\n\r\nYOKO: John?\r\n\r\nJOHN: Yoko.\r\n\r\nYOKO: John…\r\n\r\nJOHN: Yoko!\r\n\r\nYOKO: John…\r\n\r\nJOHN: Yoko!\r\n\r\nYOKO: John…\r\n\r\nJOHN: Stop that.\r\n\r\nYOKO: John… John…\r\n\r\nMICHAEL: We could get Ike or Tina Turner over.\r\n\r\nJOHN: Instead of George?\r\n\r\nMICHAEL: Yeah.\r\n\r\nYOKO: John… John… John…\r\n\r\nRINGO: I’m afraid he’s not in!\r\n\r\nYOKO: John! John! John!\r\n\r\nJOHN: He’s busy!\r\n\r\nYOKO: [screaming] John… John… John…\r\n\r\nJOHN: Yes?\r\n\r\nMICHAEL: What do the other lads feel?\r\n\r\nMAL: Broken. ‘Cause we want to feel what the lads feel.\r\n\r\nMICHAEL: About – just going on?\r\n\r\nMAL: Essentially.\r\n\r\nMICHAEL: Do it.\r\n\r\nYOKO: [screaming] John! John! John!\r\n\r\nJOHN: Bloody mad.\r\n\r\nMICHAEL: And then what about the venues, as they say in the rock ’n’ roll— [audio mutes] —it’s a funny thing to say, but if it’s… I don’t know, I was going to say if – if it is – if George comes back we go away, and if Eric comes in we stay here. But I think if – I think we should go away.\r\n\r\nJOHN: I think we should just go on, though.\r\n\r\nMICHAEL: I think we should go away.\r\n\r\nJOHN: As if nothing’s happening.\r\n\r\nMICHAEL: Yeah. I think we should go away.\r\n\r\nYOKO: John… John… John…\r\n\r\n## 1/13\r\n\r\n### (Morning) Starting from scratch with Yoko there\r\n\r\nJanuary 13th, 1969: After George’s departure from the band on the 10th (Friday), Paul, Linda, Ringo, and Neil Aspinall start their morning in the studio discussing a band meeting held at Ringo’s house over the weekend, where John’s willful deference to Yoko drove George to walk out of the room, leaving matters amongst the group unresolved. Neil reassures Paul and Ringo that George still cares about the band, and only wants to settle everything equally and honestly amongst the four of them, without any outsiders.\r\n\r\nAmidst everyone’s comments about Yoko’s over-involvement (ergo John’s recalcitrance), Paul admits that the protective seal the band formed around themselves over the years has made it difficult for them to regard anyone unfamiliar into their faction without some measure of hostility and paranoia - especially if they have been asserted into a creative and professional position equal to their own, as Yoko has by John.\r\n\r\nPAUL: Waiting for you, ooh… Why don’t you know… what it could be…\r\n\r\nLINDA: It’s a good thing if all four of you just got together – and nobody else. You know, it’s alright when we’re all just sitting around now.\r\n\r\nRINGO: Did you go last night, Neil?\r\n\r\nNEIL: Um – this is, um, just something I was talking to George about last night. And that was what he was saying, too.\r\n\r\nRINGO: What?\r\n\r\nNEIL: What he means. [About] just the four of you.\r\n\r\nLINDA: Yeah, it’s—\r\n\r\nNEIL: That’s what he means, you know. Nothing else.\r\n\r\nRINGO: Yes.\r\n\r\nPAUL: Yeah, I’m for that, you know.\r\n\r\nNEIL: So am I.\r\n\r\nRINGO: Yes.\r\n\r\nLINDA: It’s the only way you’re gonna—\r\n\r\nNEIL: That’s why he didn’t – that’s why he said, “I don’t believe you,” to John. Yesterday.\r\n\r\nPAUL: Yeah… Key moment, that, wasn’t it?\r\n\r\nNEIL: [wry] Yes. But he meant it. And I think John knew what he was talking about, too.\r\n\r\nPAUL: Oh, John. [laughter] Sure he did.\r\n\r\nNEIL: And that’s why George said it twice. When John said, “I don’t understand you, George,” and George said, “I don’t believe you. Forget it.” ‘Cause he thought [John] did understand him.\r\n\r\nPAUL: [unsurprised] Of course he did.\r\n\r\nLINDA: [wry] It was great.\r\n\r\nNEIL: You know, and it’s that. It’s like the bullshitting bit where, like, that can go on, is silly.\r\n\r\nPAUL: Yeah. But I think the thing is, like, we – John does bullshit, I bullshit, Ringo bullshits, George bullshits. You know, we bullshit. The problem is that it’s only John— [inaudible; Michael Lindsay-Hogg’s voice recording a phone call] —trying to be more influencing, and they’re thinking past it. And so you start to sort of give him more credit than he’s – than he’s due for, you know. And, like, with Yoko, you know – they’re real. They mean it.\r\n\r\nLINDA: [laughs] I don’t dig that, though.\r\n\r\nPAUL: Him and Yoko, you know, they – they—\r\n\r\nLINDA: [pretends to sneeze] Go away!\r\n\r\nPAUL: You know, they do mean it. But…\r\n\r\nNEIL: [playing along] Everybody cough. Heeueck.\r\n\r\nLINDA: [playing along] Heuuuueck go away. Heeueck.\r\n\r\nPAUL: [sober] You know?\r\n\r\nLINDA: [sincere] Yeah, I know what you mean. You know what you mean.\r\n\r\nPAUL: But you know, I – I tend to think that about them, too. Like I was saying, you know. “Well, I’d rather write without Yoko, thank you.” Just because it’s – that’s the way I write. If I – like, if I was in Tunisia, I’d go up to the bathroom to write a song, and then come back when it was done to show it to you. And to sort of say, “Let’s do a couple more words, now that’s it all there, you know, now that there’s only a little…”\r\n\r\nNEIL: Yeah.\r\n\r\nPAUL: But it’s difficult starting right from scratch with Yoko there, ‘cause you start off on a – well, I do. I start off on a Yoko beam, you know. I start off sort of writing songs about white walls. [laughter] Just ‘cause I – you know, just ‘cause I think she – John and Yoko would like that. And they wouldn’t, you know. I mean, I give them too much credit for – for what I think they’d like. But that’s not true. They wouldn’t. They’re very straight. […] I mean, you know, it’s just like—\r\n\r\nLINDA: It’s all about being away from each other, aren’t they?\r\n\r\nPAUL: I think it’s—\r\n\r\nNEIL: No, I don’t – I don’t think it’s that.\r\n\r\nRINGO: Did you get in touch with John?\r\n\r\nNEIL: Um, Mal did. This morning, in fact.\r\n\r\nLINDA: That was the answering service.\r\n\r\nRINGO: [to Neil] Oh, you guys – I thought you were, later on. [Ringo thought Neil contacted John after the band meeting, the previous night.]\r\n\r\nNEIL: I couldn’t get him.\r\n\r\nRINGO: No?\r\n\r\nMICHAEL: Is he join – is he joining us?\r\n\r\nRINGO: We don’t know.\r\n\r\nNEIL: I suppose [John and Yoko] might, but nobody can expect as much.\r\n\r\nRINGO: ‘Cause Mal couldn’t get him either, you know. He may be up now.\r\n\r\nNEIL: So – nobody’s spoken to him?\r\n\r\nRINGO: No no no. You can only get the machine. So someone should try again.\r\n\r\nNEIL: [inaudible] But nobody’s answering it.\r\n\r\nLINDA: [to Paul] Yeah, but it’s hard having a meeting, and everybody putting their two cents in and none of you all saying – anything.\r\n\r\nPAUL: But that’s the other thing, having the meeting, you know. You came with me, and Heather came, and the animal—\r\n\r\nLINDA: Yeah, I was going to say I shouldn’t go, but then…\r\n\r\nPAUL: Yeah… [lighthearted] It’s such a temptation going out to Ringo’s for the afternoon.\r\n\r\nLINDA: [laughs] Exactly.\r\n\r\nRINGO: [bemused] What?\r\n\r\nLINDA: Heather could play with Zak.\r\n\r\nPAUL: It feels like a family outing. [Ringo laughs] Don’t really just want to go on my own.\r\n\r\nLINDA: [sheepish] Yeah, I was going to say, “We really shouldn’t go,” but then I thought – well.\r\n\r\nRINGO: Why?\r\n\r\nLINDA: Well, it should’ve been—\r\n\r\nPAUL: Well, it should have been the four of us, you know.\r\n\r\nRINGO: Oh— [to Linda; reasonable] Well, you were out of the way.\r\n\r\nPAUL: Oh, yeah, sure.\r\n\r\nLINDA: Sure.\r\n\r\nRINGO: I mean— [inaudible]\r\n\r\nLINDA: Oh yeah, but you know, it’s just like…\r\n\r\nPAUL: It’s – it’s still, it’s that thing, you know.\r\n\r\nRINGO: Mm.\r\n\r\nLINDA: When there’s something serious, and you have other people there talking about it, you get off the track.\r\n\r\nPAUL: You know, it really is – it really is like a board meeting going on.\r\n\r\nRINGO: [mock-stern; to Linda] If you would’ve just kept quiet, it could’ve all gone well.\r\n\r\nLINDA: [playing along] Well, I had to talk every two minutes. [laughs]\r\n\r\nPAUL: Ol’ Sir Joberry and his wife…\r\n\r\nRINGO: [playing along] Damn Yankee. [laughter]\r\n\r\nPAUL: You know, but that’s it. It’s like that. The board meeting with ICLI, and all the government bringing all the wives, [laughs] and mates, and kids, and animals – and everything.\r\n\r\nNEIL: But it turns – it turns into— [inaudible]\r\n\r\nLINDA: Well, Yoko is doing all the talking.\r\n\r\nNEIL: But that’s – that’s the point, you see. You know that he’s going to, and you know that Yoko’s going to be sitting there, and so everybody else is like, “Fuck it.” You know it’s not going to be a [proper] board meeting, so…\r\n\r\nPAUL: Yeah, right.\r\n\r\nNEIL: “Let’s make it a party.”\r\n\r\nPAUL: Sure, that’s – that, really, that—\r\n\r\nLINDA: But she does so much talking for [John], now.\r\n\r\nPAUL: But see, now, so what do you do about that? That’s what I was saying about songs, yesterday, you know. I’m – I know that if – to write any more with John, I’ve just gotta, like, figh– [faltering] you know, forget it.\r\n\r\nLINDA: But I think that whole—\r\n\r\nPAUL: See I think it’s – it’s us, uptight about that. I really do – I think, uh…\r\n\r\nLINDA: The king.\r\n\r\nPAUL: See, it’s like – the trouble with us – like, John said it yesterday – it’s like, anything that comes up on all of our little egos, we try and push out. And anybody – it’s always been that. Anybody who’s come in, like Michael Braun – who was writing that book – came in for a while, within the circle for a while, but then he gets pushed out. ‘Cause, you know, we don’t want him in the inner circle. He’s got to stay on the edges, while the four of us get on with – you know.\r\n\r\n(Note: As suggested above, John and Yoko are late to the studio - which is not uncommon, as far as the entire sessions are concerned, but this time no one is even sure they’re going to show up, especially when George isn’t here, and rehearsals aren’t likely to progress. It is later discovered that they had disconnected their phone lines; when they finally get through, after more than a hour, it’s only because John calls the studio first. It may or may not be significant that John calls specifically to speak to Paul - and after speaking with him, decides to come to the studio after all.\r\n\r\nIt is the popular opinion - and indeed, the members themselves have claimed the same - that George initially quit the band following a tense exchange with Paul. Definitively, however, George actually quit following an unrecorded argument with John; that oft-discussed scene between George and Paul from the Let It Be documentary happened four days before the fact. Which isn’t to say that Paul is any less responsible for George’s emotional state than John is; there had already been years of interpersonal band dynamics before Yoko ever got into the picture. That John was determined not to speak for himself, and considered Yoko’s opinion above George’s in matters related to the band, was probably a tipping point.\r\n\r\nYoko speaking on behalf of John has the further implication of passive-aggressive inaction on John’s part - at this time, he didn’t want to be actively involved in the band anymore; he didn’t want to forfeit his symbolic position as a “leader” of having the final say, but he didn’t want to be the bad guy and call it off, either. Hence the entitled deference and exchangeability and establishment of symbiosis, to oust the old out with the new - until the boat called Paul sank, and he could set sail on the boat called Yoko.)\r\n\r\n### She was talking for John\r\n\r\nJanuary 13th, 1969 (Twickenham Film Studios, London): During a morning discussion of John and Yoko’s conduct and its unnerving impact on the Beatles, Linda offers her observation of what was (and wasn’t) communicated by John and Yoko during a tense band meeting held the previous night. (Note: Follows shortly after this audio clip. Re: the band meeting, I would recommend listening to that as well as this other audio clip for more context.) \r\n\r\nLINDA: ’Cause I have a feeling that half the stuff Yoko said yesterday isn’t – I mean, she was talking for John, and I don’t think he really believed any of that, you know.\r\n\r\n### Two answers: fight her, or accept she’s there\r\n\r\nJanuary 13th, 1969: As everyone waits for John and Yoko to arrive at the studio, Paul talks about John’s uncommunicativeness, and how he uses it as a defense to avoid speaking honestly or decisively about his own feelings. While Paul is convinced that Yoko provides something for John that The Beatles (read: Paul) can’t anymore, and hedgingly defends the couple to do what they will, the others suggest John doesn’t really want to sever his partnership with Paul, either.\r\n\r\nNEIL: I’d just rather not say anything. It’s one of those situations. \r\n\r\nPAUL: Yeah. [pause] Well, that’s – that’s the trouble you see, there, ‘cause that’s it. It’s like, with our – heightened awareness, the answer is not to say anything, you know. But it isn’t. ‘Cause I mean, we screw each other up totally if we don’t do that. ‘Cause we’re not ready for your heightened… vows of silence. [laughs; hapless] We’re really not! Like, we don’t know what the fuck each other’s talking about, when that – we all just sort of get—\r\n\r\nNEIL: I think it’s just between the four of you, that get it. That’s what I’d pretend. \r\n\r\nPAUL: Oh yeah, right, yeah. But you see, that’s it, that’s why John doesn’t say anything. ‘Cause he, you know, he just… There was something the other day, when I said, “Well, what do you think?” And he just stood there and didn’t say anything. And then – and I know exactly why, you know. I mean, I wouldn’t, if… [long pause] Somehow. You know, there’s nothing really much to be said about it. You just – we all just have to do it, and all that, instead of like talking about it. But – but if one of us is talking about it, it’s a drag if the other three aren’t. Because then it sort of throws you off. [inaudible; voice marking tape slate] I mean, we’ve just been talking about it now for a few years, you know. Like this… \r\n\r\nMICHAEL: How long has this been around? Like a year? \r\n\r\nLINDA: But that’s not it, anyway. It’s the four of them just getting together. \r\n\r\nPAUL: [hesitating] But that’s – that’s not far off it, you know. I mean…\r\n\r\nLINDA: What?\r\n\r\nPAUL: I mean, Yoko’s very much to do with it.\r\n\r\nLINDA: Mm.\r\n\r\nPAUL: ‘Cause she’s very much to do with it from John’s angle, that’s the thing, you know. And I – the thing is that I – there’s— Again, like, there’s always only two answers. One is to fight it, and fight her, and try and get The Beatles back to four people without Yoko, and sort of ask her to sit down at the board meetings. Or else, the other thing is to just realize that she’s there, you know. And he’s not gonna sort of – split with her, just for our sakes.\r\n\r\nAnd – but then it’s not even so much of an obstacle, then, as long as we’re not trying to surmount it. And while we’re still trying to get over it, it’s an obstacle. [trying] But it isn’t, really. It’s not that bad, you know. They want to stay together, those two. So it’s alright. Let the young lovers stay together. [pause] But it shouldn’t be, “We can’t operate under these conditions, boy. You know, we’re coming out.” It’s like – it feels like we’re striking. That’s what it is. It’s like a strike, ‘cause work conditions aren’t right, you know. But… it’s not that bad. \r\n\r\nMICHAEL: But, he – he knows that, doesn’t he?  \r\n\r\nPAUL: John knows that, sure. But he’s—\r\n\r\nMICHAEL: Does he talk about it at all?\r\n\r\nPAUL: No. But he’s – I mean, he’s— See, we’ve done a lot of Beatles now, we’ve had a lot of Beatles, you know, and we’ve got a lot out of Beatles. So that it – I think John’s saying now that honestly, if it came to a push between Yoko and The Beatles, it’s Yoko, you know. \r\n\r\nMICHAEL: Who’d stay. \r\n\r\nPAUL: Oh, sure. \r\n\r\nMICHAEL: But funny enough, the other day, when we were talking, he said that he really did not want not to be a Beatle. He said he really looked forward – not, you know. Meaning he didn’t want that screwed up. \r\n\r\nPAUL: Hm. [pause; unconvinced] Yeah, but it’s a difficult one, that, you know. \r\n\r\nLINDA: I think in their discussions, though, when as soon as you brought that up, John turned to her and said, “See, I told you.” I think it’s one of those things where he—\r\n\r\nPAUL: They do it. They tell each other, you know, when they get back home— \r\n\r\nLINDA: Yeah, but I bet he said to her, you know, “When I write, just sort of go away, when I’m with Paul.” But she said, “Oh, I don’t know…” [trailing off] It’s that kind of thing.\r\n\r\nPAUL: [quiet] I don’t know. \r\n\r\n(Note: Paul is certainly right, here, but that doesn’t discredit Linda’s or Michael Lindsay-Hogg’s views. John’s unwillingness to declare the dream is over has as much to do with still wanting Paul to come round to his side, as with John’s own insecurities and preternatural connive. But the breakup is inevitable no matter what anyone does, and John’s reticence is double-edged - with Paul, now desperately overreaching, prime to take the fall either way.)\r\n\r\n### I’m all for that, but if it screws everything up\r\n\r\nJanuary 13th, 1969: While waiting for John and Yoko to arrive at the studio, Paul explains (to Let It Be director Michael Lindsay-Hogg) why it’s difficult for him to get round to talking to John alone anymore, without Yoko around.\r\n\r\nLINDA: I think he’d do it but I don’t think she’d do it.\r\n\r\nPAUL: See, but their point is, they’re – they’re trying to be as near together as they can. \r\n\r\nMICHAEL: For their own truth, and everything jazz.\r\n\r\nPAUL: Yeah, for everything like – so that if she sits over here, then it’s just slightly less good than if she’s sitting that near, very near to him. And if she’s touching him, then that’s even better, you know. And it’s like that. So that, okay, she’s prepared to sit here, but that’s – then there’s the beginning of the rock down. Then she’ll stay at home the next day, while he comes [to the studio], you know. And they see it like that. They see it that the more that they can stay together – and it’s right, in a way. I – you know. If that’s how you see it, then you can see that it would be a drag for that  for people to start saying, “Well, come to the meeting without her,” you know, “I’d rather talk without her,” ’cause it starts separating you again, from her. Which is like, see, it’s very ideological. Which is, you know, it’s probably how it should be.\r\n\r\nMICHAEL: I’m all for that. I mean, if that’s what they want to do. But then if it screws everything up for everybody else, then they’ve got to think about it.\r\n\r\nPAUL: [reserved] Well. I don’t know, you know. You see, they – they’d say that the other way, that—\r\n\r\nMICHAEL: That you’d have to adjust to them.\r\n\r\nPAUL: [weary] —that the other way is true, yeah. You know, that if they do what we want to do, then it might screw it up for them, you know. And they don’t want to be screwed up.\r\n\r\n### Tell him he’s on pins and needles\r\n\r\nJanuary 13th, 1969 (Twickenham Film Studios, London): After waiting for John (and Yoko) to arrive for over an hour, Neil Aspinall returns to inform Paul that their continued attempts to call John have been unsuccessful. This prompts filmmaker Michael Lindsay-Hogg to make an uncharitable joke about removing Yoko to solve John’s unresponsiveness (John letting Yoko speak for him even during band meetings being one of the topics Paul, Linda, Neil, Ringo, and Michael have been discussing all morning). Paul wonders darkly if John has followed George’s example and gone on strike. (Note: Follows directly after this audio clip.) \r\n\r\nNEIL: Mal’s trying to ring him.\r\n\r\nPAUL: Yeah?\r\n\r\nNEIL: We found [the phone] engaged.\r\n\r\nPAUL: Found engaged?\r\n\r\nNEIL: [inaudible] —they have it off the hook. \r\n\r\nPAUL: Mm.\r\n\r\nRINGO: Send him a telegram.\r\n\r\nLINDA: Tell him [Paul]’s on pins and needles, wondering what’s happened to him. [Paul laughs bleakly] Yeah, I thought of that last night, sending him a telegram.\r\n\r\nMICHAEL: Did anybody speak to him last night? Does that—\r\n\r\nNEIL: No, it was the same last night.\r\n\r\nMICHAEL: Maybe if [Yoko] stayed in the black bag, that would count as— [inaudible; drowned out by voice marking tape slate] But not talking. [laughs] Putting that lid on the parrot’s cage. [long pause; Paul whistling; Michael sighing]\r\n\r\nPAUL: … And then there were two. [laughs]\r\n\r\n### Writing a song with him is a bit embarrassing\r\n\r\nJanuary 13th, 1969: As Paul and Neil Aspinall discuss John and Yoko’s persistently conjoined state and how difficult it is to speak with John on a personal level, Paul brings up a failed attempt to write ‘I Will’ alone with John - and Yoko. While Paul contends that Yoko didn’t interfere with them at all, he admits that the very fact of her being there affected his ability to work and engage with John. Deflecting, Paul maintains that he is no position to tell John what he can or can’t do within their partnership, and explains that they’ve been falling out of tandem with each other since The Beatles stopped touring. (Note: This dialogue follows directly after this post.)\r\n\r\nLINDA: I don’t know, but that’s what I—\r\n\r\nNEIL: Yes, I think a lot of people get to have the impression that whenever John talks these days, it’s like, oh – Yoko’s talking to [for] him.\r\n\r\nPAUL: Yeah. \r\n\r\nNEIL: Or he shuts up, and that’s it, he doesn’t do it for you. And then that becomes a dream. [inaudible]\r\n\r\nPAUL: Sure. \r\n\r\nNEIL: Not ever, like, talking to him – like I’m talking to you now. Like now I’m talking to Paul, I’m not talking to Linda. \r\n\r\nPAUL: Right. \r\n\r\nNEIL: But when you’re talking to John, you always – these days, anyway – tend to think that you’re talking to Yoko more than you’re talking to John. And that’s when it becomes a drag. \r\n\r\nPAUL: [furtive] That’s why I say writing a song with him is a bit embarrassing, because I do think it sort of – I mean, I start examining my motives, with Yoko there… And it’s probably silly of me! It’s probably silly, because like, Yoko’s not what we’re all sort of thinking she is. \r\n\r\nNEIL: You see, I wouldn’t mind if she would just… wouldn’t say as much. Otherwise.\r\n\r\nPAUL: [weary] Well, that – of course that would be great, you know.\r\n\r\nNEIL: [laughs; bleak] Yeah. ‘Cause I just feel that it’s like – it’s you and John that are writing the songs together. You know, I mean, I’m not, I’m not— [inaudible; Linda’s and Ringo’s voices]\r\n\r\nPAUL: Yeah. \r\n\r\nNEIL: It’s just like, that – she’d start interjecting that you’d… hurt him, and—\r\n\r\nPAUL: Yeah, no, she would—\r\n\r\nNEIL: But you know, she probably wouldn’t—\r\n\r\nPAUL: No, she isn’t—\r\n\r\nNEIL: But that’s – you know.\r\n\r\nPAUL: Yeah, see, that’s the thing. The only one time we’ve actually done it, she’s agreed. She really is alright. It’s like, it’s the thought of her being there when some of—  [faltering] And then you don’t talk to John, so then he doesn’t talk to you, you know. And it’s like, you can screw it up just as much because she’s there, as – as John’s relying on her because she’s there. So that’s the thing. You know, but I mean, like, you’ll notice, if John – if you’re onto a beam with John about something, then he really isn’t, you know, he really won’t let Yoko talk about it. Because he knows when you’re on a beam, and he knows about it, and you’ll – you can talk straighter to him.\r\n\r\nBut it’s like, we did ‘I Will’. We tried, we were trying to get the last verse to ‘I Will’, and eventually I just ended up doing it, because it – we couldn’t actually do it. [pause; trying] But – I mean, Yoko really tried to stay out of it, [and] just sort of – got on with something, but she just really… you know. They’re onto that thing. They just want to be near to each other. So I just think it’s just silly of me, or of anyone, to try and say to him, “No, you can’t,” you know. It’s like, ‘cause – okay, they’re – they’re going overboard about it, but John always does! And Yoko probably always does. So that’s their scene. You can’t go saying – you know, “Don’t go overboard about this thing. Be sensible about it. Don’t bring it to meetings.” It’s his decision, that. It’s – it’s none of our business, to start interfering in that. Even when it comes into our business, you still can’t really say much, unless – except, “Look, I don’t like it, John.” And then he can say, well, “Screw you,” or, “I like it,” or, “Well, I won’t do it so much,” or blablabla. Like, that’s the only way, you know. To tell John about that. \r\n\r\nMICHAEL: Have you done that already? \r\n\r\nPAUL: Well, I told him I didn’t like writing songs… with him and Yoko. \r\n\r\nMICHAEL: Were you writing much more before she came around—?\r\n\r\nPAUL: Oh yeah, sure. \r\n\r\nMICHAEL: Or had you – cooled it a bit, then? Before her.\r\n\r\nRINGO: Before Yoko got there.\r\n\r\nPAUL: [restrained] Yeah, cooled it, cooled it. Sure. We’d cooled it because… not playing together. Ever since we didn’t play together—\r\n\r\nMICHAEL: Onstage, you mean. \r\n\r\nPAUL: Yes. With the band. Because we lived together, and we played together. We were in the same hotel, up at the same time every morning, doing this all day. And this – I mean, this, you know, it doesn’t matter what you do, [but] just as long as you’re this close all day, something grows, you know. In some ways. And when you’re not this close, only, just physically… something goes. \r\n\r\nMICHAEL: Right.\r\n\r\nPAUL: So then you can come together to record, and stuff, but you still sort of lose the… [hesitating] Actually, musically, you know, we really – we can play better than we’ve ever been able to play, you know. Like, I really think that. I think, like – [laughs; bleak] we’re – we’re alright on that. It’s just that – being together thing, you know. \r\n\r\n(Note: Projections abound. Also note that John and Paul had in the past written several songs together in the crowded witness of rowdy tour vans, studios, et al, with no difficulty whatsoever - making Paul’s indefinable unease with Yoko’s presence all the more curious for what it implies. In direct relation to John, whatever Paul recognises of himself and his feelings is reflected back at him by Yoko, forcing him to confront these feelings in an explicitly manifested form. Paul’s consequent inability to write in the face of the matter is no wonder, then - especially for a musician whose lifelong efficiency in the writing process relies on steering very well clear of any introspective navel-gazing. And whose most arguably expressive lyrics are ingenuous efforts directed towards someone other than himself.\r\n\r\nIt is unspecified when this particular writing session for 'I Will’ took place, but if John, Paul, and Yoko were entirely on their own, sans engineers, producers, etc., it is possible it occurred in Paul’s house, where John and Yoko were residing for a time in 1968. \r\n\r\nAs for what Paul and Neil are intimating about earlier on, and whether they’re only speculating from their impression of how Yoko feels about John and Paul’s partnership, or actually recalling something said outright in a past incident - my guess is as good as yours. It seems to echo Yoko’s cruelly-timed 1981 comment to Philip Norman: “John said that no one ever hurt him the way Paul hurt him.”) \r\n\r\n### Yoko talked for John\r\n\r\nJanuary 13th, 1969: As everyone waits for John and Yoko to arrive at the studio, Paul talks disconsolately about John’s evasiveness, and how John’s habit of using Yoko as his mouthpiece drove George to walk out of a band meeting the previous day. Linda, Neil Aspinall, and Let It Be filmmaker Michael Lindsay-Hogg share their thoughts.\r\n\r\nMICHAEL: But do you think if you put any, uh, pressure on him, that he’d – go your way a bit more?\r\n\r\nPAUL: [guarded] Who’s this?\r\n\r\nMICHAEL: John.\r\n\r\nPAUL: I don’t know. [long pause] But I don’t know, you know, I can’t… [quiet] I just can’t be bothered doing all that.\r\n\r\nMICHAEL: Hm. [awkward] Hm. [silence; fidgeting]\r\n\r\nPAUL: [tired] Do you want to try and ring John? [long pause]\r\n\r\nNEIL: Mal or I can do it.\r\n\r\nPAUL: Try him.\r\n\r\nLINDA: The thing is, the four of you. The four of them just talking. \r\n\r\nMICHAEL: Did you – did you not talk about it much, last night?\r\n\r\nLINDA: Well, there was just too many…\r\n\r\nNEIL: People.\r\n\r\nLINDA: Mm.\r\n\r\nPAUL: John didn’t talk. You see, Yoko talked… for John.\r\n\r\nMICHAEL: Did George stay?\r\n\r\nPAUL: Oh, well, then – in the middle of all that, actually—\r\n\r\nLINDA: Hopefully. [Linda thought Michael was asking if George, who quit the band on January 10th, had decided in the meeting to stay in The Beatles.]\r\n\r\nPAUL: George went. You know, “See ya.”\r\n\r\nLINDA: But he was waiting for it to stop, you know. That’s why he was stepping out. But when he saw it wasn’t… The thing is like – a meeting without Yoko, just once, and she’d—\r\n\r\nNEIL: I don’t think we’ll ever get that. [long pause]\r\n\r\nPAUL: You see, that’s it, you know.\r\n\r\nNEIL: That is.\r\n\r\nPAUL: That is a big sort of crunch, that.\r\n\r\nNEIL: You’d have to – you’d have to say it to John, then. And then it’s going to be like, “Well, I’m not doing it,” or, “I am doing it,” and whichever way it goes – but at least whenever John decides what he wants with that, that will be that.\r\n\r\n### (Lunchtime) I really don’t like to be smothered\r\n\r\nJanuary 13th, 1969 (Twickenham Film Studios, London): Over lunch, the remaining Beatles touch on George’s resignation from the band on the 10th, as well as a group meeting held the previous day which ended in less than desirable circumstances (with George leaving the room, frustrated by John’s persistently Yoko-filtered standard of communication). While Yoko contends that it would be easy for John (and Paul) to regain George’s favour, John points out that this is a more deeply-rooted issue than it may seem, compounded over the years by John and Paul’s treatment of George and his defaulted status within the group. Upon this problem of overriding egos, however, Paul suggests (passive-aggressively) that it isn’t just the Lennon-and-McCartney tandem that is causing George upset and consternation. \r\n\r\nPAUL: [bleak; joking] So where’s George?\r\n\r\nRINGO: It smells like George is here. \r\n\r\nYOKO: [to John] Well, you can get back George so easily, you know that. You know, Paul and—\r\n\r\nJOHN: But it’s not that easy, because it’s a festering wound—\r\n\r\nPAUL: Yeah. \r\n\r\nLINDA: Yeah. \r\n\r\nJOHN: —that we’ve allowed to – and yesterday we allowed it go even deeper, but we didn’t give him any bandages. And it’s only because George, uh, when he comes up, when he is that part of him… We have egos. We can’t help but have—\r\n\r\nRINGO: Well, it can be a burden on him. \r\n\r\nJOHN: I’ll have, you know—well, look, you do— [inaudible]\r\n\r\nRINGO: [inaudible]\r\n\r\nPAUL: Rosé.\r\n\r\nYOKO: Can I have one too [inaudible]? But if you wanted it badly enough, you have to, you know—\r\n\r\nMAL: What do you want, uh, Paul?\r\n\r\nPAUL: Rosé, please, for me. Linda?\r\n\r\nLINDA: No thank you.\r\n\r\nJOHN: [inaudible] I wouldn’t say it’s my ego. It was yesterday, really – or, or even the day before when we went to George’s—\r\n\r\nPAUL: I sure as hell know I wouldn’t like you to.\r\n\r\nJOHN: What?\r\n\r\nPAUL: Dig in your heels.\r\n\r\nYOKO: Your ego’s great, by the way. \r\n\r\nPAUL: ’Cause if I’m to – if I’m to look at either of you, you know, I really don’t like to be smothered. You know—\r\n\r\nYOKO: No, no no—\r\n\r\nPAUL: You know, if I could – if you were in a shop on a shelf, I’d— [inaudible] —or whatever it is—\r\n\r\nJOHN: I’m just trying to ask [inaudible] – do I want him back, Paul, I’m just asking, do I want it back? Whatever it is.\r\n\r\n### Do I want him back?\r\n\r\nJanuary 13th, 1969 (Twickenham FIlm Studios, London): As the problem of George’s current resignation from the band is discussed, John makes it about him and Paul wonders what it’s all worth. (Note: As my transcripts for this tape undergo constant revision and it’s been an ongoing agony trying to determine who is addressing whom about what in reference to whom throughout this tape under a deluge of possible interpretations, this fragment - which follows right after this previous post - is about all I’m confident with sharing at the moment.) \r\n\r\nJOHN: I’m just trying to ask [inaudible] – do I want him back, Paul, I’m just asking, do I want it back? Whatever it is. [Do I want it back] Enough?\r\n\r\nYOKO: Right, do you want this, to have George back, you have [inaudible]—\r\n\r\nJOHN: Then if it is enough, I’d have to swallow my ego for you, I’d have to smother me jealousy for you—\r\n\r\nPAUL: Mm. \r\n\r\nJOHN: —to carry on for whatever reasons there is. \r\n\r\n### I’ve always played that one\r\n\r\nJanuary 13th, 1969 (Twickenham Film Studios, London): John contends with how the force of his partnership with Paul and his relationship with Yoko has negatively affected George and perhaps directly contributed to George’s walkout on the group three days prior. (Note: Follows shortly after this clip. My apologies for the vagueness; this is a very difficult excerpt to interpret, and I change my mind about it constantly, as the emotional nuances of what is being conveyed shift significantly depending on whom you presume John is speaking to (Paul or Yoko) about whom (Paul, George, or Yoko) and whom it is in reference to or is directed towards (Paul, George, or Yoko), word to word. I did initially try to indicate who’s who in brackets next to the relevant pronouns, but the transcript got dreadfully cluttered, and as I said, I have hardly nailed myself to a mast. Basically, this is a fannish Rorschach test and Your Mileage May Vary.)\r\n\r\nJOHN: And it’s just that, you know. It’s only this year that you’ve suddenly realised, like who I am, or who he is, or anything like that. But the thing is—\r\n\r\nPAUL: But I still haven’t realised that. What I’m – the process.\r\n\r\nYOKO: [inaudible]\r\n\r\nJOHN: Yeah yeah, but you realise that some – like you were saying, like George was some other part. But up till then, you’d had a – your thing that carried you forward. [pause; Yoko speaking?] I know, I’d adjusted before you. Alright, that would make me hipper than you, but I know that I’d adjusted to you before that – for selfish reasons, and for good reasons, not knowing what else to do, and for all these reasons. I’d adjusted to all these and allowed you [inaudible] – you know, if you wanted to let me— [inaudible] —very, very… whatever it is. But this year, you’ve seen, you’ve seen what you’ve been doing, and what everybody’s been doing, and not only did we feel guilty about it, the way we all feel guilty about our relationship to each other, because we could do more… \r\n\r\nYOKO: [inaudible]\r\n\r\nJOHN: I know, the thing is that I’m – I can’t – I’m not putting any blame on you for only suddenly realising it, see, because it’s [inaudible] our game, you know; it might have been masochistic, but the goal was still the same, self-preservation. And I knew what I liked about that. I know where the – even if I didn’t know where I was at, you know, the table’s there, and… let him do what he wants, and George too, you know…\r\n\r\nPAUL: I know. I know—\r\n\r\nJOHN: And I have won.\r\n\r\nPAUL: But this thing has been—\r\n\r\nJOHN: But I think you—\r\n\r\nPAUL: You have—\r\n\r\nJOHN: I feel it’s you.\r\n\r\nPAUL: Whatever it is, you have. Yeah, I know. Well, I’ve had [inaudible]—\r\n\r\nJOHN: Because you – ’cause you’ve suddenly got it all, you see.\r\n\r\nPAUL: Mm.\r\n\r\nJOHN: I know that, because of the way I am, like when we were in Mendips, like I said, “Do you like me?” or whatever it is. I’ve always – uh, played that one.\r\n\r\nPAUL: [laughs nervously] Yes.\r\n\r\nJOHN: So.\r\n\r\nPAUL: Uh, I’d been watching, I’d been watching. I’d been watching the picture.\r\n\r\nYOKO: Go back to George. What are we going to do about George?\r\n\r\nJOHN: Yeah, I’m – yeah, sure. But this year, suddenly, it’s all happened to you, and you sort of go – you’re taking the blame, suddenly, as if, uh… Oh, he’d say, “Oh yeah, you know [inaudible],” as if I’ve never known it. And then he thought, “Fucking hell. I know what he’s like. I know he used to kick people. I know how he connived with Len, Ivan. I know him, you know? Fuck him.” And then, oh, but, but right, I’ve done such things… all that. So you’ve taken the five years that [inaudible], you’ve taken the five years of trouble, this year. So half of me says, alright, you know I’ll do anything to save you, to help you. And the other half of me says, well serves him fucking right. I’ve chewed through fucking shit because of him for five years, and he’s only just realised what he was doing [to her?]. So, and that’s something – we’ve both known it, you know? [laughs] And it is incredible. [pause]\r\n\r\nPAUL: Yeah.\r\n\r\n### Like you joining the band instead of Pete\r\n\r\nJanuary 13th, 1969 (Twickenham Film Studios, London): During a discussion on how the rest of the group should move forward after George’s departure on the 10th, John wonders if they should get George back at all, suggesting his role as a Beatle is replaceable (unlike his own or Paul’s), and likens this unkindly to how Ringo first replaced Pete Best. Paul notes that John has been the top buck in getting himself heard (and getting his way) since the inception of the group (which John protests) and quickly reassures Ringo when he wryly declares himself to be little more than rabbit food for the group.\r\n\r\nPaul admits that both he and John have done one over on George, albeit unconsciously as an effect of the competition and unaware of how it may have hurt George in the process, but John argues that he’s known since early childhood how manipulative he himself can be, and has tried to curb it to little avail.\r\n\r\nPAUL: See, I’m just assuming he’s coming back, you know. I tell you, I’m just assuming he’s coming back.\r\n\r\nRINGO: If he wants—\r\n\r\nJOHN: What if he isn’t?\r\n\r\nPAUL: If he isn’t, then… if he isn’t, then it’s a new problem.\r\n\r\nRINGO: He would like the four of us to sit down.\r\n\r\nJOHN: It’s like we’ve said—\r\n\r\nPAUL: Yeah.\r\n\r\nRINGO: He wants the four of us to actually—\r\n\r\nJOHN: See, if we want it – if we do want it, I still won’t tour, man, but I do want to—\r\n\r\nPAUL: But you seem to – you seem to think—\r\n\r\nJOHN: But if we do end up deciding we want it, as a policy, I can go along with that. Because the policy has kept us together.\r\n\r\nRINGO: But the thing is that if we want him—\r\n\r\nJOHN: If we want him, because we want him – but the thing is, like George said, it’s that The Beatles, to me, isn’t just limited to the four of us. I think that I, alone, could be a Beatle. [to Paul] I think you could. [to Ringo] I’m not sure whether you could, because you’re doing… Well, like, but I’m just telling you what I think! I don’t think The Beatles revolve around the four people! It might be like a job—\r\n\r\nPAUL: But you know what, John, I’ll tell you one thing—\r\n\r\nJOHN: [to Ringo] It’s like you joining the band instead of Pete. It’s like – to me, it is like that.\r\n\r\nPAUL: Tell you what— [inaudible] Let me tell you what I think. [pause; inaudible] —thing is this. [to John] You have always been at the front of the chute. Now, there have been some secondary rungs, but George has been third rung—\r\n\r\nRINGO: And I’ve been the cabbage.\r\n\r\nPAUL: [immediately] Never.\r\n\r\nJOHN: [dismissive] No, we haven’t—\r\n\r\nPAUL: No, just, no – listen here. You’re the rabbit, he’s right.\r\n\r\nJOHN: But not always, though—\r\n\r\nPAUL: [anxious] No, listen here – listen – always! But! But! [pause] I do think – no, I do think that as grim as it all is, that [George]’s right. And I do think that like our sole approach is exactly what he’s been saying. And that our brains sort of… con him. It’s all nothing. I do think that is a – I mean— [stumbling] As a first way out, I can’t really even say that, but I do think, you know, that when you get right down to it—\r\n\r\nJOHN: Yes.\r\n\r\nPAUL: ’Cause the moments of clarity, that I’ve just been – are just so innocent, and so simple, that all my connive, and all my – urge, or— [inaudible]\r\n\r\nJOHN: But don’t give me like – ’cause I’ve at least been aware of my conniving since fourteen. Real aware of it.\r\n\r\nPAUL: Sure.\r\n\r\nJOHN: And before that. You realize that I’ve known I’ve been conniving from – from Dovedale, you know that. I’ve been aware of that. Just because – I don’t know whether it’s him. It’s not him. It’s just me. That I’ve realized where it’s nowhere – but the thing is, I only know where it is when I’m in the middle of all of it—\r\n\r\nPAUL: Yeah.\r\n\r\nJOHN: —that I am sort of at it again. And that’s why I’ve had to fight for the last three years. And I’ve done it – the other way. Just – rather than allow myself to connive, I thought, “Stop it now. Stop it.”\r\n\r\n### I want you all for whatever you are\r\n\r\nJanuary 13th, 1969 (Twickenham Film Studios, London): In the middle of a personal discussion with John and Ringo about the band, its tenuous future, and their relationships with one another, Paul (in response to John’s admission of insecurity in the face of external pressures from the public and media to perform) is emphatic about his faith in them and their abilities and contends that whatever interpersonal problems they have can be resolved, for what their music is worth. (Note: I am sheepishly and frustratedly uncertain of my transcription. And yes, Yoko and Linda seem to be having a fascinating conversation about Paul and George.)\r\n\r\nPAUL: [trying] If all of you were for sale on a shop, I’d want you as, you know, that, but I really don’t want you as that!\r\n\r\nJOHN: Yes.\r\n\r\nPAUL: But I want you as that! I don’t want him as that. You see, I want you to want yours. You’re [inaudible]. Ringo wanted— When I say those things, you know, I can hear myself sort of – but I don’t know what it is you want me to do! In period and in fact, I want you all for whatever you are. Because I’m placing it – after all the bests, and all it bloody does, and what’s best, is that what you are is alright. Because if it isn’t, then it’s just stupid of me [inaudible], you know? Because it’s what you are, and I would [inaudible] anywhere! So I’m placing all the money, all the fame, and everything, on what you are. So if this is what you two are, then get on with it.\r\n\r\n### It doesn’t give me the same satisfaction anymore\r\n\r\nJanuary 13th, 1969 (Twickenham Film Studios, London): While Yoko and Paul conduct their own conversation with each other, Linda talks to John about the inevitable difficulties any relationship faces - even in the context of a musical partnership - and why it doesn’t prove the relationship itself is an expired one. John (inexplicably or not) laments the the White Album doesn’t sound like the genuine, inspired band collaboration they achieved in the past. \r\n\r\nLINDA: You were saying that—\r\n\r\nJOHN: [pained] It’s like George said. It just doesn’t give me the same sort of satisfaction anymore. Because of the compromise we’d have to make, to be together. [long pause] You know, it’s that the end result of the records now aren’t… enough. Because now, we – we know it so clearly, how we arrived at it, and for what it was and all. Before, it was always a surprise when we – you know. We weren’t so aware of how we reacted to it. When the – something came out, like Revolver or Pepper or whatever, there was still that element of surprise that we didn’t know where it came from. But now we know exactly where it came from, and how we arrived at that particular noise, and how it could have been… much better. Or it needn’t have been at all. The only way to do it – satisfactory, for y– yourself – is to do it on your own. And then that’s fucking hard.\r\n\r\nLINDA: But you were saying yesterday, you know. And you know something, you – you’ve always been sort of thinking that it can’t be any better than it was; you’re not just a studio musician. You always say it. I mean, [inaudible] – I’m saying, hey, you make good music together. And you like it or not, you know.\r\n\r\nJOHN: [furtive] I like it.\r\n\r\nLINDA: And making good music is also—\r\n\r\nJOHN: But it’s just—\r\n\r\nLINDA: It’s really hard working at a relationship.\r\n\r\nJOHN: I – I know.\r\n\r\nLINDA: Of course! That’s what you said yesterday. It happens all the time, you know. And you also said you wanted [inaudible] The Beatles—\r\n\r\nJOHN: It’s like all of us are dissatisfied with The Beatles LP. Now, it’s not because the way we got on doing it, because the end result was – was as good as it could’ve been. And – I don’t know what the reason could be. [offhand] Mal, could you get a little glass of wine?\r\n\r\nMAL: Yeah. Red, or—?\r\n\r\nJOHN: If I get down to my contributions, then I’m satisfied, you know. But the whole thing is less satisfactory.\r\n\r\nRINGO: But I enjoy it more.\r\n\r\nJOHN: But individually. Name any of them! There is no [inaudible]. Even George’s numbers are more satisfactory than any numbers we’ve done before. But as a whole thing, it’s just not satisfactory to me.\r\n\r\nRINGO: Well, I mean, I dig it far more than Sgt. Pepper or anything—\r\n\r\nLINDA: You know, it really—\r\n\r\nJOHN: And I dig it too. I dig it, individually, far more than Sgt. Pepper. But as a whole – as a Beatles thing, I think it didn’t – it couldn’t work as a Beatles thing. I think it’s one of the best Beatles work we could have, you know, but as a – as an entity, as a whole coming out of all of us here – no.\r\n\r\n### You’re unsure whether to go left or right\r\n\r\nJanuary 13th, 1969 (Twickenham Studios, London): As Paul encourages an unconfident Ringo to go ahead with his plans to record a solo LP, John hedgingly brings up his own apprehensions about following his instincts (especially when he’s not even sure what he really wants to do). In their inimitable and emotionally non-committal fashion, John and Paul engage in metaphors about intentions, conveying these intentions in actions, and how these actions may be conveyed by those who see it. (Basically: what John and Paul talk about when they talk about love.)\r\n\r\nPAUL: [to Ringo] The great thing is that you singing like how you really sing – will be it. It will be! \r\n\r\nRINGO: Yes, but the only way is to do it on your own. \r\n\r\nPAUL: Until then – yeah, sure. Until then – until you reach how you really sing, you’ll sing your half-soul. \r\n\r\nRINGO: Yeah. \r\n\r\nPAUL: And it’s probably when we’re all very old, that we’ll all sing together. \r\n\r\nRINGO: Yeah.\r\n\r\nPAUL: And we’ll all really sing, and we’ll all show each other how good we are, and in fact we’ll die, then, I don’t know. [Linda laughs; diffident] Probably, you know, probably something sappy or soft like that… I don’t know, but really, I mean, i– it’s really down to all those sort of simple, silly things to me. \r\n\r\nYOKO: But those are the important things, you know. \r\n\r\nPAUL: It’s got to be simple. It’s got to be simple. It can’t be A plus B equals X plus Y plus Z, because that’s them, you know. And it couldn’t be— \r\n\r\nJOHN: [quiet] Maybe that’s what’s evading me. \r\n\r\nPAUL: Yes. [sincere] But it’s okay, that, you know. \r\n\r\nJOHN: [hesitating] I just, uh… because I’m not really sure what or how I feel about it. \r\n\r\nPAUL: No, but you’re—\r\n\r\nJOHN: Because any time— \r\n\r\nPAUL: You’re unsure because you’re not sure whether to go left or right on an issue. You’ve noticed the two ways open to us. You know the way we all want to go. And you know the way you want to go. Which is positive! ‘Cause you want to go – now, okay. So your positive thing might actually be to kick that telephone box in. It might occasionally be to do that. So you know that’s the way you’ve gotta go.  \r\n\r\nYOKO: Everybody would want to see that, actually.\r\n\r\nPAUL: But you don’t want to actually look like you’re kicking the telephone box in. So you have to sort of say to everyone, “Look at that over there, everyone!” And while they’re not looking, you’ll kick the telephone box in, and sort of— [whistles innocently] \r\n\r\nJOHN: I don’t think that’s a fair representation. [laughs] \r\n\r\nPAUL: [conceding] Oh, well, it involves me, that’s me. I do that, too. And I think we all do that. But I think the answer is, that – while you’ve got us all looking at nothing over there, and you’ve thrown us for a minute, we would actually all have dug to see you kick that telephone box in.  Because we wanna see you do it. \r\n\r\nYOKO: But we’d have to say it too, though. That’s another thing. \r\n\r\nPAUL: We would actually want to watch the Steve McQueen film, where he kicks the telephone box in. We all want to see that. You know. And I really think that’s—\r\n\r\nYOKO: Yes, but sometimes it’s very—\r\n\r\nJOHN: But it must be our own faults, that we’ve built it up that I can’t kick the telephone box – apart from it being my fault— \r\n\r\nPAUL: You can. You could. \r\n\r\nJOHN: But – the feeling that, that – that I – like Ringo said about his album, that what – we’re – you know. I won’t do it, ‘cause I’m gonna let us down, or – look a fool. \r\n\r\nPAUL: Yeah.\r\n\r\nJOHN: You know, and we’ve each done that to each— [audio glitch] That bit. \r\n\r\nPAUL: We all know we can do that, you know. I mean, I’m really trying to sort of learn, really— [inaudible] —meaning.\r\n\r\nJOHN: Well, it’s like – we’ve all found – we can do it on our own. \r\n\r\nPAUL: But on our own, I’m just gonna have to sort of just say it to you all. Through the song. Now I know if I – when I’m saying to you all, “Listen, this is how this song goes,” you know, then I know if I half-tell you how it goes, that there’ll be two of you who’ll like it, and then there’s only [inaudible]. You know. \r\n\r\nJOHN: Yeah. \r\n\r\nPAUL: A certain amount of you will like it, and some of you won’t. Because, and I know – and you know, this is where it gets heavy. Because you’ve got to blame yourself, for that. Because I know I half-sang it. \r\n\r\nJOHN: Yes. \r\n\r\nPAUL: And I know that if – say I’m pissed, at the end of an evening, and I just, and I get on a piano because I really just want to get on a piano. And I’m singing because I don’t particularly want to show off, too. I want to really sing this song, now, and say what I wanna say, and so on and so on and so on. I’ll do it, and everyone in that room will dig it, because it’s me really doing it. And I know that we all have this. [inaudible] And everyone will be really crazy about it. Now if I were really doing it, everyone will listen, and everyone will dig it, and no one will go against it. It’s when I half-mean it, or it’s when I nearly mean it, but there’s – there’s always that one person that can spot that – that—\r\n\r\nJOHN: Yeah.\r\n\r\nPAUL: Spot them doing a mistake. You know, there’s always someone who can spot that little bit where Charlie Chester didn’t quite mean it, or Charlie Drake, when he didn’t quite mean the joke. You know, it’s all in that.\r\n\r\nYOKO: But then sometimes it doesn’t matter to you, so. \r\n\r\nPAUL: It’s like if we could really… See, that’s why I think this is where we’ve got a problem now, you know.\r\n\r\n(Note: Significant - and frustrating, and hilariously sad - in hindsight, for reasons that are obvious. Paul: “I’m telling you to leave me in the hopes that you’ll tell me you won’t, because it’ll prove you still care about me and want to stay.” John: “I’m telling you I’m moving on in the hopes that you’ll tell me not to, because it’ll prove you still care about me and want me to stay.”)\r\n\r\n### How much more have I done towards helping you write?\r\n\r\nJanuary 13th, 1969 (Twickenham Film Studios, London): John and Paul have an obfuscating conversation about their songwriting partnership and creative process, which has been incapacitated by a lack of direction, misplaced (misread) intentions, and the unmet (unrealised) expectations they’ve inflicted upon each other. (In other words: issues. And some projecting of issues onto George, for good measure.)\r\n\r\nPAUL: That’s why I think this – we’ve got this problem now, you know. What I’d like to do, is for the four of us – and you know, we’ve all have done [inaudible] things – to different degrees, I see it as you go one way, you go one way, George goes one way, and me another. But I know it will apply to all us, if one day, we can all be singing like we’re singing, [to Ringo] you can be drumming like you’re drumming, George can be really playing – I mean, like he plays, not as if I’m trying to make him play like me. But now it’s like I keep trying to make him play like – how I’ve played guitar—\r\n\r\nJOHN: But you don’t, you see. The point – the point that we both – or, mainly me—\r\n\r\nPAUL: Back up, back up.\r\n\r\nJOHN: Yeah, okay. Is that you try and make George play… competently, because you’re afraid that how he’ll play won’t be like you want him to play. And that’s what we did. And that’s what you did to me. [pause]\r\n\r\nPAUL: Yeah.\r\n\r\nJOHN: And – I – that’s the difference with you saying that the competen— [audio glitch] —so annoyed by the conniving on The Beatles album, was that I’d—\r\n\r\nPAUL: Yeah.\r\n\r\nJOHN: I got to a bit where I thought – it’s no good, me telling you what or how to do it, you know? All I tried to do on that album was just sing it to you like I was drunk, you know.\r\n\r\nPAUL: Yeah.\r\n\r\nJOHN: Just did me best to say, “Look, this, this stands up on its own.”\r\n\r\nPAUL: Yeah.\r\n\r\nJOHN: And I’m not doing this quite well, ‘cause I – like even with ‘Don’t Let Me Down’, the first time I sang it. Because I hadn’t allowed meself to say it, as a whole song.\r\n\r\nPAUL: Yeah.\r\n\r\nJOHN: I couldn’t work – it was only after we’d done it that I’d realised  it was done. You know, and on The Beatles album, I just sort of said, “[inaudible] This is me singing it drunk, but I’m pretending as if I’m not. What would you do with it?”\r\n\r\nPAUL: [laughs] Drunk.\r\n\r\nJOHN: You know? “George, you play whatever you like.”\r\n\r\nPAUL: Yeah.\r\n\r\nJOHN: You know, and that’s what it was. It wasn’t – it wasn’t the arrogance of, “Listen. This is it, baby.” It was that – I can’t tell you what to do because you won’t play, here, like how I think you should play.\r\n\r\nPAUL: Yeah, right.\r\n\r\nJOHN: And—\r\n\r\nPAUL: You see, that’s – that’s the thing.\r\n\r\nJOHN: I’m not going to tell you what to play—\r\n\r\nPAUL: That seems to be the trouble, is that—\r\n\r\nYOKO: It is. [pause]\r\n\r\nPAUL: Okay. And that’s great, you know. And then – it’s just that being able to say that, on the occasion. I just mean to say, “Look, I’m not going to say anything about the song, because – really, I’m going to really try, now—”\r\n\r\nJOHN: But we tried it—\r\n\r\nPAUL: “—to sing it to you—”\r\n\r\nJOHN: [exasperated] Yeah, I know, but you wouldn’t say—\r\n\r\nPAUL: Listen to me— [inaudible]\r\n\r\nJOHN: We arranged it, you know?\r\n\r\nPAUL: I know, I know.\r\n\r\nJOHN: You can’t see— Listen, uh, you— [inaudible]\r\n\r\nPAUL: I say that, of course, when [inaudible] when you say that to me, because I haven’t got it off of you.\r\n\r\nJOHN: Yeah, but the point is you—\r\n\r\nPAUL: And you’ve sort of – I think—\r\n\r\nJOHN: Well, I’m saying that ‘Dear Prudence’ is arranged. Can’t you hear bom, bom, bom, bom, bom…?\r\n\r\nPAUL: Yeah.\r\n\r\nJOHN: That – that is the arrangement, you know.\r\n\r\nPAUL: Yeah, well.\r\n\r\nJOHN: But I’m too frightened to say “This is it,” I just sit there and say, “Look, if you don’t come along, and play your bit, I won’t do the song,” you know? I can’t do any better than that. Don’t ask me for what boogie you’re gonna play on it.\r\n\r\nPAUL: Yeah.\r\n\r\nJOHN: Because… apart from not knowing, I can’t tell you better than you have, what grooves you can  play on it. You know, I just can’t work. I can’t do it like that. ‘Course I could, you know! But when you think of the other half of it, just think: how much more have I done towards helping you write? I’ve never told you what to sing, or what to play.\r\n\r\nPAUL: Yeah.\r\n\r\nJOHN: You know, I’ve always done the numbers like that. Now, the only regret, just for the past numbers, is when – because I’ve been so frightened, that I’ve allowed you to take it somewhere where I didn’t want—\r\n\r\nPAUL: Yeah.\r\n\r\nJOHN: —and then – my only chance was to let George [audio glitch] take over, or interest George in it, because I knew he’d—\r\n\r\nPAUL: Like ‘She Said, She Said’?\r\n\r\nLINDA: Yes, yes.\r\n\r\nJOHN: ‘She Said, She Said’. Then he’d – he’d– ’cause he’d take it as is. You know? [inaudible; drowned out by voice marking] So on that last album— [inaudible] —arrangements on it— [inaudible] —it’s probably George, you know. If there’s anything wrong with it. Because I don’t want your arrangement on it. I only want your… If you give me your suggestions, let me reject them, or in the case there’s one I like – it’s when we’re writing songs.\r\n\r\nPAUL: Mm.\r\n\r\nJOHN: The same goes for the arrangement. I don’t want it – to… [sighs] I don’t know.\r\n\r\nPAUL: No, I know. I know what you mean, yeah.\r\n\r\nYOKO: I know exactly what you mean.\r\n\r\nPAUL: Yeah, yeah—\r\n\r\nJOHN: I want it to be like I’m just doing it, but— [audio cuts off]\r\n\r\n### I don’t hear any of the flutes playing\r\n\r\nJanuary 13th, 1969 (Twickenham Studios, London): In the midst of a personal discussion about working together within the band, John tries to explain the disconnect in their process, and why he can’t envision their songs the way Paul can. As both John and Paul circle around the issues of honest communication and (living up to) each other’s expectations, they eventually project onto George bring George into the quandary of the Lennon-McCartney partnership. \r\n\r\nJOHN: And that’s all I did on the last album was say, “Okay, Paul, you’re out to decide where my songs are concerned, arrangement-wise.” [exasperated] I don’t know the songs, you know. I’d sooner just sing them, than have them turn into – into ‘Mr. Kite’, or anything else, where— I’ve accepted the problem from you that it needs arrangement. And then, because I’m an ape, I don’t know. I don’t see any further than me, the guitar, and the drums, and – and George Martin doing the— [audio glitch] I don’t hear any of the flutes playing, you know? I suppose I could hear ‘em if I sat down and worked very hard! I could turn out a mathematical drawing if you’d like, but I could never do it off me own backside, I always have to just – [brushing sound from strumming motion] do that, you know?\r\n\r\nPAUL: Yeah. \r\n\r\nJOHN: I mean— \r\n\r\nPAUL: [quiet] Yeah. Yeah. [pause] I’m onto the same thing, you know. That’s – that’s – we’re all at that. It is only, like, if you can just remember that we’re – you know. That the four of us are trying to do that. Because I mean, all of those things you say, you know, in some way, apply to me. Not all ways—\r\n\r\nJOHN: Yes, yes, because everything applies a little bit to you, too.\r\n\r\nPAUL: [inaudible] —it is just you saying it. They’re all – you know, in some way, to some degree, will apply to me. \r\n\r\nJOHN: ‘Cause once there was a period where none of us could actually, uh, say anything, about your criticisms. \r\n\r\nPAUL: [quiet] Yeah. Yeah.\r\n\r\nJOHN: [bleak] ‘Cause you would reject it all.\r\n\r\nPAUL: [quiet] Yeah, sure. \r\n\r\nJOHN: And so George and I would just go – you know, “I’ll give you a line here,” “Okay,” you know, “We’ll do four in a bar, and I’ll do…” And a lot of the times you were right.\r\n\r\nPAUL: Yeah. \r\n\r\nJOHN: But a lot of the times you were – [the songs were] the same as they always are. But I can’t see the answer to that.\r\n\r\nPAUL: No, but – no, that’s good you see. The thing is, like, within each other, within ourselves, we reach something that’s nearly perfect. And everyone else who’s listening will think, “That’s it. They’ve got it.” You know – you know what I mean. So okay, we know we nearly made it, but we’ve really made it, for everyone else. ‘Cause it’s okay, we’re into the fine, finest, finest technicalities – I mean, that’s where it’s at, you know. If one day, we can even keep all – if all the people who are listening to this, nearly nearly made it, they’ll think we’ve made it, you know. They’ll think that’s it. So okay, if we can nearly, if we can creep up on it – and that’s, see, that’s what I’m trying to do. Like last week, yesterday [inaudible] doing alright for me, I was really trying to just say to George, “Take it there,” you know, whereas I wouldn’t have gone [inaudible] and said, “Take it there – with diddle-a-diddle-a-da.” But I was trying last week, to say, “Now, take it over there, and it needs to be like – but, oh, what, like, whatever you—”\r\n\r\nJOHN: You see, the point is now – George – is we both did that to George, this time.\r\n\r\nPAUL: Mm.\r\n\r\nJOHN: And because of the build up to it, that – now he can’t even take that. \r\n\r\nPAUL: Treating him a bit like a mongrel, yeah. \r\n\r\nJOHN: He can’t even – you know. [audio glitch] It’s like if I say, “Alright, take it,” he’ll say, “Well, look, I can’t take it. I’ll forget it.”\r\n\r\nPAUL: Yeah…\r\n\r\nJOHN: I have to, uh—\r\n\r\nPAUL: ‘Cause he knows what we’re all about.\r\n\r\nJOHN: Yeah.\r\n\r\nPAUL: So he knows that when we say, “Take it,” we expect doo-doo-duh-duh-doo. If I said that, then you’d expect—\r\n\r\nJOHN: But it’s just that bit. The bit where we’ve – ‘I’ve Got A Feeling’.\r\n\r\nPAUL: Yeah.\r\n\r\nJOHN: We – there’s no way we could have translated it to him, to say… you know. \r\n\r\n## 1/14\r\n\r\n### ‘The Back Seat Of My Car’\r\n\r\nJanuary 14th, 1969 (Twickenham Film Studios, London): Paul plays work-in-progress ‘The Back Seat Of My Car’ for the first time in the studio.\r\n\r\n### It’s just for you that I sing this song each morning\r\n\r\nJanuary 14th, 1969 (Twickenham Film Studios, London): Paul sings a song he’s written (or is simply improvising on the spot) in the spirit of Johannes Brahms’ ‘Hungarian Dance No. 4′ (and which was quite probably inspired by the 1947 film Song of Love, which features the piece). \r\n\r\nPAUL: It’s just for you that I sing this song of winter / It’s just for you that I sing a song of spring / And every time the raindrops fall I think of summer / It’s just for you that I sing a song of love. \r\n\r\n### Disillusioned by the church\r\n\r\nJanuary 14th, 1969 (Twickenham Film Studios, London): While John and Yoko are being interviewed by CBC, a bored Paul decides to have a go at climbing the chain/rope equipment in the studio. Ringo and Mal do likewise. When John and Yoko return, Paul encourages John to have a go as well; John bemoans that he’s too old, and starts in on interviewing Paul and Ringo in a humorous imitation of the interview he just had. (Note: John and Yoko return at around the 8:05 mark, for those who’d prefer to skip all the banter and faffing about with equipment.)  \r\n\r\nPAUL: Okay, John. Right up the chains, to the top. \r\n\r\nJOHN: Alright, Paul!\r\n\r\nPAUL: Come on, son, you can do it, son, I know you can do this, lad. [John attempts to climb] \r\n\r\nYOKO: John…\r\n\r\nPAUL: My money’s on him. [John presumably falls] See! [general sounds of sympathy and laughter] \r\n\r\nYOKO: [sweet] You’re not eighteen, you know. \r\n\r\nJOHN: No, no. [high-pitched voice] It’s alright. Don’t worry about a thing, Yoko.\r\n\r\nYOKO: He’s not that young anymore, you see. [laughs] \r\n\r\nJOHN: No, I’m not eighteen anymore. I couldn’t do it at bloody twelve, never mind… [Michael presumably helps out; to Michael] You’re so kind. \r\n\r\nMICHAEL: Yeah, I’m courteous. [inaudible] \r\n\r\nJOHN: [pause; formal voice] Now, we were going to discuss, this afternoon, what religion meant to a pop star. And the pop star we’ve chosen is Ringo McCartney. Tell me, McCartney, does religion mean much to you in this present day, with all the trends and the swinging miniskirts that are about? [Yoko laughs] \r\n\r\nPAUL: Fuck all! Fuck all. \r\n\r\nJOHN: Well, I can see that’s he’s been disillusioned by the church in general in his remark of “Fuck all.” \r\n\r\nPAUL: Yeah well I went to, uh, Brighton with the Maharishi. Fuck all it meant to me! \r\n\r\nJOHN: Was it an important step to you?\r\n\r\nPAUL: Nothing, nothing. He didn’t groove me. \r\n\r\nJOHN: He didn’t groove.\r\n\r\nPAUL: No. \r\n\r\nJOHN: He didn’t smoke pot, by any chance?\r\n\r\nPAUL: No. \r\n\r\nJOHN: What about the Reverend Nipples?\r\n\r\nPAUL: Not a chance. \r\n\r\nJOHN: Not a chance. [pause] Well, do you like “X”[-rated] films?\r\n\r\nPAUL: Yeah. Yeah. Lulu, Barry Ryan, and “X” films. But Maharishi – no. \r\n\r\nJOHN: That was a pretty concisive opinion of the youth of today. Now we’re going on to a rather different group, uh, generation gap, and that’s Tumble Starker! Who’s sitting here. Now, what do you think about mock-Tudor shithouses in Weybridge and places like that? [Yoko laughs]\r\n\r\nRINGO: [posh voice] Well, I don’t mind them being in Weybridge. It’s just when they try and put them in London, I think they get in the way of all the traffic.\r\n\r\nJOHN: Yes, you’re so right. As you said yesterday, “Neither your arse nor your elbow.”\r\n\r\nRINGO: [sage-like] I said that. \r\n\r\nJOHN: I couldn’t – I’d never forget it. Well that’s all for this evening. [hums broadcast theme tune] Hmm hmm hmm, hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm…\r\n\r\n### You are definitely inclined towards it\r\n\r\nJanuary 14th, 1969 (Twickenham Studios): With George still out of the band, the rest of The Beatles loll around unproductively in the studio. Ringo casually suggests for John and Paul to write together again, just to fill the time. John (being John) answers in the form of a less-than-conspicuous ditty.\r\n\r\nRINGO: Yeah, why don’t you get together—\r\n\r\nPAUL: [facetious] Yeah, are you interested at all? \r\n\r\nRINGO: —and write a song?\r\n\r\nPAUL: [laughs] Really, yeah. \r\n\r\nJOHN: Actually, I’d say I started one last night. It goes something like this. You are definitely inclined towards it… Although sometimes I doubt it… \r\n\r\nYOKO: What are you joking about? [laughs] \r\n\r\nJOHN: Just… doing my new number. \r\n\r\nMAL: Is that the middle eight?\r\n\r\nJOHN: That’s the middle – I need a sort of chorus, and an outline. A format, to the, uh— \r\n\r\nPAUL: Common-garde. [general laughter]\r\n\r\n### Who’s the fool on the hill, Paul?\r\n\r\nJanuary 14th, 1969 (Twickenham Film Studios, London): Hard pressed to work on any new material, the group (sans George, who is still out of the band) talk idly about producer Glyn Johns’ ancestry, the train sets an unrelated production company is preparing for a film inside the studio, and the plans for the next day’s sessions. John and Paul interview each other about their non-existent projects, skirt the issue of John’s health, and communicate in alternations of absurdity and obscurity. (In other words: John and Paul, in approximation of Beckett. Doug Sulpy describes the tone of John’s voice as having “an interesting quality […] as if, wanting to say something serious for a change, he’s forgotten quite how”.) \r\n\r\nJOHN: Who’s the fool on the hill, Paul?\r\n\r\nPAUL: John. \r\n\r\nJOHN: [long pause] I’m trying to sell the house. [long pause] When I was young, so much younger than today, I never needed anybody’s help, in any way. But now my life has changed in oh so many ways. A-whop-bop-a-luma… a-lim-bam-boom. [long pause] We should hold some sanctions against George. Very tightly. \r\n\r\nPAUL: Wheat. Coal.\r\n\r\nJOHN: Yes. Wheat and coal. Bread loaves. Meat biscuits. Cardboard cut-outs. \r\n\r\nPAUL: You see the Thirty-Minute Theatre? \r\n\r\nJOHN: I did, but in a blue fuzz. But it didn’t get through to me. Nice colour, though. [pause] I had a visit from a hippie family. Wondered why I had so many bedrooms. \r\n\r\nPAUL: [long pause] Were you able to tell them?\r\n\r\nJOHN: Oh, yeah. I told them I’ve got a lot of bedrooms because I’ve got too many. And I offered them accommodation in Ireland, which they took up. \r\n\r\nPAUL: [long pause] Let’s crack on. [sighs] \r\n\r\nMICHAEL: Who’s got a match, as opposed to a lighter? \r\n\r\nPAUL: I have. \r\n\r\nJOHN: I have. \r\n\r\nMICHAEL: As opposed to a lighter. \r\n\r\nRINGO: A wooden one?\r\n\r\nPAUL: Blue gold?\r\n\r\nMICHAEL: A wooden one do, a wooden one not do… thank you. \r\n\r\nPAUL: I wooden wanna… \r\n\r\nMICHAEL: Are you [inaudible] John?\r\n\r\nGLYN: [laughs] No, I am not related. \r\n\r\nRINGO: Stratford John?\r\n\r\nGLYN: Nope. \r\n\r\nPAUL: Farmer John?\r\n\r\nGLYN: Augustus John, apparently. \r\n\r\nMICHAEL: The John. \r\n\r\nGLYN: Rumour has it Augustus John is a grandfather twice removed or something. [laughs] \r\n\r\nMICHAEL: That’s the way with most of us offspring [inaudible]. \r\n\r\nPAUL: [referring to the film equipment] Is that the new trick, the playback speed is up there?\r\n\r\nRINGO: They’ve been there for several years. \r\n\r\nPAUL: Still feeding back. [laughs]\r\n\r\nMICHAEL: Should we knock off early today or not?\r\n\r\nPAUL: Probably, yeah. \r\n\r\nMICHAEL: Should we knock on early tomorrow?\r\n\r\nJOHN: Yes, I’ll do that. \r\n\r\nPAUL: Knock on early?\r\n\r\nJOHN: Yes, I just uh… was up late, you know. \r\n\r\nPAUL: Yeah?\r\n\r\nMICHAEL: At the moment you’re a guest for lunch. \r\n\r\nJOHN: I was sort of stoned and high and watching films and I wouldn’t have made it anyway. And uh… \r\n\r\nPAUL: Check up. \r\n\r\nJOHN: [subdued] Yeah, but it’s not good if – I’m gonna come at ten, I should come at ten, you know.  \r\n\r\nPAUL: Up with the dawn, down with the sun. \r\n\r\nJOHN: Mm. \r\n\r\nPAUL: Ringo ever, Eric never. \r\n\r\nYOKO: [referring to the previous night?] It was worthwhile, though, wasn’t it?\r\n\r\nJOHN: Oh, it was worthwhile. [Paul and Yoko laugh] \r\n\r\nPAUL: Does he make a lot of fun of you, Yoko?\r\n\r\nYOKO: Not enough. [laughs] \r\n\r\nPAUL: Not enough. [John laughs] \r\n\r\nMICHAEL: I think they’re painting the train. They’ll be doing that while – whilst the time we’re here. \r\n\r\nJOHN: We’d better get on before it leaves, then. \r\n\r\nPAUL: Please believe me. I’d hate to miss the train. Oh yeah. [pause] Like the shoes?\r\n\r\nYOKO: Is that the fashion?\r\n\r\nPAUL: This is the thing now, you know. \r\n\r\nYOKO: Mm. \r\n\r\nPAUL: The next thing. The socks are – the socks are with them, they come with them. \r\n\r\nJOHN: You did introduce oxford bogs, didn’t you? [Paul and Yoko laugh]\r\n\r\nPAUL: Yeah, yeah. I am an innovator in many ways. \r\n\r\nJOHN: Well, apart from your part-time work, what are you doing?\r\n\r\nPAUL: Well, I do a lot of dramatic work, in and out of the country. \r\n\r\nJOHN: Presently, I’m working on a Welsh TV series called Land for Wecken, in which I appear as a Danish singer of royal blood who turned to folk singing after a disaster in the First World War where the Nazis bombed his house. \r\n\r\nPAUL: Mm. \r\n\r\nJOHN: And he had to move into, uh, Norway I think it was. Why, I was born on the train between Ostograd and Fensborough. \r\n\r\nPAUL: Jamaica?\r\n\r\nJOHN: Sometimes. [Ringo laughs] But generally I have a hell of a mi-graine. So I usually take uh, frantic, which usually gets rid of it. It dissolves in half the time, you see. [pause] It gave me a great background for the job I’m doing now. \r\n\r\nMICHAEL: It’s funny – it’s funny, really. The guy said to me, do you mind if they store their trains quietly in the back? And they’ve come totally populated with painters and the rest of them.\r\n\r\nJOHN: Now, the one thing you find about – we’re not pushy. \r\n\r\nPAUL: No. \r\n\r\nJOHN: People want to put trains in the middle of our set— \r\n\r\nPAUL: —they get it. \r\n\r\nJOHN: [inaudible]\r\n\r\nPAUL: [pause] Yeah. Mind you, we’re not mugs. \r\n\r\nJOHN: Oh no. \r\n\r\nPAUL: Oh no. \r\n\r\nJOHN: [referring to Apple] We gave it all away. It was our plan. \r\n\r\n### All this camp on TV\r\n\r\nJanuary 14th, 1969 (Twickenham Film Studios, London): With John, Paul and the others present seemingly loathe to rehearse or work on new material, John improvises a scene based on an earlier discussion about filming a Beatles detective thriller story in the studio. When director Michael Lindsay-Hogg expresses concern about how they should handle George’s walk-out in their proposed documentary of the sessions, John, whom along with Yoko, Paul, and Ringo has been speaking in non-sequiturs and idle thoughts for the past hour, suggests their current inhabitance of boredom would make a far more compelling film. As Yoko returns from making a phone call, John hooks onto the topic of Robert Baden Powell’s dissuasion of masturbation amongst the Boy Scouts.\r\n\r\nJOHN: Is Cilla Black? [Paul laughs] Read next week’s TV Times… and you’ll never know. [phone rings coincidentally in the studio] Ah! [Paul laughs; John pretends to hold a phone conversation] Sir Joseph. It’s about this deal with FBI. I need another million and the written acclimation of Dick James. [pause] I know it’s hard, I know it’s hard! But you’re in position to do it, George.\r\n\r\nMICHAEL: We were talking, earlier—\r\n\r\nJOHN: About the space between us?\r\n\r\nMICHAEL: [laughs] About the gap between us. But about also like the documentary, which is grinding to a halt. How we’d do it.\r\n\r\nJOHN: Grinding to a halt? I think it’s taking off.\r\n\r\nPAUL: [laughs] Taking— Here we go.\r\n\r\nJOHN: “Loop the loop,” as Frankie once said, the one-legged wonder.\r\n\r\nMICHAEL: Ringo said that he thought we ought to just tell it like it is, which is what I thought, but Mal thought we oughtn’t tell it like it is.\r\n\r\nPAUL: I think we are.\r\n\r\nMICHAEL: I think we are.\r\n\r\nJOHN: Well uh…\r\n\r\nMICHAEL: So those are the two camps, you might say, which goes back to the remark you were making earlier about Noël Coward.\r\n\r\nJOHN: [facetious] Well I do object to all this camp on TV, including Baden Powell on his foreskin. It’s one of the most upsetting things I’ve ever seen. Discouraging boys from masturbating in case he wets the sheets. [laughter] It’s funny you should say that. [Yoko returns]\r\n\r\nYOKO: What are you talking about?\r\n\r\nJOHN: I’m talking about the Boy Scouts who aren’t allowed to masturbate.\r\n\r\nYOKO: Oh.\r\n\r\nJOHN: It’s very tempting when you’re wearing shorts. If they only wore long trousers, maybe they’d stand a chance, you know. But I can tell you, you don’t go blind, but very short-sighted. [uproarious laughter]\r\n\r\nYOKO: Are you talking from experience, or just…?\r\n\r\nJOHN: From experience. [laughter] I remember during an English lesson, as I came, I suddenly noticed I needed glasses. I thought, “God, they were right.” But I’m not gonna give it up for anything! [Yoko laughs] All the tax I’ve earned. I should coco. [silence] We should dub on a spiritual message of that. [Paul and Yoko laugh]\r\n\r\n### No business like no business\r\n\r\nJanuary 14th, 1969 (Twickenham Film Studios, London): As the day trudges forth without any productivity for the Beatles’ second day without George in the group, Paul asks John about Two Virgins (under the flippant guise of a journalist) to which John responds with stiff sincerity. As director Michael Lindsay-Hogg comes round to confer, Ringo admits that he isn’t feeling well and wonders about having some rest. Michael commiserates, but expresses concern about the impetus of the group and is worried that they will individually (and indifferently) wander off to their own devices if they don’t have a routine schedule to solder them together as a working band - which prompts John and Ringo to sing a sentimental folk bar. Not being of the disposition to have serious discussions about the direction of the (Get Back/Let It Be) sessions, John, Paul, and Ringo (dis)engage in frivolous wit and references to the Laugh-In.\r\n\r\nPAUL: So what’s the point behind Two Virgins? [Yoko laughs]\r\n\r\nJOHN: It’s a six-inch nail. [long pause] The main point behind it is to open people’s minds to what’s happening today. There are people all over the country humming into tape recorders, and we hope to bring them out into the open. And hum together. [pause] You understand?\r\n\r\nPAUL: Hmm.\r\n\r\nJOHN: Now sold one thousand three hundred due to the great promotion from Apple Dietetics.\r\n\r\nYOKO: [laughs] Which is a figure you don’t want to expose, necessarily.\r\n\r\nPAUL: Is it very neat to do this in public, Mr. Lennon?\r\n\r\nJOHN: I feel obliged, in the position that I am today as a pop idol and the power I have, to do something for the good, and uh, I feel obliged to speak out… [pause] And that’s as simple as I can put it, really. Take Downing Street. South Orderly Street. Wimpole Street. All owned by the Queen. ‘Nuff said. [silence; fidgeting]\r\n\r\nMAL: [in background] Is anybody – wanna rehearse, or do songs, or—?\r\n\r\nYOKO: [inaudible]\r\n\r\nRINGO: I feel ill, actually.\r\n\r\nMICHAEL: Do you? Was this a mistake [inaudible]?\r\n\r\nRINGO: I don’t. [laughter]\r\n\r\nJOHN: I think a few days in bed…\r\n\r\nRINGO: Yes, I think so too.\r\n\r\nJOHN: Or maybe three days on the couch, depending on what your job is.\r\n\r\nRINGO: I think two days in bed.\r\n\r\nMICHAEL: Do you really not feel well?\r\n\r\nRINGO: No, I just feel a bit… ill.\r\n\r\nPAUL: [to Michael] Well, do you?\r\n\r\nMICHAEL: I don’t feel well, but I can’t say, ‘cause I’m the captain of the ship.\r\n\r\nJOHN: Oh you can. [Yoko laughs]\r\n\r\nPAUL: Why?\r\n\r\nMICHAEL: No, I don’t want to let the crew down.\r\n\r\nJOHN: Nowadays, the captain gets off first.\r\n\r\nMICHAEL: No, I go down with the ship.\r\n\r\nYOKO: [inaudible]\r\n\r\nJOHN: No he does, really.\r\n\r\nMICHAEL: I feel tired, but I think it’s tiring – disappointing.\r\n\r\nJOHN: [bored] Hmm.\r\n\r\nMICHAEL: But I have a feeling if we decide not to meet one day, we may never meet again.\r\n\r\nPAUL: Well…\r\n\r\nJOHN: Along this dusty road…\r\n\r\nRINGO: We’ll always meet again…\r\n\r\nJOHN: On this dusty road.\r\n\r\nYOKO: As they say, there’s no business like no business.\r\n\r\nJOHN: Again.\r\n\r\nPAUL: Yeah.\r\n\r\nYOKO: Again.\r\n\r\nPAUL: And still the boom [mic] wasn’t over them.\r\n\r\nJOHN: Ooh, the Queen of Sheba wore falsies.\r\n\r\nRINGO: [mock-surprise] I didn’t know that!\r\n\r\nJOHN: Didn’t you know that? You weren’t there at the time. [pause] Cleopatra was a carpet manufacturer.\r\n\r\nRINGO: I didn’t know that!\r\n\r\nJOHN: ‘Cause you weren’t there at the time. [pause] Edgar Allen Poe was a shithouse.\r\n\r\nRINGO: I didn’t know that!\r\n\r\nYOKO: What was John Lennon?\r\n\r\nJOHN: A patriot. [Yoko laughs] I didn’t know that. [laughter]\r\n\r\nJOHN & PAUL: “Goodnight, Dick.” [laughter]\r\n\r\nJOHN: [sighs] That was Lennon and McCartney. Northern Sheds. Great Western Railway.\r\n\r\nPAUL: Songs for all functions.\r\n\r\nJOHN: Ross-Upon-Wye.\r\n\r\nPAUL: Nige-Whalley-Mange.\r\n\r\nJOHN: Ilford two, Western Middlodeons – terrible.\r\n\r\n### A serious program of work\r\n\r\nJanuary 14th, 1969 (Twickenham FIlm Studios, London): As Paul jokingly suggests for the (Let It Be documentary) camera crew to capture Ringo (who isn’t feeling well) if he sicks on the floor, John mentions superficially that he threw up during an interview filmed earlier in the day with Yoko for Canadian television - not from illness, but from recent irresponsible habits, possibly exercised the previous night. Paul, who is wearied by the lethargy of the proceedings, tries to engage John about the recording sessions and how they should work while George is gone, but John palters, and at turns they both fall back on oblique references and emotionally indeterminate allusions.\r\n\r\nAfter John trades bad jokes with Ringo, Paul implores them to remember why they’re here and that they can’t idle forever, and John (seemingly contrite, if nonetheless facile) agrees to start rehearsing. Despite the others’ reservations about his health, a subdued Ringo reassures that he’s staying to play too.\r\n\r\nRINGO: Kevin?\r\n\r\nPAUL: I think if we hang around a bit longer we can get Ringo being sick. [laughter]\r\n\r\nJOHN: You – see, you missed me this morning, I did it for CBS. Just leapt off in the middle of the interview.\r\n\r\nPAUL: Did you?\r\n\r\nKEVIN: [in background] As a matter of fact, yes.\r\n\r\nJOHN: No reason at all, except that I’ve been mistreating my body.\r\n\r\nYOKO: I thought it was a happening.\r\n\r\nJOHN: It was a happening.\r\n\r\nPAUL: There was a lot of nervous tension, you know.\r\n\r\nJOHN: Oh, yes.\r\n\r\nPAUL: I mean, there was a bloody funny atmosphere in that room, mother.\r\n\r\nJOHN: Aye.\r\n\r\nMICHAEL: We missed out on the other day.\r\n\r\nJOHN: Hmm?\r\n\r\nMICHAEL: We missed it the other day, but then they wouldn’t let us have it.\r\n\r\nJOHN: They missed it too.\r\n\r\nMICHAEL: Oh. Were they in colour or black and white?\r\n\r\nYOKO: Colour.\r\n\r\nJOHN: I never noticed that. Colour.\r\n\r\nPAUL: [trying] See, what we need is a serious program of work. An endeavour. Not an aimless rambling amongst the canyons of your mind. [inaudible] —life.\r\n\r\nJOHN: Take me on that trip upon that golden ship of shores… We’re all together, boy.\r\n\r\nPAUL: To wander aimlessly is very unswinging. Unhip.\r\n\r\nJOHN: And when I touch you, I feel happy inside. I can’t hide, I can’t hide. [pause] Ask me why, I’ll say I love you.\r\n\r\nPAUL: What we need is a schedule.\r\n\r\nJOHN: A garden schedule.\r\n\r\nPAUL: Point A to Z. Travel to A to Z, and having reached the point – take a holiday.\r\n\r\nJOHN: It’s holiday time.\r\n\r\nPAUL: Achieve something, everyday. [pause]\r\n\r\nYOKO: It’s a hell of a lot to ask for…\r\n\r\nJOHN: That’s sort of hard to live up to, Paul.\r\n\r\nPAUL: [very quiet] It’s very hard to live up to.\r\n\r\nMICHAEL: Ernest Hemingway had a very good remark about that, which I’ve unfortunately forgotten. About achieving something everyday. It’s the only thing of his writings I like.\r\n\r\nPAUL: It may in theory sound silly, but—\r\n\r\nJOHN: In practice…\r\n\r\nPAUL: —it’s even sillier. Well, if practice is all there is.\r\n\r\nJOHN: This is where it’s at.\r\n\r\nPAUL: This is where it’s at, unless that is where it’s at.\r\n\r\nJOHN: This is where it’s at, now.\r\n\r\nPAUL: Mm-hmm. [long pause] Teamwork. A good defense. And a line of forwards. A good strong pair of boots.\r\n\r\nYOKO: [inaudible]\r\n\r\nJOHN: You play ball with me, and I’ll play ball with you.\r\n\r\nPAUL: Don’t swing the lead, sonny.\r\n\r\nJOHN: Every cloud have a silver mouth boat.\r\n\r\nPAUL: Could be learning something instead of this, you know.\r\n\r\nJOHN: Bob Newridges is a tartan that covers Yorkshire.\r\n\r\nPAUL: Rutland is the smallest county.\r\n\r\nJOHN: Scarborough is a college scarf.\r\n\r\nPAUL: Amo amas a minge.\r\n\r\nJOHN: [laughs] Amanty meaty monkey monk… [Paul laughs]\r\n\r\nYOKO: [to Michael] Are we going to see the rushes, or—?\r\n\r\nPAUL: This is the – this is the typical end-product of an actor’s career.\r\n\r\nJOHN: Alexander the Great was a bighead. Or a fireplace. [long pause] Why do they call it Great Britain? How long is it going to go on? Fantastic France. Amazing America.\r\n\r\nPAUL: Huge Spain.\r\n\r\nJOHN: [laughs] Huge Spain. I’ll drink to that. [pause] When is a door not a door?\r\n\r\nRINGO: I don’t know.\r\n\r\nJOHN: When it’s ajar.\r\n\r\nPAUL: When it’s ajar.\r\n\r\nRINGO: Two flies on a door. Which one was sick?\r\n\r\nJOHN: I don’t know.\r\n\r\nRINGO: The one on the panel.\r\n\r\nJOHN: I don’t blame it. [pause] Why did the chickie cross the road?\r\n\r\nPAUL: You see what you’ve done to us, pal?\r\n\r\nRINGO: To get to the other side.\r\n\r\nJOHN: You’ve heard it before!\r\n\r\nRINGO: Yes.\r\n\r\nJOHN: Clichés…\r\n\r\nRINGO: What goes over water, under water, and never gets wet?\r\n\r\nJOHN: Hmm… a rubber mac.\r\n\r\nRINGO: No, an egg in a duck’s belly.\r\n\r\nPAUL: [cutting in] Now, alright, we can’t carry on like this indefinitely now, can we?\r\n\r\nRINGO: I beg you?\r\n\r\nPAUL: We can’t carry on like this indefinitely.\r\n\r\nJOHN: Doing this?\r\n\r\nRINGO: We seem to be.\r\n\r\nPAUL: We seem to, but we can’t. Because our hearts are—\r\n\r\nJOHN: Should we go play our group, then?\r\n\r\nPAUL: There’s the other point.\r\n\r\nJOHN: I think this is rather good.\r\n\r\nPAUL: It’s alright, I must say, but we can’t carry on like this indefinitely.\r\n\r\nJOHN: As some clips in between.\r\n\r\nPAUL: Yeah.\r\n\r\nJOHN: [pause] As I said, I’m just recovering from the day, you know…\r\n\r\nPAUL: Dyspepsia.\r\n\r\nYOKO: From the night, frankly.\r\n\r\nJOHN: [stage whisper] Oh, don’t say that, you’re be revealings!\r\n\r\nYOKO: [laughs] Oh… I didn’t think about that.\r\n\r\nJOHN: “From the night”, indeed. Next thing you’ll be telling them about our black sheets! [laughter] Enriched with Marylebone Station… [fidgeting; gets up] Right. [to Paul] Guitars? I thought that’s what they do.\r\n\r\nPAUL: That is what they do, but if you’re singing—\r\n\r\nJOHN: Oh, I’ll even sing you half a song I was writing.\r\n\r\nPAUL: [gets up; to Ringo] C’mon. Sounds. How’s – how’s about?\r\n\r\nRINGO: [subdued] Sound city… Yes, go on, I’ll come.\r\n\r\nPAUL: [concerned] How are you feeling?\r\n\r\nRINGO: No, I just feel a bit off. Very—\r\n\r\nPAUL: [joking; bleak] Last two years, actually.\r\n\r\nRINGO: [laughs] No, it’s not that. It’s just that some days— [inaudible; drowned out by voice marking slate] —you don’t know how you feel.\r\n\r\n(Note: Kevin Harrington is one of the production runners in the studio. The phrase “canyons of your mind” is in reference to the song by The Bonzo Dog Doo Dah Band. Doug Sulpy describes John and Paul’s exchange in part as “a duel of witticisms”.\r\n\r\nDuring this period of time John was using heroin, which is the most probable cause - directly or indirectly - for his vomiting.)\r\n\r\n## 1/21\r\n\r\n### ‘In The Middle Of An Island’ / ‘Gilly, Gilly, Ossenfeffer, Katzenellen Bogen by the Sea’\r\n\r\nJanuary 21st, 1969 (Apple Studios, London): A singing of the 1957 song ‘In The Middle Of An Island’ segues naturally into ‘Gilly, Gilly, Ossenfeffer, Katzenellen Bogen by the Sea’.\r\n\r\n### Too bad about sorrows, too bad about love\r\n\r\nJanuary 21st, 1969 (Apple Studios, London): Paul leads the band into a lively rendition of Ronnie Hawkins’ ‘Forty Days’ (itself a variant of Chuck Berry’s ‘Thirty Days’). John and Paul exchange some nascent wordplay on the Rolling Stone journalist Al Aronowitz and then break into an old Lennon-McCartney composition.\r\n\r\nJOHN: Another Lennon-McCartney original entitled ‘All I Want Is You’.\r\n\r\nPAUL: Al a one a two. Al Aronowitz. Al Aronowitz.\r\n\r\nJOHN: Al Aronowitz if you’ll Aronowitz. We’ll both Aronowitz together.\r\n\r\nPAUL: Too bad about sorrows / Too bad about love…\r\n\r\nJOHN & PAUL: There’ll be no tomorrow…\r\n\r\nJOHN: For all of your love…\r\n\r\nPAUL: You said you were sleeping / But I can’t forget / The trouble you’re leaving…\r\n\r\n### Shag! Everybody shag now!\r\n\r\nJanuary 21st, 1969 (Apple Studios, London): John and Paul sing brief racy takes of ‘You’re Gonna Lose That Girl’ and ‘Shout!’.\r\n\r\nJOHN: You’re gonna shag that girl… Shag! Everybody shag now! Everybody shag!\r\n\r\nPAUL: A little bit harder now, a little bit softer now…\r\n\r\n### ‘William Street Boogie’\r\n\r\nJanuary 21st, 1969 (Apple Studios, London): Paul gurgles ludicrously throughout a blues boogie with entirely improvised lyrics.\r\n\r\n## 1/22\r\n\r\n### For the sake of the boy you once knew\r\n\r\nJanuary 22nd, 1969 (Apple Studios, London): After John tells Yoko, Paul, and George about having received a letter from Millie Sutcliffe requesting his financial support, George reads aloud from the letter while John expresses his derision for Mrs. Sutcliffe’s justification of responsibility - his old friendship with Stuart - and points out that Stuart didn’t even have much regard for her.\r\n\r\nGEORGE: Well, what’s Mrs. Sutcliffe want?\r\n\r\nJOHN: Well, what they all want – money.\r\n\r\nGEORGE: [reading] “This is the last cry for help. My bank is now to the wall—” [laughs] My “back”.\r\n\r\nJOHN: “Back”, “bank”. [George laughs] I thought it was “bank” too.\r\n\r\nGEORGE: “—as it’s been many times before, but this is the last time. Since [Stuart’s father] Charlie’s sudden death in March ’66, o my consequent o’ long—” What?\r\n\r\nYOKO: [reading] “Illness”.\r\n\r\nGEORGE: “—illness, I have managed to exist—”\r\n\r\nJOHN: [withering] “Illness”? She’s an alcoholic.\r\n\r\nGEORGE: “—but now it is the end of the road.”\r\n\r\nJOHN: She’s an alcoholic, you know.\r\n\r\nGEORGE: “I beg of you, please come if only for the sake of the boy you once knew.” Fucking hell…\r\n\r\nJOHN: You know, what’s it got to do with me?\r\n\r\nGEORGE: What’s it got to do with Stu?\r\n\r\nJOHN: Yeah.\r\n\r\nGEORGE: I mean, she didn’t know him.\r\n\r\nJOHN: No, he hated her anyway. [laughter] I remember at college he used to tell me so. Except for she gave him twenty ciggies a day and five bob. [pause] So I mean, it’s registered [inaudible], I’ve just got to write her and say, “What?” Or something. I ought to… Should we carry on here, in the rock‘n’roll show?\r\n\r\nGEORGE: [laughs] Yeah.\r\n\r\n## 1/23\r\n\r\n### Oh come on, Ringo, you really know how to swing\r\n\r\nJanuary 23rd, 1969 (Apple Studios, London): While waiting for Paul and George to arrive in the studio, Michael Lindsay-Hogg asks a piano-toying Ringo if he will have his own song for the upcoming Beatles album. (Note: The song Ringo will work on over the next few days is, of course, ‘Octopus’s Garden’.) \r\n\r\nMICHAEL: Are you going to sing [your own song on this record]? \r\n\r\nRINGO: Um, more than likely I’ll get one later on. \r\n\r\nMICHAEL: Good. \r\n\r\nJOHN: Didn’t George write you one too?\r\n\r\nRINGO: George has written one for both of us. \r\n\r\nJOHN: You’re both in it?\r\n\r\nRINGO: Yeah. [John and Yoko laugh] Hey hey Georgie— [starts playing piano]\r\n\r\nJOHN: [laughs] Is it?\r\n\r\nRINGO: —come on, play that thing! \r\n\r\nJOHN: [laughs] Is it?\r\n\r\nRINGO: Yeah. [laughs] Oh come on, Ringo, you really know how to swing! One of those. \r\n\r\n### We could make it our last single\r\n\r\nJanuary 22nd, 1969 (Apple Studios, London): As the band works on ‘I’ve Got A Feeling’, an earlier conversation about Martin Luther King Jr. inspires Paul to improvise a line. John suggests they have a song about dreams as their last single. (Note: John could be thinking of Johnnie Taylor’s ‘I Had A Dream’ or Ray Charles’ ‘I Had A Dream’.)\r\n\r\nPAUL: All that I’ve been looking for was somebody who looks like you / I had a dream this afternoon!\r\n\r\nJOHN: I think somebody’s written it, actually.\r\n\r\nPAUL: Oh.\r\n\r\nJOHN: I have a feeling some spade wrote one called ‘I Had A Dream’.\r\n\r\nPAUL: Oh, yeah. [pause] I have a dream…\r\n\r\nJOHN: We could make it our last single.\r\n\r\n### Very phallic\r\n\r\nJanuary 23rd, 1969 (Apple Studios, London): Gallery owner Robert Fraser drops in on the sessions to find the lights in the studio blown out after a circuit overload. Yoko asks Robert (who hosted John and Yoko’s You Are Here art show) whether he’s already seen John and Yoko’s short films, and Robert enquires about the anvil in the room (which is being used for ‘Maxwell’s Silver Hammer’) which John makes fun of, comparing it to a conceptual art piece. Paul, who has been playing the piano, chats with Robert about the song.\r\n\r\nPAUL: We’re having a bit of trouble. [laughs]\r\n\r\nROBERT: Oh no.\r\n\r\nJOHN: Not one emergency light in all of them!\r\n\r\nROBERT: You should have a candle. Or I’ll give you a candle. Is that piece of anvil from [inaudible]?\r\n\r\nJOHN: Yes, it’s a Henry Moore we had brought in.\r\n\r\nROBERT: Yeah.\r\n\r\nJOHN: Henry Moore’s anvil.\r\n\r\nROBERT: Very phallic. [pause]\r\n\r\nPAUL: [laughs] It’s just a reminder. To remind you about ‘Maxwell’s Silver Hammer’ all the time. An anvil that will never be removed. Bang bang Maxwell’s silver hammer…\r\n\r\nROBERT: Was this, um, a blacksmith’s place, before? [Paul laughs] In the basement?\r\n\r\nPAUL: This is Mal’s instrument. For a song called ‘Maxwell’s Silver Hammer’.\r\n\r\nROBERT: Oh I see, yeah.\r\n\r\nPAUL: When Mal hits it. “Bang bang, Maxwell’s silver hammer.”\r\n\r\nROBERT: Why did you decide it had to be an anvil?\r\n\r\nPAUL: It was just that – you see, it was just that sound that came to me one day. A silver hammer on an anvil.\r\n\r\nROBERT: Yeah. Very refined. Really terrific.\r\n\r\n## 1/24\r\n\r\n### We’re a couple of queens\r\n\r\nJanuary 24th, 1969: As John and Paul discuss their vocal arrangement for ‘Two Of Us’, John wryly points out the queerness in having them share lead vocals on a love song. Paul, undeterred, suggests the male-female singing duo Paul and Paula step in for them as a replacement.\r\n\r\nPAUL: Okay, “two of us riding nowhere,” that’s as if – [that’s] said we’re like – two, but then “we’re on our way home—”\r\n\r\nJOHN: It’s like we’re like a couple of queens.\r\n\r\nPAUL: Yeah. Well, you know. Well, I mean, that’s—\r\n\r\nJOHN: We’re a couple of queens…\r\n\r\nPAUL: [American accent] That’s just too bad. Unless you want to get Paul and Paula in. [pause] Poetic license, John.\r\n\r\nJOHN: [American accent] You’re telling me, Paul.\r\n\r\n### It’s like you and me are lovers\r\n\r\nJanuary 24th, 1969: After John and Paul run through another take of ‘Two Of Us’, Paul comments on the narratives and discreet emotional correlation between their songs.\r\n\r\nPAUL: It’s like, uh, “We have to get back.” “We’re on our way home.”\r\n\r\nJOHN: Yeah.\r\n\r\nPAUL: There’s a story. There’s another one – ‘Don’t Let Me Down’. “Oh darling, I’ll never let you down.” Like we’re doing—\r\n\r\nJOHN: Yeah. It’s like you and me are lovers.\r\n\r\nPAUL: [reserved] Yeah. [pause]\r\n\r\nJOHN: We’ll just have to camp it up for those two.\r\n\r\nPAUL: Yeah. Well, I’ll be wearing my skirt for the show, anyway.\r\n\r\n### Balls to your partner, arses to the wall\r\n\r\nJanuary 24th, 1969 (Apple Studios, London): Paul briefly breaks into a curious ditty during a lull between takes. (Note: Mr. Bengelstein, I presume?) \r\n\r\nPAUL: Balls to your partner / Arses to the wall… \r\n\r\n### Boiled testicle\r\n\r\nJanuary 24th, 1969: John and Paul play through an old Lennon-McCartney song called ‘I Fancy Me Chances’, amuse themselves with their lunch orders, and ponder the etymological origins of “brer”. Paul then talks to himself about being a carpenter.\r\n\r\nJOHN: Crepe corbett.\r\n\r\nPAUL: Broccoli hors d'oeuvre.\r\n\r\nJOHN: Sparrow on toast.\r\n\r\nPAUL: … Boiled testicle.\r\n\r\n### You pretend to be in with the in crowd\r\n\r\nJanuary 24th, 1969 (Apple Studio): During a break in the Let It Be sessions, Paul makes up a song about his (less famous) dog, Eddie. To John’s amusement and eventual participation, it turns into an extended ode to Beatles pets. (Note: Mentioned are Ringo’s dog Tiger, John’s dog Bernard, John’s late dog Nigel, and John’s cat Mimi. John’s poem Good Dog Nigel recounts his unfortunate demise - at the hands of Aunt Mimi.)\r\n\r\nJOHN: [laughs] You have to sing it “There you go, Bernard”. ’Cause he was given away. \r\n\r\nJOHN & PAUL: [singing] There you go, Bernard, Bernard, Bernard… I’m so sad to see you go, Bernard, Bernard you dog. \r\n\r\n## 1/25\r\n\r\n### After this is all over, you’ll be off in a black bag somewhere\r\n\r\nJanuary 25th, 1969 (Apple Studios, London): After a protracted discussion about the prospective production value of (what will eventually be) the Let It Be documentary, George tries to allay Paul’s underlying (overriding) concerns about the still-unstructured production and tells him that the group’s best efforts have tended to be spontaneous anyway, and John points out that Paul’s retainment of his original intentions for this project, in spite of its changes over the past three weeks, is what is causing him anxiety. Paul responds in a possible intimation of his own investment in the band in comparison to John’s, and John, in possible acknowledgment of it, contends that he would dig playing onstage as The Beatles again, if not for the inertia they would inevitably labour under as a touring group.\r\n\r\nAs Paul bleakly compares their present monotony in the studio precisely to the monotony they felt while on tour performing the same songs over and over again night after night, George reasons (not unkindly) that it’s an emotional cycle that everyone goes through, no matter the state of affairs they’re in, and in this case, feels the familiarity of Apple Studios (attendant film crew non-withstanding) would be better for the group’s musical finesse than having to involve themselves with the hassle of touring again. Paul, however, remains uncertain of his own feelings and wonders aloud about why he feels them at all. Producer Glyn Johns, who has been listening in, sincerely vouches for the buoyant studio atmosphere and heartening improvement the band has made in the past couple of days, and Yoko, likewise, encourages Paul to ride on the upswing and not tie himself down with the variables.\r\n\r\nGEORGE: The things that’ve worked out best ever for us haven’t really been planned any more than this has. It’s just, you know, it’s like you just go into something and then it does it itself, you know. Whatever it’s gonna be, it becomes that, you know. \r\n\r\nJOHN: See, it’s turned out – that, for that, but it’s not what Paul wants. Like, you know, it was – it’s like if – say it’s his number, this whole show. Well it’s turned – it’s a compromise. So now it’s actually turned into our number more than his number. That’s all. \r\n\r\nPAUL: Yeah, and that’s— \r\n\r\nJOHN: And uh— \r\n\r\nPAUL: —and that’s alright, you know. It’s—  \r\n\r\nJOHN: It’s alright, but I mean that’s what’s bugging you, really. Because it’s a different number, you know. It’s turned into a rock number as opposed to a choir number or something, you know, like that. And uh… [quiet] it’s just that, really. [silence] \r\n\r\nPAUL:\r\n\r\nBut it’s just funny to sort of realise that after this is all over, you’ll be off in a black bag somewhere – on the Albert Hall, you know.\r\n\r\nJOHN: Yes. \r\n\r\nPAUL: And sort of doing shows and stuff, and you know, digging—\r\n\r\nJOHN: Yeah, but I— \r\n\r\nPAUL: —digging that thing of it. \r\n\r\nJOHN: But I don’t – I would dig to play on stage, you know. \r\n\r\nPAUL: Yeah. \r\n\r\nJOHN: I mean, if it was – if everything was alright and there was no messing, and we were just going to play onstage… you know.\r\n\r\nPAUL: Yeah. But it’s only that. It’s only that. I’d like to see Ringo and us – [inaudible] you know, and all that. But I mean—\r\n\r\nJOHN: That’s why I said yes to the TV show. I didn’t want the – the hell of doing it. \r\n\r\nPAUL: —and I’d like that. I’d like that, see, so that’s—\r\n\r\nJOHN: Well, I like playing – ‘cause that’s why I went on the Stones show [Rock and Roll Circus], you know?\r\n\r\nPAUL: Mm. \r\n\r\nJOHN: [faltering] And that’s why I’ll – I’ll do – things, but I mean if – if we all don’t want to do that… \r\n\r\nPAUL: [reserved] Yeah, I know, it is that. It’s like the majority decision to – yeah. \r\n\r\nJOHN: [wary] But I don’t want to sort of, uh, go on the road again. [silence; guitar playing] \r\n\r\nPAUL: Yeah. I just feel as though we are on the road again. I mean, we are, but we’re in the studio. Like, and we just keep to the same environment, totally. Always. We don’t ever attempt to break out of that. \r\n\r\nJOHN: Well, we did, though! We did.  \r\n\r\nPAUL: And that’s – you know. So I mean— \r\n\r\nGEORGE: Yeah. It’s just, you break out of one into another and then you want to break out of that. \r\n\r\nPAUL: Yeah, but I mean – you know. \r\n\r\nYOKO: Maybe next week— \r\n\r\nPAUL: [preoccupied] It is like the reason it’s nice to live on the country, you know. Just because it’s nice out there. It’s nice in a warm environment, you know. \r\n\r\nYOKO: [to Paul referring to the other Beatles?] Maybe next week they might change their minds, though. \r\n\r\nJOHN: [to Yoko] [inaudible]\r\n\r\nGEORGE: In my opinion this is the nicest place I’ve been for a long time, this studio. \r\n\r\nPAUL: Yeah, it is. \r\n\r\nGEORGE: No, really, you know. I mean, and also we’ve played – this is the most I’ve ever played, by playing everyday. And I can just, you know, feel myself getting – me fingers getting loose, a bit. Because we don’t get a chance for that. But if we go out on the road, then – or whatever – it falls, it gets back into that one. But really I just want to play, and you can play better without having to, you know, do all those things. \r\n\r\nPAUL: [preoccupied] Yeah. \r\n\r\nGEORGE: I mean, it’s not so bad now – but it is, really, it would be easier to play without all these mics and without all the cameras and things like that. But uh… \r\n\r\nPAUL: Yeah, it’s alright. [silence; George starts playing Bob Dylan’s ‘All I Really Want To Do’]\r\n\r\n…\r\n\r\nPAUL: I don’t know what it is, you know, that I’m moaning about, but it’s just sort of—\r\n\r\nGLYN: I must admit, I can’t really see it like – [laughs; optimistic] because it’s – it’s just seeing the last two days, everything’s gone so ridiculously well. \r\n\r\nPAUL: It is, it’s going great, really good. \r\n\r\nYOKO: It’s going great. \r\n\r\nGLYN: We still need—\r\n\r\nYOKO: [to Paul; encouraging] And maybe next week it might change, you don’t know.\r\n\r\nPAUL: Yeah, sure, I mean… \r\n\r\nYOKO: I mean, it might be great… and everyone might feel like going outside, you know.\r\n\r\nPAUL: Mm. \r\n\r\n### ‘I Lost My Little Girl’\r\n\r\nJanuary 25th, 1969 (Apple Studios, London): Uninterested in discussing the technical vagaries of the Get Back/Let It Be production with Paul and Michael-Lindsay Hogg any longer, John starts to riff on Paul’s very first composition, ‘I Lost My Little Girl’. Everyone else in the group eventually joins in to jam. (Note: John actually starts singing the song about three minutes prior to the start of this clip, when Paul is still in discussion with Michael Lindsay-Hogg. So, he’s been going on for a while.)\r\n\r\n### Eins zwei drei vier! You and I have memories\r\n\r\nJanuary 25th, 1969: John and Paul amuse themselves with ‘Two Of Us’, singing it in German accents, Scottish accents, Jamaican accents, and… whatever else besides.\r\n\r\n### I’ll have you banned from bloody Apple\r\n\r\nJanuary 25th, 1969 (Apple Studios, London): As the band starts to meander after several imperfect and increasingly unserious rehearsals of ‘Let It Be’ (including a stray comment from Paul that prompts John and George to break into Chuck Berry’s 'I’m Talking About You’), Paul tries to steer them back to a serious run-through. John protests in jest and, perhaps reminded of the Beatles’ improvised Christmas records, starts thanking the fans for all of the gifts they’ve sent. The next rehearsal of 'Let It Be’ is foiled again by Paul and Ringo, however, enabling John to get into a mock-tirade about not even reaching the part of the song where he comes in (to the amusement of the group). \r\n\r\nPAUL: Come on now, come on now, come on now. Come on now – back to the drudgery. \r\n\r\nJOHN: [mock-outrage] It’s you that’s making it like this, it’s you that’s bloody making it like—\r\n\r\nPAUL: The real meaning of Christmas. [starts playing ‘Let It Be’]\r\n\r\nJOHN: I’d especially like to thank you for all the birthday presents…  \r\n\r\n…\r\n\r\nPAUL: There will be an answer, let it be… [falters; laughs] Then, is it— \r\n\r\nJOHN: Ah! \r\n\r\nPAUL: Ah.\r\n\r\nJOHN: You shook me. [to Ringo] You stuck in another verse there, Richard. \r\n\r\nPAUL: Yeah. You send me.\r\n\r\nRINGO: What?\r\n\r\nJOHN: He’s got another verse in there, now. You come in with the flugle. \r\n\r\nRINGO: Alright, John!\r\n\r\nPAUL: [laughs] You only have to pick your nose and a camera and a boom is over there… \r\n\r\nJOHN: Okay, this is your last chance. \r\n\r\nPAUL: Now look boys, now come on. Enthuse a little.\r\n\r\nJOHN: [mock-outrage] I can’t, I don’t even get up to my bit, you keep finishing! [everyone laughs] Shut up, will ya, or I’ll have you banned from bloody Apple if you don’t shut up! [Paul laughs; John subdues himself] Okay, “Let it be…” is where I come in… [laughter]\r\n\r\n## 1/26\r\n\r\n### Did you dream about me last night?\r\n\r\nJanuary 26th, 1969: Paul arrives at the studio accompanied by Linda and Heather just as George and Ringo are working out the melody for ‘Octopus’s Garden’ on the piano. John, who has been playing around on drums, chimes in none too discreetly with a question he’s been eager to ask Paul.\r\n\r\nJOHN: Hey! Did you dream about me last night?\r\n\r\nPAUL: [long pause] I can’t remember.\r\n\r\nJOHN: Very strong dream. We both dreamt about it. It was amazing! Different dreams, you know, but I thought you must’ve been there. [inaudible] I was touching you. [inaudible]\r\n\r\nPAUL: Nothing to worry about, though?\r\n\r\nJOHN: Nothing to worry about, no.\r\n\r\n### Octopuses pick up all the seashells\r\n\r\nJanuary 26th, 1969 (Apple Studios, London): As the Beatles work on the arrangement for Octopus’s Garden’, Ringo tells Paul about the basis for the song, piquing George’s memory of what he was once told about octopuses. (Note: John’s on drums. This clip from the sessions is shortly followed by Heather sharing her personal octopus anecdote with John - which I can’t make out, unfortunately - and more animal banter.)\r\n\r\nGEORGE: Hey, it was somebody – he was telling me octopuses go and pick up all the seashells. You know about that?\r\n\r\nRINGO: Yes, that’s why I wrote it! ‘Cause the guides told me [about them] on the boat in Sardinia. [inaudible]\r\n\r\nGEORGE: Yeah. [to Paul] You know about that? They collect all nice-looking things and make a garden around where they are and just with all their groovy things to sleep behind.\r\n\r\nRINGO: Yeah.\r\n\r\nGEORGE: [laughs] It’s great.\r\n\r\n### You don’t eat any cats\r\n\r\nJanuary 26th, 1969 (Apple Studio): While Paul, George, and Ringo work on the arrangement for ‘Octopus’s Garden’, John teases Paul and Linda’s daughter Heather about her new pets.\r\n\r\nHEATHER: We’ve got some baby kittens only about that big—\r\n\r\nJOHN: Are you going to eat them?\r\n\r\nHEATHER: No!\r\n\r\nJOHN: Lots of people do, you know. I don’t, I mean.\r\n\r\nHEATHER: Kittens that have just been born yesterday, or a few days—\r\n\r\nPAUL: On toast? On toast?\r\n\r\nJOHN: You put pastry around them, and then you have cat pie.\r\n\r\nHEATHER: A few days they were just born, weren’t they?\r\n\r\nJOHN: Oh, you’d better wait a week or two before you eat them.\r\n\r\nHEATHER: No, I’m never going to eat them!\r\n\r\nJOHN: Aren’t you? Well, that’s very good.\r\n\r\nHEATHER: And then we took the grown-ups, and one of them’s beautiful, like this Daddy cat. It’s got a big black spot there—\r\n\r\nJOHN: Oh, you don’t eat them if they have black spots.\r\n\r\nHEATHER: The other one’s like a tiger.\r\n\r\nJOHN: You don’t eat them if they’re like tigers, either. [laughter]\r\n\r\nHEATHER: You don’t eat any cats! They don’t taste good. [general laughter] And anyway, I’m just a pussycat who was just born.\r\n\r\nJOHN: Are you?\r\n\r\nPAUL: Okay, pussycat.\r\n\r\nJOHN: There’s a good dog. Puss. \r\n\r\n…\r\n\r\nHEATHER: Stop keep – stop keep calling me “dog”, I’m a cat.\r\n\r\nJOHN: Okay, cat.\r\n\r\n### Cat food tins are too small\r\n\r\nJanuary 26th, 1969: While listening to a playback of ‘For You Blue’, Paul and Linda’s daughter Heather tells everyone about her pet kittens, and starts a discussion amongst John, Yoko, Paul, Linda, and George about their cat food preferences. \r\n\r\nHEATHER: Then the other kittens will have other kittens, then the other kittens - listen, Paul! - then you know, the other babies will have other babies and the other babies will have other babies, and the other babies will have other babies… and then some will have to be in our room, and in your room, and in everybody’s room! And then it’ll be too much. \r\n\r\n…\r\n\r\nJOHN: And they always make cat food tins too small.\r\n\r\n…\r\n\r\nJOHN: [laughs] I give them ping pong balls. [Heather roars] \r\n\r\n### Is that food? Cooking?\r\n\r\nJanuary 26th, 1969 (Apple Studios, London): After a couple dozen takes of ‘Let It Be’, John and George betray their restlessness and hunger, while Paul suggests a couple more takes before they take a break. John and Paul converse in mock-German.\r\n\r\nJOHN: Should we do it once more and have dinner? It must be our dinner cooking, nobody else lives here.\r\n\r\nGEORGE: Is that food? Cooking?\r\n\r\n## 1/27\r\n\r\n### How much does he love Yoko?\r\n\r\nJanuary 27th, 1969 (Apple Studios, London): Over breakfast, John shows Paul a book he’s had compiled of the various press articles covering John and Yoko’s You Are Here art show. Paul reads aloud from some of the articles to the amusement of John and Yoko.\r\n\r\nPAUL: “Beatle John Lennon hugged actress Yoko Ono last night and said, ‘My marriage is over. I am in love with Yoko. Of course my wife and I are not through legally—’” \r\n\r\nJOHN: That they put “actress” is great. \r\n\r\nYOKO: [laughs] No, they thought I performed in the Bottoms film. [laughter] They took it so seriously… \r\n\r\nJOHN: Said it seriously. \r\n\r\nPAUL: “How much does he love Yoko? ‘Much more than I love the Queen.’” [laughter; Paul hums] \r\n\r\nJOHN:\r\n\r\nThe layout of the book’s really good though, the way he’s done it. \r\n\r\nPAUL: This – is this the layout?\r\n\r\nJOHN: No, this is just the bit – that bit, you know. Because he’s gonna have that folding out of the book, sheets, like, because – to get them all together. But it’s just, you know. The packaging is great. \r\n\r\nPAUL: It’s good, yeah. Great. [inaudible; continues reading articles aloud]\r\n\r\n?: What else is there?\r\n\r\nJOHN: There’s hundreds of things, you know, this is just the press part of it. There’s all the letters I got, and the photos of the exhibition, and – yeah. \r\n\r\n?: Oh, just this topic. \r\n\r\nJOHN: Yeah. The whole You Are Here book, you know. Book of the film of the video. \r\n\r\n?: And the policeman. Is that included in the film? The statement—\r\n\r\nJOHN: No, no. This is just – just that one day. Reaction to one day. \r\n\r\nYOKO: It’s amazing, isn’t it? Just for that one day. \r\n\r\nPAUL: Yes. \r\n\r\nJOHN: But it’s just great you know, it’s sort of like what we’re doing now. We’re doing a show, and then you bring in a book of the show— \r\n\r\nPAUL: Yeah. \r\n\r\n?: Who’s doing it?\r\n\r\nJOHN: Uh, publishing it?\r\n\r\n?: Yeah. \r\n\r\nJOHN: Cape. That’s what I think—\r\n\r\nYOKO: That’s what – I think that’s where we’re going with, Cape. \r\n\r\nJOHN: Yeah, I’m gonna go to Cape. \r\n\r\nPAUL: Is there a next book that you’ll be expecting?\r\n\r\nJOHN: Yeah, but I owe it [inaudible] in the contract. \r\n\r\nPAUL: Oh, indeed. Great. \r\n\r\nJOHN: So they’ll have to pay for it, and it’s expensive. The other one’s cost nothing to do. \r\n\r\n?: Who does this for you?\r\n\r\nYOKO: Oh, the [inaudible] or something. \r\n\r\n?: Oh, you have a [clipping] service, do you? Yeah, great. \r\n\r\n### You can’t book me for that, Constable\r\n\r\nJanuary 27th, 1969 (Apple Studios, London): As producer Glyn Johns grouses about having been apprehended by the police on a petty driving charge (and causing him to be late to arrive in the studio), Paul commiserates and humorously shares his own peeved exchanges with policemen on the road. \r\n\r\nPAUL: Let me take you down, ‘cause I’m going to…\r\n\r\nGLYN: Can you believe that bleeding copper! [stuffy voice] “Oh, alright, I’ll have to report this, you know, anything you say will be taken down,” and it went through all that! \r\n\r\nJOHN: Have you got a fag?\r\n\r\nGLYN: Yeah. \r\n\r\nPAUL: I had a terrible scene the other day on the motorway with a copper. ‘Cause they stopped me, and I – I don’t like it, getting stopped by police. I always get – I get obnoxious with them, you know. [Yoko laughs] ‘Cause I’ll just sort of check around to see if I’m in the right, and once I know I am, and they’ve stopped me, I get very… But they just stopped me because I was hogging the outside lane, and you’re not supposed to do that. So he said, “You did, you know.” You’re going seventy. You’ve got to stay out there, but you’re not supposed to get back in. So he stopped me, and then it really got sort of nasty after a bit. ‘Cause Linda just had her hand round the back of my head, and then he said, “You can’t possibly be in – in control!” \r\n\r\nYOKO: [laughs] Oh, no.  \r\n\r\nPAUL: “You see how that young lady was fondling the back of your neck…” [uproarious laughter] And I said, “Oh, what’s up with you, then? Don’t you get it?” [laughter] You know, and it got really like that. “Oh! You can’t book me for that, Constable!” You know, it got really sort of… “Oh, can’t I!” [laughter] And of course, my tax. [laughs] They got me. My tax wasn’t up to date and all.\r\n\r\nJOHN:\r\n\r\nDon’t they just do it at the office for us?\r\n\r\nPAUL: No. \r\n\r\nJOHN: Oh. I probably haven’t had one done since I started, then. [laughter] \r\n\r\nPAUL: They keep doing that. I was going through Mersey Tunnel, and they keep stopping me in the Mersey Tunnel ‘cause they see you and they just want an autograph. So I sort of thought, “Right, this time, they’re not going to stop me.” And a fella comes up, and I just – all the way through the tunnel, I did thirty. Just saw him in the mirror all the time. I thought, “You… you’re going to stop me at the end and ask me for an autograph.”\r\n\r\nSo he just sort of drives in front of me waves me down, so I’m just — ah! [laughter] – crash in with him and say, “No, no, I have no time, no time!” And he just… [grumbling] So he stopped me and said, “… Your tax.” [laughter] Yeah. I can’t stand that, I really go sort of funny with police. You know, police [inaudible] when nothing’s been done, fighting against them before they’ve got me for anything. I don’t like it.\r\n\r\n### Happy and a rocker\r\n\r\nJanuary 27th, 1969 (Apple Studios, London): A chipper George is the last to arrive at the studio while the rest of the group is having breakfast. He tells the group that he was up the previous night writing a song (prompting John to reveal that he’s been having trouble sleeping himself), in mind of John’s old advice to finish a song within the time you start writing it. This, in full awareness of John’s own less-than-disciplined creative process, incites knowing laughter from the group. (Note: The song George wrote was ‘Old Brown Shoe’.)\r\n\r\nJOHN: I have a complaint as a director of Apple – no bog paper.\r\n\r\nPAUL: Oh yeah? [Yoko laughs]\r\n\r\nJOHN: Terrible disgrace. \r\n\r\nPAUL: They’ve got [it in] pink upstairs.  \r\n\r\nJOHN: Have they?\r\n\r\nPAUL: Yeah. [George arrives]\r\n\r\nJOHN: Hi. \r\n\r\nPAUL: Hi, George. \r\n\r\nGEORGE: Hello, how are you? Happy new year!\r\n\r\nJOHN: [joking] George’s just come from a party too. \r\n\r\nGEORGE: [laughs] Yeah, I thought… \r\n\r\nJOHN: Two hours extra sleep [inaudible].\r\n\r\nGEORGE: Oh, I didn’t, I went to bed very late. I wrote a new song, actually.\r\n\r\nJOHN: I couldn’t sleep. \r\n\r\nGEORGE: I wrote a great song actually. \r\n\r\nJOHN: About what? [taps out a familiar rhythm in question] \r\n\r\nGEORGE: No, though – oh that, no, I just played with that bit. Just – a different one, altogether. Very exciting. [laughs] \r\n\r\nJOHN: It’s such a high when you get home. \r\n\r\nYOKO: Mm.\r\n\r\nGEORGE: Happy. Happy, and a rocker…\r\n\r\nPAUL: Yeah?\r\n\r\nGEORGE: Happy and a rocker! [laughs] Too much. \r\n\r\n…\r\n\r\nJOHN: Well, it’s just so high when you get in at night. \r\n\r\nGEORGE: Yeah, it’s great, isn’t it? [laughs]\r\n\r\nJOHN: I just – you know, that bit like on acid, where you see a little hand miles away. \r\n\r\nPAUL: Mm.\r\n\r\nJOHN: I was just sitting there listening to the last bit. [stage whisper] “Help! What if I have? What if I haven’t, today?” [laughter] You know, “[inaudible] Do they have anything?”\r\n\r\nYOKO: You should just try in general. \r\n\r\nJOHN: I just can’t sleep! I just— [starts making garbled noises and sounds] You know. “I’m a feeling a little thing here…” [makes the sound of a trumpet blaring; laughs] \r\n\r\nGEORGE: Uh, I keep thinking, “Oh, I’ll just go to bed now,” and then I keep hearing your voice from about ten years ago saying, “Finish ‘em straightaway. As soon as you start ‘em, you’ve got finish it too.” [pause] You once told me it was best to finish a song, so I was just there to… [uproarious laughter]  \r\n\r\nJOHN: [laughs] But I never do it, you know. I can’t do it. But I know it’s the best. \r\n\r\nPAUL: Yeah. \r\n\r\n### ‘Oh! Darling’\r\n\r\nJanuary 27th, 1969 (Apple Studios, London): The Beatles play an extended run-through of ‘Oh! Darling’, with John offering harmony and call-and-response to Paul’s lead vocal. (Note: A considerably shorter and edited version of this take was included on Anthology 3.)\r\n\r\nPAUL: When you told me…\r\n\r\nJOHN: When you told me…\r\n\r\nPAUL: You didn’t need me…\r\n\r\nJOHN: You’d never leave me…\r\n\r\nPAUL: Anymore / You know I nearly broke down and died / Oh when you told me / You didn’t need me anymore / You know I nearly broke down and died…\r\n\r\n### ‘Bring It On Home To Me’ / ‘Oh! Darling’\r\n\r\nJanuary 27th, 1969 (Apple Studios, London): John and Paul sing an ephemeral mashup of Sam Cooke’s ‘Bring It On Home To Me’ and ‘Oh! Darling’ before segueing into ‘Oh! Darling’ proper. \r\n\r\n### ‘Get Back’\r\n\r\nJanuary 27th, 1969: Paul sings an amusing mock-German version of ‘Get Back’ (along with liberal doses of mock-French).\r\n\r\n### I cried for water, water, all I want is drink\r\n\r\nJanuary 27th, 1969: John and Paul play a bluesy mash-up during the Let It Be sessions, with John taking lead vocal for ‘Get Back’, and Paul singing an unidentified song (possibly made up on the spot) full of holy, apocalyptic fervor.\r\n\r\nPAUL: Order! Order! We’ve got to call order, John, I mean, you know, we’re wasting valuable time here, son.\r\n\r\nJOHN: Don’t let me down, babe!\r\n\r\n## 1/28\r\n\r\n### Attracts me like a pomegranate\r\n\r\nJanuary 28th, 1969: The Beatles work on how to play ‘Something’, while George figures out the lyrics for the song. \r\n\r\nGEORGE: Attracts me like a pomegranate… [laughs] We could have that, “attracts me like a pomegranate.”\r\n\r\n…\r\n\r\nJOHN: What were you saying?\r\n\r\nGEORGE: I was saying, uh, “Did you know who missed the show?” And to a chorus of, “I don’t know, I don’t know.”\r\n\r\n### Even badness must pass\r\n\r\nJanuary 28th, 1969: After John and Paul play a lethargic and depressed run-through of ‘All Things Must Pass’, George tries to convince them that the song can be optimistic, too.\r\n\r\nGEORGE: But it’s happy too, because it’s like – it’s like, if all things pass… it is sad [if] it means it’s always gonna leave something there. Doesn’t it? It means even badness must pass. You know. It’s like… [long pause]\r\n\r\nPAUL: Nothing’s permanent.\r\n\r\nGEORGE: ‘Cause it said, uh, the last one says, “Darkness doesn’t last all night time, and in the morning, it will fade away.” [pause] “Sunlight—” What is it? “Daylight – is—”\r\n\r\nPAUL: “The sunrise doesn’t last all morning.”\r\n\r\nGEORGE: “Daylight is good at arriving at the right time.” ‘Cause it always does. It gets so dark, and suddenly – it just comes at the right time, and, you know. Like this was—\r\n\r\nPAUL: It’s another shade of darkness, isn’t it? Or light.\r\n\r\n### I wish that for just one time you could stand inside my shoes\r\n\r\nJanuary 28th, 1969: In a not-uncommon instance of subliminal messaging (ergo musical commentary) during the Let It Be sessions, George sings a strain from Bob Dylan’s ‘Positively 4th Street’. Paul, unwittingly or not, joins in.\r\n\r\nGEORGE: And I know you’re dissatisfied with your position and your place; don’t you understand it’s not my problem? I wish that for just one time, you could stand inside my shoes, and just for that one moment, I could be you… I wish that for just one time, you could stand inside my shoes… You’d know what a drag it is to see you…\r\n\r\n## 1/29\r\n\r\n### We could be into other things\r\n\r\nJanuary 29th, 1969 (Apple Studios, London): A scattered morning discussion with Michael Lindsay-Hogg, Glyn Johns, and George Martin on the advent of having the group perform on the Apple Studios rooftop leads Paul into a circular conversation with John about the multiple media ventures they’re trying to pursue with this one recording session, and the persisting concern that the Beatles’ apparent lack of restriction (and lack of tolerance for having others impose restrictions upon them) is actually counterproductive to their efforts to complete the recording of the album. At a loss for articulating in concrete terms what may be obstructing the group from performing as well as they could, Paul wonders if they can only be cured of their repression and/or indecision if they are thrust unexpectedly into a foreign situation and forced by circumstance to adapt and improve unquestioningly, as they experienced in the early days of the band.\r\n\r\n(Note: An edited segment of this discussion was later included in the official Let It Be documentary, as is depicted in this gif set here. Overall, the reality of John and Paul’s exchange is less one-sided than it may seem in the film; this excerpt in itself is but a portion of it, and it shortly after expands to include George as well when he arrives at the studio.)\r\n\r\nJOHN: I can’t wait to work, here, you know.\r\n\r\nPAUL: Yeah.\r\n\r\nJOHN: Either… Anyway, you know. I just can’t wait to just—\r\n\r\nPAUL: Do it.\r\n\r\nJOHN: —have it, you know.\r\n\r\nPAUL: Yeah, but so… Hmm. But I’m just talking about this thing, like this thing we’ve entered upon now, we still haven’t got any aim for it, except another album, again. Our only aim, ever, is an album. Which is like a very non-visual thing, it’s very sort of… But it’s great, isn’t it, and we do albums, then. But—\r\n\r\nJOHN: But albums is what we’re doing, at the moment.\r\n\r\nPAUL: [uneasy] Yeah, but I don’t know. Like—\r\n\r\nJOHN: I mean, that’s what we [inaudible] talk about.\r\n\r\nPAUL: —like I was saying the other day, is that you – is that you – you— [hesitating] We’re into albums as the four of us, but I really think we could be into other things. But every time I talk about it, I really sound like I’m the showbiz correspondent, trying to hustle us to do a Judy Garland comeback, you know. But really, all I mean is – well, look, let’s get – let’s change, or let’s go into a studio, like a vision studio, after we’ve learnt all of these, that’s just as good as this for sound, that’s got the same sort of thinking…\r\n\r\nJOHN: I think it’s daft to move from this one, you know, I mean—\r\n\r\nPAUL: But it’s like we got much better takes after we moved from Twickenham to here.\r\n\r\nJOHN: Oh, yeah, but I mean here, in our life it’s like home, you know.\r\n\r\nPAUL: Yeah, sure, but our takes are getting not as good. So I’m just trying to think of a remedy.\r\n\r\nJOHN:Yes, but it’s up to Glyn to take it.\r\n\r\nPAUL: Which he has been doing all yesterday, now, and ‘Get Back’, like you said, you know, we’re not in it.\r\n\r\nJOHN: Yeah, but that depends on the day.\r\n\r\nPAUL: But the thing that puts us in it are the things – the only ever thing that has put us in it is a novelty. We’re, you know—\r\n\r\nJOHN: Yes, yes.\r\n\r\nPAUL: We’re ve– we work on novelty. If there’s a new approach, if he says, “Take”, we take for the first time.\r\n\r\nJOHN: Mm.\r\n\r\nPAUL: Oh, you know, I mean, we’re gonna be great in the rough dubs, these, because we don’t care, you know, and it’s great. And now it’s gonna be very hard to better those – that dub we’ve got. There’s just so much in it, even ‘Teddy Boy’, not having words. It’s just, there’s so much in all of that.\r\n\r\nJOHN: Yeah. Yeah, I have to agree—\r\n\r\nPAUL: And it’s like, it’s gonna be hard to better it.\r\n\r\nJOHN: —but I don’t think another move is gonna be the answer. It’s just like every—[inaudible]\r\n\r\nPAUL: You see, I said to Michael that he should really just—just black this, just make this black one day, so that when we come in in the morning, it’s – “What is it?” I mean, you know. You’ve got to be sneaky with the Beatles, or else we’ll just go on forever in a circle. We really won’t get out of it. ‘Cause whenever we talk about it, we have certain rules – like George was saying. “What do you want to do?” And he says, “No films.” But it’s wrong, that. It’s very wrong, though, because you don’t know. He says – what he means is, “No Help! or Hard Day’s,” and I agree, you know. But like, films – ‘cause this is a film – and he now doesn’t mind this.\r\n\r\nJOHN: Yeah.\r\n\r\nPAUL: But it’s like – it’s that kind of thing, like no TV shows, no audience. But, I mean – see, it’s like when we came back from Hamburg and did Leicester Du Montfort Hall, or wherever it was, Coventry – we played the ballroom, and we had the worst first night then, and we were all nervous, and it was terrible. Then we played another the next night, and we got a little bit better; the next night, hmm; and then the next! [vocalising] It was just too much, and we got into the playing because we got over the hang-up of the audience, and it was just like there was no one there, but it was a ner– a new sort of thing, and there was some fella in the front watching how you were playing… you know? And you just – we were just right into it. And those would have been – if we could have recorded those things, they will have been the greatest, because it is. It’s like Mal was saying, he said, “It’s the bounce thing,” you know. And we’re good at that, you know, once we get over the nervousness. But it’s like, it’s the hurdle of that nervousness is there, now. So that… you know. [hesitating] We’re – we can’t get over it now, unless – well, unless we really sort of, like, go to the Albert Hall and get in a black bag, you know.\r\n\r\nJOHN: Mm.\r\n\r\nPAUL: There’s no other way. We can’t think ourselves out of it. And we can’t sort of say, well, it will be alright. See, and then the only other alternative to that is to say, well, we don’t – we will never do it to an audience again. But if we intend to – to keep any sort of contact on that scene… [pause] Yeah. I do understand George’s just saying, “There’s no point,” you know, because it is like we’re Stravinsky, and it’s in the music. And he doesn’t sort of get up and play his ‘Joanna’ for them anymore. He just writes it, and just sort of maybe occasionally conducts it.\r\n\r\nJOHN: But as long as there’s a good reason – like George wants to do a heavy show, like Dylan and Presley, all that.\r\n\r\nPAUL: Mm.\r\n\r\nJOHN: And that’ll be a large – I don’t know, like, I mean, that – that’s all this.\r\n\r\nPAUL: Mm, yeah, I know, yeah. that’s always – that’s always just—\r\n\r\nJOHN: Okay, yeah.\r\n\r\nPAUL: That’s us again, you know.\r\n\r\nJOHN: Yes, I know.\r\n\r\nPAUL: It’s us going silly again.\r\n\r\nJOHN: It is, and I think – I think we might do it.\r\n\r\nPAUL: Yeah, sure, but I mean the thing is they could do that one after you’ve done your own one, you know.\r\n\r\nJOHN: Yes, yeah. But I think that—\r\n\r\nPAUL: It’s like, it’s like this thing, man. There is a show to be had out of what we’ve got here, which is just so incredible. It’s unbelievable. And you don’t have to go on the roof, you don’t have to go anywhere. You really only have to sing ‘em. And combined with the documentary material leading up to it, it’s just like an unbelievable thing. Because you’ll have the two elements and you’ve got it there, and there’s no – we don’t need any need to move from here. But somehow we need to get us for the – see, it’s like we’ve got all the lead-up, and the only thing we haven’t got for every song is the – the song, yet.\r\n\r\n### I enjoy it too, sometimes\r\n\r\nJanuary 29th, 1969: John and Paul work carefully on their vocal harmony for the refrain of ‘Dig A Pony’. John, whose voice is tired and strained, is self-deprecating about his own efforts. Paul, perhaps attuned to it, is quick to profess his admiration for the song.\r\n\r\nJOHN & PAUL: All I want is you…\r\n\r\nJOHN: But see, now we get into adding a little bit more paint, you know.\r\n\r\nPAUL: It’s alright, yeah. No, that’s good, that one.\r\n\r\nJOHN: Okay, tick it.\r\n\r\nPAUL: [sincere] I love that one.\r\n\r\nJOHN: [reticent] Thank you.\r\n\r\nPAUL: [insistent] I really really do.\r\n\r\nJOHN: Thank you. [quiet] I enjoy it too. Sometimes. [pause] So that’s done.\r\n\r\nPAUL: Um—\r\n\r\nJOHN: Next, please\r\n\r\n### I’m just gonna do me for a bit\r\n\r\nJanuary 29th, 1969 (Apple Studios, London): With some reservation (and/or hesitation), George expresses his desire to record and release an album of solo material after the sessions for Get Back/Let It Be are concluded, in mind of all the songs he’s written and accumulated over the years. John and Yoko support the idea, but George (perhaps sensing that John’s perception of “going solo” and what it symbolises is more absolute than his own) elaborates that he thinks it’d be a good thing not just for each member of the band, but for the Beatles as a band proper - they would be able to both free themselves creatively in their own personal outlets as well as play and record as a group without feeling stifled, innately in tune with one another.\r\n\r\n(In other words, the band doesn’t  have to sever all ties to go their own way. Ultimately, it’s difficult to determine if George is merely expressing, in a carefully unassuming way, his own intentions for individuation in light of John’s recent solo output with Yoko and growing estrangement from the Beatles family, or if he is making a discrete appeal to John of making up instead of breaking up, and is still, despite all of the Beatles’ overlapping troubles over the past two years, not least the past two weeks, genuinely attuned to the idea of the band staying together. Your mileage may vary.) \r\n\r\nGEORGE: John.\r\n\r\nJOHN: Yeah?\r\n\r\nGEORGE: I tell you what I’d like to do. After this—\r\n\r\nPAUL: After this TV—?\r\n\r\nGEORGE: —after this show. Um, you know, I’ve got so many songs that I’ve got, like, my quota of tunes for the next ten – you know, years, or albums.\r\n\r\nJOHN: Yeah.\r\n\r\nGEORGE: And I’d just like to maybe do an album, of songs.\r\n\r\nJOHN: Of – on your own?\r\n\r\nGEORGE: Yeah.\r\n\r\nJOHN: Yeah.\r\n\r\nGEORGE: But I mean, I’d like it so that if… uh… [long pause] ‘Cause it would be nice, it would be nice to mainly get them all out of the way—\r\n\r\nJOHN: Yeah. It’d be nice anyway.\r\n\r\nGEORGE: And secondly, just to hear what I – what all mine are like all together.\r\n\r\nJOHN: Yeah, as long – you see, it’s good. If we put [out] an LP and it’s all safe that will be ‘cause it’s together, but George is doing an album and—\r\n\r\nGEORGE: Oh yeah, but I mean it’d be nice to, uh—\r\n\r\nJOHN: It’d be the same as me doing an album.\r\n\r\nGEORGE: —if any of us can do the separate things, like, as well.\r\n\r\nJOHN:\r\n\r\nWell, I mean—\r\n\r\nGEORGE: That way, it also preserves this, the Beatle bit of it, more. ‘Cause then—\r\n\r\nJOHN: This – there’s an outlet for every note you want.\r\n\r\nGEORGE: You know, ‘cause all these songs of mine, I can give them to people who could do them good, but I suddenly realised – fuck all that. I’m just gonna do me for a bit. [laughs] You know?\r\n\r\nYOKO: That’s great. That’s a good idea.\r\n\r\nJOHN: Yeah.\r\n\r\nGEORGE: And uh, you know. [pause] With all these tunes I could do ‘em like – I could them in a week, at the most. I could have it all, just record ‘em all, remixed and everything, ‘cause they’re all very simple, you know. I mean, I don’t think they need much. I mean with a Leslie it’s too much, just one guitar. [starts playing ‘Let It Down’] Looking like I don’t care / but I do, I do… / Hiding it all behind anything I see / Should someone be looking at me… [laughs]\r\n\r\nJOHN: “She won’t be looking at me”?\r\n\r\nGEORGE: “Should someone be looking at me.”\r\n\r\nJOHN: Oh.\r\n\r\nGEORGE: While I occupy my mind / I can feel you here / Love to us is so well-timed / But I do, I do… / Wasting away these moments so heavenly / Should someone be looking at me…\r\n\r\n### ‘Three Cool Cats’\r\n\r\nJanuary 29th, 1969 (Apple Studios, London): The Beatles perform a boozy rendition of The Coasters’ ‘Three Cool Cats’.\r\n\r\n### ‘Two Of Us’\r\n\r\nJanuary 29th, 1969: John and Paul amuse themselves with ‘Two Of Us’, singing it with grit teeth.\r\n\r\n## 1/31\r\n\r\n### ‘Oh! Darling’\r\n\r\nJanuary 31st, 1969 (Apple Studios, London): John sings harmony with Paul in a lackadaisical take of ‘Oh!

Man.</p>\n<p>RINGO: [approving] Mm. [Paul laughs]</p>\n<p>PAUL: Well, you know, I’m—</p>\n<p>RINGO: Captain. [laughter]</p>\n<p>PAUL: Yeah.

I mean, so, she’s on a train—</p>\n<p>JOHN: Yeah.</p>\n<p>PAUL: And he sort of—</p>\n<p>JOHN: And he goes to the station, and misses it.</p>\n<p>PAUL: [laughs] But he goes back and finds that it was the wrong number. So—</p>\n<p>GEORGE: “Wrong location.”</p>\n<p>JOHN: [officious voice] To rhyme with station, you know.</p>\n<p>PAUL: [laughs] That’s great, that. “The rail man said, ‘You’ve got the wrong location.’” “Well…” Great.

Whether John is intentionally implying the breakup of the Beatles as an eventuality or merely using an innocent turn of phrase is unclear, but it prompts both Paul and George to relays their optimism about the band’s future prospects as long as they remain focused.</p>\n<p>George stresses the importance of rehearsing together until they have every number down by heart so that the band can go onstage again without insecurities and utterly assured of themselves and one another. He admits that the pain and tedium of the process has in the past frustrated his resolve in his own compositions and discouraged his level of involvement in the band (i.e. the others’ songs), but acknowledges that it is a necessary course to take and that they would not get anywhere without putting in raw hours of conscientious effort.</p>\n<p>In this frame of mind, George contends that the Beatles could realign themselves once again as a band more than the sum of their parts if everyone approached every song as if it were their own with the same amount of care and creativity, and in a moment of (perhaps uncharacteristic) sentiment expresses that when the four of them have it together, there’s no one else he’d rather play with.</p>\n<p>(Note: Transcript under the cut, because I evidently have no concept of critical economy. In the audio clip, George drifts in and out of singing Janis Joplin’s ‘Piece Of My Heart’; John is the one on the organ halfway through.)</p>\n<p>GEORGE: That band – uh, that band Bonnie &#x26; Delaney, for Apple, are more together than we’ve ever been. You know, as a band.</p>\n<p>JOHN: Yeah.</p>\n<p>GEORGE: [inaudible] You know, everyone’s who has ever been to see them playing, and sounding, their lives change. It’s really exciting when you hear a real groove on—</p>\n<p>JOHN: You see, I think when we’ve done a month of this and that, and we do an album, that somehow we should either use what we’ve – the togetherness, to do the album. You know.</p>\n<p>GEORGE: Yeah, to do a new one.</p>\n<p>PAUL: Yeah?</p>\n<p>JOHN: Yeah. But you know what I mean. We – we’re – we don’t fit. We’ve sort of run out of touch with it. If we get into the swinging of playing, let’s do an album after this album. You know, about a month later. That is, if we all— [inaudible]</p>\n<p>PAUL: But I mean, you know—</p>\n<p>JOHN: I mean, if we spend two – a month on this—</p>\n<p>PAUL: We are.</p>\n<p>JOHN: —just get to a good peak playing, and then we split.</p>\n<p>PAUL: No, well, we should – we should sort of organise our career, man.</p>\n<p>GEORGE: Yeah.</p>\n<p>PAUL: Get our career together. And this, you know, this is like the idea of this. It’s to get us so we quite enjoy this. Of doing it again. And then what would we like to do next? Well, I would like— [inaudible] —to do a live show, lads?</p>\n<p>GEORGE: Yeah. I think – I think when we learn to, like [inaudible] then we’d dig it. And we know ‘em all, what – you know, if somebody could say “that one” [and we could play them] when we were asked, that’d be great.\r\nPAUL: Well, we can do it, but— [inaudible]</p>\n<p>GEORGE: It’s just that choice. It’s like hard work, really, to do it. And uh, it’s – you know, it’s a drag to try and, you know – ‘cause I want to remember all the words—\r\nPAUL: Right.</p>\n<p>GEORGE: —and really, really get ‘em the way I want it to get ‘em, and to get the guitar, [and not keep being] made to perform when I don’t want to play the guitar. And then you’ve got to play the guitar… when you’re not ready for it. But that… that’s alright.</p>\n<p>PAUL: I don’t know, you know, I mean—</p>\n<p>GEORGE: I mean, we’ve got to do that in order to get the good bit.</p>\n<p>PAUL: Right, yeah.</p>\n<p>GEORGE: We’ve got to get through that bit of shit of the meeting until we get it together again.</p>\n<p>PAUL: [receptive] You know, I can see it just – so we’re just working.</p>\n<p>GEORGE: But – and also there’s so much to get out, you know…</p>\n<p>PAUL: Yeah, right.</p>\n<p>GEORGE: [sincere] And there’s nobody better to get it out with than us. For me, anyway, really. In my heart of hearts.</p>\n<p>PAUL: [long pause; reserved] Yeah.</p>\n<p>GEORGE: It should be where – you know, if you write a song, I feel as though I’ve wrote it. And mine versus – vice versa. You know, I mean – or to be involved, really, as much, as if… That was the good thing about the last album, [because] it’s the only album so far I’ve tried to get involved with.</p>\n<p>PAUL: Yeah.</p>\n<p>GEORGE: [inaudible]</p>\n<p>PAUL: Mm.</p>\n<p>GEORGE: The last one.</p>\n<h2 id=\"16\">1/6</h2>\n<p>January 6th, 1969 (Twickenham Film Studios, London): While waiting for the other Beatles to arrive, Paul plays ‘Oh! Darling’ on the piano for the first time in the studio.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>January 6th, 1969 (Twickenham Film Studios, London): John allies himself unquestioningly with Paul as the group tries out different lyric variations for the chorus of ‘Don’t Let Me Down’. George tries his best to offer his own input. (Note: This is the first part of an ongoing series breaking down that Paul and George argument in the Let It Be film documentary - the Lennon-McCartney team vs. Harrison. Judging by the session tapes, Paul seems to have had a surprising amount of creative involvement in what is essentially a John song. The dialogue that was eventually edited into the scene as depicted in the film is highlighted in bold.)</p>\n<p>GEORGE: If what you’re saying is what [John] said, then it’s easy, ’cause if you don’t know the words, then he tells you what you’re saying.</p>\n<p>PAUL: Yeah I know, but you see, like you said, it was corny before, and so to change the corniness, I was changing the words—</p>\n<p>GEORGE: Yeah, but the corny beginsel I thought was the notes that he was doing, you know, and the way he was doing it, not really what he was saying—</p>\n<p>PAUL: Yeah. So – okay.</p>\n<p>GEORGE: —and if it seems good, it doesn’t matter what—</p>\n<p>PAUL: What I’m trying to say is, you can get – I think you can get around the beginsel by singing the corny notes first, and having new words, and – you know. So I’m – but it’s like – so we still have to try and do it. So you still keep saying it’s wrong. Well, let’s try it. And then when we’ve tried it, then we can see if it’s wrong, you know.</p>\n<p>GEORGE: You already seem to have tried it a lot.</p>\n<p>PAUL: Yeah, I know, but we haven’t – we still haven’t done this. I’m in love for the first time in my life. “Don’t you know it’s gonna last.” [pause] “I’ll never let it get away.” [laughs] It’s a love that lasts forever…</p>\n<p>JOHN: “Forever and a day.”</p>\n<p>PAUL: Yeah. There’s some – there’s some new words there. And – and guitar–</p>\n<p>JOHN: I just haven’t tied to a way of singing yet.</p>\n<p>PAUL: No, that’s what I mean, you know, that’s all I want – to just have them–</p>\n<p>JOHN: Can you both do it, ’cause – okay.</p>\n<p>PAUL: Yeah. I’m in love for the first time…</p>\n<p>PAUL &#x26; GEORGE: For the first time in my life…</p>\n<p>JOHN: Don’t you know it’s gonna last…</p>\n<p>PAUL &#x26; GEORGE: Don’t ever let it get away…</p>\n<p>JOHN: It’s a love that lasts forever…</p>\n<p>GEORGE: I just wanna say— [playing halts]</p>\n<p>PAUL: [to George] I just want to get a bit – we’ll try, you know. We’ll go right through. But you keep talking about it.</p>\n<p>GEORGE: You see, if he was, say, if it was like— [plays different rhythm] Like that, you know. “You know it’s gonna last.”</p>\n<p>PAUL: [impatient] Yeah, sure, let’s just repeat whatever you say.</p>\n<p>GEORGE: Don’t you know it’s gonna last…</p>\n<p>JOHN &#x26; PAUL: I’m in love for the first time…</p>\n<p>PAUL &#x26; GEORGE: For the first time in my life…</p>\n<p>JOHN: Don’t you know it’s gonna last…</p>\n<p>PAUL &#x26; GEORGE: Don’t you know it’s gonna last…</p>\n<p>JOHN: It’s a love that lasts forever…</p>\n<p>PAUL &#x26; GEORGE: It’s a love that lasts forever…</p>\n<p>JOHN: It’s a love that has no past…</p>\n<p>PAUL &#x26; GEORGE: It’s a love that has no past…</p>\n<p>JOHN: Don’t let me down… [playing halts]</p>\n<p>PAUL: Okay, that’s – that’s alright. That’s—</p>\n<p>JOHN: Yes. [to George] I can’t hear you.</p>\n<p>GEORGE: Right.</p>\n<p>PAUL: No, uh—</p>\n<p>GEORGE: I think it’s awful. I’m trying to get it started—</p>\n<p>PAUL: Uh… okay.</p>\n<p>JOHN: [to George] Well, have you got anything? To supplant it?</p>\n<p>PAUL: [to George] Okay, yeah, come on. Do something better, then.</p>\n<p>GEORGE: Well, I just think that, you know– I think, for a start, it’d be better to sing – [plays descending chords] instead of— [plays repeating chords] Ah… For the first time…</p>\n<p>PAUL: Yeah, but see, in a way, that’s even cornier, I think. That – that little harmony bit, it’s just too – it’s too pretty.</p>\n<p>GEORGE: Well it’s just there’s one holding – it’s like that. [plays staggered chords] I mean at the moment, it’s just— [plays straight chords] And maybe it’s cornier if you do [plays staggered chords], a groove like that—\r\nPAUL: Yeah.</p>\n<p>GEORGE: But if it’s something like that— [plays sustained chords]</p>\n<p>PAUL: Okay. Now for the first time in my life… One, two, three – you take the lower one, then.</p>\n<p>JOHN: I’m in love for the first time…</p>\n<p>PAUL &#x26; GEORGE: I’m in love for the first time…</p>\n<p>JOHN: Don’t you know it’s gonna last…</p>\n<p>PAUL &#x26; GEORGE: Don’t you know it’s gonna last…</p>\n<p>JOHN: It’s a love that lasts forever…</p>\n<p>PAUL &#x26; GEORGE: It’s a love that lasts forever…</p>\n<p>JOHN: It’s a love that has no past!</p>\n<p>PAUL &#x26; GEORGE: It’s a love that has no past… [playing halts]</p>\n<p>GEORGE: I thought we should do something like this— [plays different rhythm]</p>\n<p>PAUL: No. You see—</p>\n<p>GEORGE: [continues playing] It’s a love that lasts forever, love that lasts forever, love that lasts forever…</p>\n<p>JOHN: [unconvinced] Yeah, well, that’s it. [pause] I think you should just get a corny one first, and then start doing that bit. You know, you’ll start to get the rhythm to it, and then sort of change it.</p>\n<p>GEORGE: [plays differently] Love that’s gonna last… Da da da da da da…</p>\n<p>PAUL: Yeah, that’s it. [George continues playing] Uh… [George’s playing halts] Let’s just sing, you know, the corny one. [laughs]</p>\n<p>JOHN: Yeah, do the corny one.</p>\n<p>PAUL: Just to get this bit, you know. And then we can like – you see, that’s it. We’ll make it better as it goes on.</p>\n<p>JOHN: Yeah. I mean – I—</p>\n<p>PAUL: But if we don’t, then it just doesn’t go on. You know, we’ve just gone round for like an hour, with nothing in our heads. Just— And we’re back, you know. So let’s—</p>\n<p>GEORGE: I can keep doing the permutations, then.</p>\n<p>PAUL: Yeah, I know, but let’s just sort of move on, now. Let’s just get this.</p>\n<p>JOHN: I’d like to hear any of ‘em – right ones.</p>\n<p>PAUL: Yeah. Right, okay. So repeat exactly what he says, but then we can’t, on one of the lines. So, I’m in love for the first time…</p>\n<p>GEORGE: See, that’s why you don’t get any further, because you just kept using the same lines against the one that doesn’t work—</p>\n<p>PAUL: [ignores] For the first time in my life…</p>\n<p>JOHN: Don’t you know it’s gonna last…</p>\n<p>GEORGE: [grudging] It’s a love that’s gonna last…</p>\n<p>JOHN: It’s a love that lasts forever…</p>\n<p>PAUL &#x26; GEORGE: It’s a love that lasts forever…</p>\n<p>JOHN: It’s a love that has no past… [playing halts] Love that lasts forever, love that lasts…</p>\n<p>PAUL: Okay, so how about, how about – changing ‘round these two, and when you sing, “don’t you know it’s gonna last,” we sing, “it’s a love that has no past.” And then we repeat, “it’s a love that lasts forever,” exactly. And then when you sing, “it’s a love that has no past,” we sing “it’s a love that’s gonna last.”</p>\n<p>JOHN: Yes. I agree.</p>\n<p>PAUL: Okay? So, I’m in love for the— “Love for the first time in my life.” “It’s a love that has no past.” Swap that\r\none for the other. So that when he’s singing that, we’re singing the other. Then, “it’s a love that lasts forever,” repeat that – even though it sounds funny, it’ll be alright. And then, “don’t you know it’s gonna last.” Just try it through, roughly.</p>\n<p>GEORGE: I’m trying to—</p>\n<p>PAUL: Listen – uh, uh.</p>\n<p>JOHN: I’m in love for the first time…</p>\n<p>PAUL &#x26; GEORGE: Love for the first time in my life…</p>\n<p>JOHN: Don’t you know it’s gonna last…</p>\n<p>PAUL &#x26; GEORGE: It’s a love that has no past…</p>\n<p>JOHN: It’s a love that lasts forever… [playing halts]</p>\n<p>PAUL: Okay, uh, The only time that works, really, is on the last line. So we sing, “love for the first time—” Just, just try it all exactly as it is. Repeating that. We’ll just on the last time. Sing, repeat, “it’s a love that’s gonna last,” and then you say, “it’s a love that has no past.”</p>\n<p>JOHN: Okay.</p>\n<p>PAUL: You see, it’s verging between ridiculous and alright, that, you know. Singing different words. ’Cause it is like—</p>\n<p>JOHN: That’s the bones of it, though. [inaudible; playing guitar] She’s in, she’s in pain, you know. [laughs]</p>\n<p>PAUL: [laughs] Okay.</p>\n<p>JOHN: I’m in love for the first time…</p>\n<p>PAUL &#x26; GEORGE: For the first time in my life…</p>\n<p>JOHN: Don’t you know it’s gonna last…</p>\n<p>PAUL &#x26; GEORGE: Don’t you know it’s gonna last…</p>\n<p>JOHN: It’s a love that lasts forever…</p>\n<p>PAUL &#x26; GEORGE: It’s a love that lasts forever…</p>\n<p>JOHN: It’s a love that has no past…</p>\n<p>PAUL &#x26; GEORGE: It’s a love that’s gonna last…</p>\n<p>GEORGE: Can I make a suggestion there, for the last line?</p>\n<p>PAUL: What?</p>\n<p>GEORGE: Well, forget the last line. It’s a love that lasts forever…</p>\n<p>PAUL: It’s a love that has no past… dun dun dun dun dun dun. Don’t let me down… Okay.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>January 6th, 1969 (Twickenham Film Studios, London): The Beatles run through the chorus of ‘Don’t Let Me Down’ and try to iron out the contentious problems with the arrangement. (Note: This is the second part of an ongoing series breaking down that Paul and George argument in the Let It Be film documentary. The dialogue that was eventually edited into the scene as depicted in the film is highlighted in bold. First part.)</p>\n<p>PAUL: So that’s – that’s near enough for the time being. [inaudible]</p>\n<p>JOHN: We’ve still got that hole, like at the—</p>\n<p>GEORGE: But really, it’s like that doesn’t sound all that… you know. I’m iffy on that.</p>\n<p>PAUL: Well, we’re gonna improve on that. But the—</p>\n<p>GEORGE: If we had a tape recorder now – just tape down, play it back, you’d throw that out straightaway.</p>\n<p>PAUL: Yeah, right, but—</p>\n<p>GEORGE: You know, really—</p>\n<p>PAUL: Yeah—</p>\n<p>GEORGE: —you’d throw it out right damn in—</p>\n<p>PAUL: Okay. Uh. Well, okay, that’s the—</p>\n<p>GEORGE: You know, it’s either be— I know, you know.</p>\n<p>PAUL: Yeah, I know, but you— [makes helpless sound]</p>\n<p>JOHN: [mediating] See, I think, there… [starts playing]</p>\n<p>PAUL: [to John] Give in!</p>\n<p>GEORGE: I’m in love for the first time…</p>\n<p>PAUL: I give in.</p>\n<p>JOHN: We’re right, but it’s wrong there, on that bit.</p>\n<p>GEORGE: You see, the first one’s not bad. [playing halts]</p>\n<p>JOHN: No, the thing that we’ve done is that we found out that’s the weak bit, right.</p>\n<p>PAUL: Yeah.</p>\n<p>JOHN: So we tried putting voices on it. But it’s still down to the rhythm, somehow. The ba— Love for the first time… [starts playing]</p>\n<p>PAUL: But it was always weak on your guitar.</p>\n<p>JOHN: [agreeing] Yeah, sure.</p>\n<p>PAUL: That’s the weak bit of the song, that.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>January 6th, 1969 (Twickenham Film Studios, London): John briefly invokes Little Richard’s ‘Send Me Some Lovin’’ as a musical guide for ‘Don’t Let Me Down’. (Note: You may listen to early-70s!John singing ‘Send Me Some Lovin’’ here.)</p>\n<hr>\n<p>January 6th, 1969 (Twickenham Film Studios, London): John offhandedly asks if he’s supposed to sing on ‘Two Of Us’, prompting Paul to run through the song sharing vocals with John for the first time.</p>\n<p>JOHN: Am I singing on this, or what?</p>\n<p>PAUL: I don’t know, really. [pause] Melody. Two of us… You have to remember the words too.</p>\n<p>JOHN: Yes, I’ve got ’em here.</p>\n<p>PAUL: Well, learn ’em.</p>\n<p>JOHN: Yeah. [pause] I almost know ’em.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>January 6th, 1969 (Twickenham Film Studios, London): Paul and George have a fraught and ultimately sad exchange about responsibilities, expectations, and means to ends, with John in the uncommon role as mediator trying to move the sessions along. An increasingly anxious and self-conscious Paul is aware of his own tendency to direct the rehearsals but confesses himself at a loss for any other way to keep everyone productive, in tune, and in pace with their looming deadline without encroaching on everyone else’s egos, emotions, and individual working methods. George capitulates, contends his inability to conform to their current circumstances with Paul’s inability to compromise, and wonders despondently if Paul even knows what he really wants (for this project, for the group and its individual members, or for himself). (Note: This is the third part of a series breaking down that Paul and George argument in the Let It Be film documentary. The dialogue that was eventually edited into the scene as depicted in the film is highlighted in bold. First part, second part.)</p>\n<p>PAUL: You see, we’re really – we’re gonna have to sorta bring it together, because we’re all at odds, we’re doing that thing we did on The Beatles, we’re all playing, you know, like… [incoherent] Like in this verse, it’s two harmonies singing, trying to say some words, right. So like you know, you can just, duh duh dun… ch cha. And in the bits, when we need bits, we’re not—</p>\n<p>JOHN: Yeah I know the bits. I’m just trying to sing it, and do it through.</p>\n<p>PAUL: [plays] You know what I mean? We’ve got to get riffs, when the riff bits come up.</p>\n<p>GEORGE: The riffs. Uh, there’s no riffs. I mean, it’s nice to get – just to get what you’re playing—</p>\n<p>PAUL: No, but it’s just, look – you see, “you and I”, uh – on—</p>\n<p>GEORGE: You and I, our memories…</p>\n<p>PAUL: Uh, but it’s not – it’s not together, you see, so it’s not sounding together. Even on—</p>\n<p>GEORGE: So we can only play until we – until we can find the bit—</p>\n<p>PAUL: Or we can stop and say it’s not together.</p>\n<p>GEORGE: Yes, then you’ve got to carry on until we get it together. So I mean, that’s all, that’s all I can do is play—</p>\n<p>PAUL: Okay. Well, I, you know—</p>\n<p>GEORGE: —until it sounds as though it’s blending with the rest—</p>\n<p>PAUL: I never know what to say to that, you know, ’cause what I want to say is now come on, and play… you know.</p>\n<p>GEORGE: Yes, I know.</p>\n<p>PAUL: But I can’t, you know, because we get into that line.</p>\n<p>GEORGE: It does.</p>\n<p>PAUL: Okay. [laughs nervously] So, here we go. [starts playing] You know, I mean, well. Tell us something about that. I can’t make it eyond that. It’s like, it’s – it’s complicated now. So. See, if we can get simpler, and then complicate it where it needs complications, but it’s complicated in the bit—</p>\n<p>GEORGE: It’s not complicated. I’m just gonna—</p>\n<p>PAUL: I know, but I mean – you know.</p>\n<p>GEORGE: I mean, I’ll play just the chords, if you’ll like, and—</p>\n<p>PAUL: [hushed] No, come on, you always get like—</p>\n<p>GEORGE: —and then – but that’s all I’m trying to do—</p>\n<p>PAUL: [anxious] You always get annoyed when I say that. I’m – I’m trying to help, you know, but I always hear myself annoying you, and I’m trying to—</p>\n<p>GEORGE: No, you’re not annoying me.</p>\n<p>PAUL: —I get so I can’t say—</p>\n<p>GEORGE: [acquiescent] You don’t annoy me [anymore?].</p>\n<p>PAUL: But you know what I mean. You know, well, do this, then. [plays] And then… I don’t know. [long pause] Yeah. I can’t do it on film, either. [laughs; bleak] I don’t know if I can do it on camera. [long silence; guitar playing]</p>\n<p>JOHN: Do you want me to keep this up? [plays riff] ’Cause I’m trying to find something that’s nice to sing to—</p>\n<p>PAUL: Yeah, you see, I don’t mind—</p>\n<p>JOHN: Yeah, and—</p>\n<p>PAUL: —but doesn’t everyone agree that it’s confused at the moment?</p>\n<p>JOHN: Yeah.</p>\n<p>PAUL: So all I’m trying to say is – is like, let’s get the confusion unconfusing, and then confuse it. You know, like, we’re just – this is what we’ve been doing all afternoon. This is why we’re not getting anything done. You know, we’re just rolling on with it. We’ve only got twelve more days. So you know, we’ve really got to do this methodically, this one. Like unconfused, then a bit more confused, then a bit more, now try this drumming here, try this drumming there, now okay, let’s stop and go look into this bit—</p>\n<p>JOHN: Well, I’ve got an idea. I should vamp, ’cause I’ve got to sing, and it’s hard going— [plays rhythm]</p>\n<p>PAUL: Doing that?</p>\n<p>JOHN: But it’s annoying, you know. And let me do it— [plays rhythm]</p>\n<p>PAUL: Okay, can you do that—</p>\n<p>JOHN: I’ll do just that kind of vamping. [plays rhythm]</p>\n<p>PAUL: Yeah. [laughs] Drag it halfway through candid camera. [long pause; listening to John playing] Yeah.</p>\n<p>JOHN: [reassuring] Forget about candid camera.</p>\n<p>PAUL: [wan] Can’t, though. [quietly; to George] But you see we’ve been saying— [inaudible] —a lot of, uh— [inaudible] —that I can do about. You know, it’s like I’ve always found that – but I always feel it, though, like you think I’m trying to put you down, or stop you from playing, but I’m not. I’m trying to stop us all playing, until we know what we’re playing.</p>\n<p>GEORGE: Yeah, but you’ve got to play it in order to find which fits and which doesn’t.</p>\n<p>PAUL: Mm.</p>\n<p>GEORGE: You see, that’s all you can do in this—</p>\n<p>PAUL: But it’s like – I know, but I’m thinking of this other thing which is where we’re playing the solos. We’re improvising the solos, but we’ll play strict chords and strict rhythms.</p>\n<p>GEORGE: Yeah.</p>\n<p>PAUL: Without the vocals.</p>\n<p>GEORGE: [inaudible; drowned out by playing]</p>\n<p>PAUL: You know, but I don’t want to say it, because I really just hear myself as being the only one saying it. Always. And I just basically sort of sit there, like— [inaudible; drowned out by playing] —and I never get any support or anything. So I just think, “Oh well. [inaudible]” You know. It’s right. [to John] And you know it’s right.</p>\n<p>JOHN: [consenting] Yes, alright, but I just don’t know what to do about it.</p>\n<p>PAUL: Well, you know.</p>\n<p>JOHN: You know, I mean, up ’til then—</p>\n<p>GEORGE: I mean, I’ll wait until you figure out your bits and then work my part out, if you like.</p>\n<p>PAUL: No no no—</p>\n<p>GEORGE: It’s like that, it’s like a matter of working it out with you while you’re working your bit out. You know, if you’ve got your bass bit. [plays] You know, I mean, so. It just would—</p>\n<p>PAUL: I know, I know, but I’m—</p>\n<p>GEORGE: Because it’ll take even longer in a way, if there—</p>\n<p>PAUL: Look, I’m not trying to say that, and I’m not trying to say that about you. You know, you’re doing this again as though I’m trying to say that, and what we said the other day, you know – I’m not trying to get [at] you. But what I really am trying to just say is, “Look, lads.” The band, you know. “Should we try it like this?” You know.</p>\n<p>GEORGE: It’s funny now how it only occurs when you put the – on—</p>\n<p>PAUL: I know, if this one is like, “Should we play guitar all through ‘Hey Jude’?” Well, I don’t think we should,\r\nbut—</p>\n<p>GEORGE: Well, okay, I don’t mind, I’ll play, you know, whatever you want me to play. Or I won’t play at all, if you don’t want me to play. Now, whatever it is that will please you, I’ll do it. [pause] But I don’t think you really know what that one is. [long pause; playing]</p>\n<p>JOHN: [hedging] But do you want to take the [inaudible]?</p>\n<p>GEORGE: [singing quietly] Going nowhere…</p>\n<p>PAUL: [exasperated] No, okay, but don’t – come on. Look, you know—</p>\n<p>JOHN: The galloping bit. And I’ll just vamp.</p>\n<p>PAUL: Look, you know, the… [sighs] No, it’s not like that. You see, that’s it, it’s like, we can’t do this. We’ve really got to sort out this, ’cause we’re – this is  – we’re like – this is the one, you know. Now we’re rehearsing, and we’re trying to like get it together for a TV show, so we really – like you said, we’ve only been through four numbers, you know.</p>\n<p>GEORGE: Mm.</p>\n<p>JOHN: Well…</p>\n<p>PAUL: So we’ve probably got to get some system to get through like twenty, or thirty, and no more, and have learnt them. And it’s probably going to be like sculpture. So that we get all the chords. So we can all vamp and all. Then we can all play, like, every solo we need. But like… You know what I mean? It’s got to sound as though it’s improving.</p>\n<p>GEORGE: [careful] Yeah, well, it actually – it sounded to me, that for me, it was a waste of me time playing, when we started it today. I mean, I just started remembering then what it could get into the other day, after playing for around an hour, an hour and a half. And suddenly, you know, I just don’t find that my – that what I’m doing is starting to have something, you know. Have some structure to it. [pause] You know, that’s the thing.</p>\n<p>PAUL: Yeah, I know, I know what you mean, you know. ’Cause it’s like—</p>\n<p>GEORGE: You know, I mean—</p>\n<p>PAUL: It’s just that that way of doing it, you know, puts me off the way I’m trying to do it, and—</p>\n<p>GEORGE: [resigned] Well, that’s – you know. That’s all, then. I can only do me, in that one way, however I do it,\r\nyou know. [long pause]</p>\n<p>PAUL: [resigned] Let’s do another song.</p>\n<p>GEORGE: [commiserating] No, come on, we just have to learn this—</p>\n<p>PAUL: No, no, it’s – let’s just do something else.</p>\n<p>GEORGE: Do you want to do… ‘Maxwell Silver Hammer’?</p>\n<p>JOHN: [encouraging] Well, let’s do this, ’cause then we – we’re gonna come to this, or whatever it is. And the thing is just try and think what – the stage we’ve got to be in then.</p>\n<p>PAUL: You just have to know that. I think we’ve wasted a lot of time, I think. I think we do like waste, physically waste a heck of a lot of time, you know, when the four of us are together.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>January 6th, 1969 (Twickenham Film Studios, London): In a discussion with John, Paul acknowledges the reluctant leadership role in the band he’s found himself in for the past few years and worries how the convergence of anxiety and authority in his direction may be hurting the group as a whole. John tries to reassure him otherwise, and George tries to meet him.</p>\n<p>GEORGE: But that’s like, I’ve learnt that bit, and I’m trying to – I’m trying to take that – those chords along with it…</p>\n<p>PAUL: [inaudible; drowned out by George’s voice] I’m not trying to – I only want to ask you. You know.</p>\n<p>JOHN: I think, it’s your song. And you’ve gotta— [inaudible] —gotta have it exactly how he wants to do it, you know. If you say, “Don’t play that, play that,” it’s up to you, you know. You sort of take it. ’Cause it’s your scene. If somebody’s gonna ask for [inaudible], it’s his song.</p>\n<p>PAUL: But now I – now I’m scared of that. To be the boss. And I – and I have been, for like, uh, a couple of years.\r\nAnd we all have, you know. There’s no pretending about that.</p>\n<p>JOHN: Yeah I know, but – but this—</p>\n<p>PAUL: And no one is [the boss]. That is what we decided, you know. And no one is—</p>\n<p>JOHN: But it’s all in—</p>\n<p>PAUL: And no one’s – you know how rush— [audio cuts off] —and this is why, you know, it’s chaos—</p>\n<p>GEORGE: You don’t boss out on us. It’s fine.</p>\n<p>PAUL: Until it sort of… That’s why we take so long! Because, really, you know, and we get sort of – so that’s the thing. We can play it shitty and all. I – I think we can play it shitty like ten times, so it’s sort of in there, and then I think we can kind of play it quite good, then. But it’s only – I don’t know, it’s just like different approaches, you know. I think we’d be better just learn, just doing it all, like uh, you know, the Red Norvo Five. Just really, like, uh—</p>\n<p>GEORGE: Vamping away.</p>\n<p>PAUL: Vamping, sort of efficient vamping, really, you know, and then get the imaginative thing. You know. [pauses] But anyway, I know it’s impossible for us to go like – because we can’t get into the moment, ’cause you don’t do it like that, and— [plays riff]</p>\n<p>GEORGE: I know, and I’m trying, but— [plays]</p>\n<p>PAUL: No no no I mean, just, generally… [John sings ‘Two Of Us’ under his breath] It’s like when you’ve been trying to get me to do it and I do it. And that’s how I do it, but that’s not how you do it. [everyone plays]</p>\n<p>JOHN: [laughs; stops playing] See, I suppose that’s how they do it.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>January 6th, 1969 (Twickenham Film Studios, London): Paul, more out of desperation than decisiveness, proposes they resolve everyone’s conflicting working methods by allowing each one of them have undivided creative direction over their own compositions (which the others would then have to follow). George agrees with this solution, but John (having always had a more instinctive approach, as opposed to building songs brick by deliberate brick) suggests they continue to improvise. Paul briefly muses about the metaphysical nature of this discord.</p>\n<p>PAUL: [inaudible; drowned out by guitar] —of seeing yourself nearly go round a past you’ve been down too many times, you know I go down it, you know, like us going on about this. I really don’t want to go back to that. And it’s just silly. And I just can’t think of any solution out of here. The problem is that we should all arrange our own tunes, and if you want improvisation, then we should just say, you know, right, and—</p>\n<p>GEORGE: That’s the best way.</p>\n<p>PAUL: —and we improvise here. But look, it puts on much more work on each one of us, then, because then you’ve got to work out my bassline.</p>\n<p>JOHN: I’d say improvise it, like.</p>\n<p>PAUL: Yeah. [laughs bleakly] It’s like a bunch of theories, isn’t it? It’s like, it’s not just to do with playing music, this. It’s far further reaching, this sort of – this thing, you know.</p>\n<p>GEORGE: It’s always the far reaching end of it. It stems from the mad thing they call— [audio cuts off]</p>\n<h2 id=\"17\">1/7</h2>\n<h3 id=\"golden-slumbers--carry-that-weight\">‘Golden Slumbers’ / ‘Carry That Weight’</h3>\n<p>January 7th, 1969: In the morning, Paul sings ‘Golden Slumbers’ and ‘Carry That Weight’ by himself while waiting for the other Beatles to arrive in the studio.</p>\n<h3 id=\"i-think-weve-got-a-bit-shy-you-know-i-think-ive-got-a-bit-shy-of--certain-things-you-know\">I think we’ve got a bit shy, you know. I think I’ve got a bit shy of – certain things, you know.</h3>\n<p>January 7th, 1969: As Let It Be filmmaker Michael Lindsay-Hogg discusses how The Beatles should hold their show, Paul tries anxiously to rouse up some enthusiasm from the rest of the group - encouraging George to see the fun in performing onstage again, and relating futilely to John’s interests - to little avail. Or response. (Note: This vague idea for a show eventually turned into the iconic rooftop concert. The song George is singing at the beginning is Bob Dylan’s ‘My Back Pages’.)</p>\n<p>PAUL: But we had a lot more incentive, then.</p>\n<p>GEORGE: Ah, but I was so much older then… I’m younger than that now…</p>\n<p>PAUL: But we really don’t need— You know, those films of us [back then]– that was us doing it, you know.</p>\n<p>GEORGE: [chagrined] Well, if that’s what doing it is, that’s why I don’t want to do it.</p>\n<p>PAUL: Yeah. Yeah, I think—</p>\n<p>GEORGE: Because I never liked that. It was always a drag.</p>\n<p>PAUL: [upset] Yeah, but – right. You know. You know, uh— [faltering] You see, that – that takes the thing, and – and twists it a bit.</p>\n<p>GEORGE: Well, it does, because I never liked that. That’s why I—</p>\n<p>PAUL: Well, you see, nowadays, you’ve grown up. And you don’t have to do that anymore.</p>\n<p>GEORGE: Yeah.</p>\n<p>PAUL: You see, that’s it. You don’t have to do – put the pancake [makeup] up, and go out in front and sweat, and shake our heads, because we’re not that anymore. We’ve grown up a bit.</p>\n<p>GEORGE: Because we’ve done that anyway.</p>\n<p>PAUL: Yeah, right. So what I mean is, we did it then, but it doesn’t mean, like, to do it again, we have to do all that.</p>\n<p>MICHAEL: Right.</p>\n<p>PAUL: Because now, like – for him to do it, is do it in a black bag with Yoko, you know. [to John] And – and you’re doing it. [pause] I suppose.</p>\n<p>GEORGE: White bag.</p>\n<p>MICHAEL: A white bag.</p>\n<p>PAUL: White bag. [pause; to John] But that’s it, you’re doing it, then, on this level, you know. But – you know. I mean, I—</p>\n<p>MICHAEL: But do you see it as – do you still want to perform for an audience, or do you just see yourselves sort of as recording people?</p>\n<p>PAUL: I think—</p>\n<p>MICHAEL: You see, but I think John’s right. It’s communication. And I think part of communication is seeing you doing it.</p>\n<p>PAUL: I think there’s something to do with an audience, there, yeah. I think – [pause] I think we’ve got a bit shy, you know. I think I’ve got a bit shy of – certain things, you know. And it’s like, uh – it is like that. It’s like, um—</p>\n<p>MICHAEL: I guess maybe the difficulty is also getting up in front of an audience, if – all you’ve done in front of an audience is trying to get something as good, but maybe not the same thing. You know, and it’s a very hard thing to get back. In other words, you musn’t think of getting back what you had. Because you don’t want—</p>\n<p>PAUL: No, that’s what Yoko was saying the other day, you know. We don’t – we musn’t try and get in the audience, and get them wild, and get—</p>\n<p>MICHAEL: Although they may be. [inaudible] Because they’ve grown up as well. I mean, everyone in this room has grown up.</p>\n<p>PAUL: Yeah.</p>\n<p>MICHAEL: You know what I mean?</p>\n<p>PAUL: Sure, yeah. That’s – that’s what’s great about it, you know. That’s why I don’t think we need to sort of play down, or do anything – we’ve really got to do what we do, but like, with the same kind of… No, it’s not even – it’s not even discipline, it’s the same kind of—</p>\n<p>MICHAEL: Drive.</p>\n<p>PAUL: Dr– desire to do it.</p>\n<p>MICHAEL: Desire. To do it.</p>\n<p>PAUL: You know, it’s like – it’s like all these songs, you know. There are some really great songs, and I just hope we don’t blow any of them. [to John] Because you know how often like on albums we sometimes blow one of your songs, because we come in in the wrong mood, and uh, you say, “This is how it goes, I’ll be back.” And we’re all just, [flustered voice] “Oh, uh, you—” Chuga chuga chuga chuga…</p>\n<p>MICHAEL: That’s why we’re wrong to throw away the show. Because there’s no desire –  I mean like, sure, I think I, M. L. H., can do a show with you better than anybody in the world, because I’ve got to be the best rock’n’roll director in the world, he says without any false humility. But equally, at the moment, we haven’t got a show, and so none of us are gonna want to do it.</p>\n<p>PAUL: Yeah, I know what you—</p>\n<p>MICHAEL: And the trouble is, that is why George was saying – he’s saying, “None of us want to do a show, because it ain’t a show.” And it’s like—\r\nPAUL: Yeah.</p>\n<p>MICHAEL: —we’ve got to find something else to go out and do it.</p>\n<p>GEORGE: And it’s that thing about – of the songs, too, you know. ‘Cause really, I don’t want to do any of my songs on the show, because I know they’ll always just turn out shitty, like—</p>\n<p>PAUL: No, but you see – no, see, this is where I think, though—</p>\n<p>GEORGE: Because, uh, they come out like a compromise, whereas in a studio they can—</p>\n<p>PAUL: [anxious] But you see – look, George—</p>\n<p>GEORGE: —work on ‘em, ‘til you want ‘em… and get it out of your mind.</p>\n<p>PAUL: Last year, you were telling me, that, “You can do anything you want, Paul.”</p>\n<p>GEORGE: Yeah.</p>\n<p>PAUL: “Anything you desire, you can do,” you know.</p>\n<p>GEORGE: Yeah.</p>\n<p>PAUL: Now, but these days—</p>\n<p>GEORGE: But you have to desire it.</p>\n<p>PAUL: [trying] But you’re saying – before this show is finished, before we’ve done it— Now, like the arrow, letting forth, is letting forth on this word of, “We’re not going to be able to do it, we’re going to come out a compromise.” Now, I don’t think that! I really don’t. I think you – we’ve done it, you know. I think we’ve – I really think we’re very good. And we can get it together, if we think that we want to do these songs great, we can just do it great, you know. But I think thinking it’s not going to come out great won’t help.</p>\n<p>GEORGE: Yeah.</p>\n<p>PAUL: You know, that’s like – that is like meditation, where you just – you get into a bummer, and you come out of\r\nit. You don’t go through it, you know.</p>\n<p>RINGO: Yeah.</p>\n<p>PAUL: I think we can, like, help, if we – you know, on anything like that. [to Ringo] If – so, okay, if you’re sick of playing the drums, we’ve all gotta say, “Look, we’re sick too, you know, pat pat, look, you know, it’s all the same,” and… we go through it with you. It’s no use just saying, “Well, fuck off, then.” “Oh, fuck that.” You know? What’s good, that?</p>\n<h3 id=\"i-mean-ill--ill-sit-in-a-corner-with-mal-on-the-tour-or-ill-sit-here-and-ill--ill-anything-cause-i--i-enjoy-it-all-thats-the-only-thing-i-enjoy-actually\">I mean, I’ll – I’ll sit in a corner with Mal, on the tour, or I’ll sit here, and I’ll – I’ll anything. ’Cause I – I enjoy it all. That’s the only thing I enjoy, actually.</h3>\n<p>January 7th, 1969 (Twickenham Studios, London): While Let It Be director Michael Lindsay-Hogg tries to engage the band in discussion about their proposed concert/television special, Paul tries anxiously to talk to John (who has been wordlessly strumming his guitar for the past half-hour) about performing together onstage again.</p>\n<p>GEORGE: It would be nice – you see, uh, if we’re just singing these songs – for me to watch it, I’d be bored if it was, “Oh, haha, thank you, now we’d like to do…” and all that. Or if it was like just edited from – you know, clap clap, bam, and you know, like that, like they do those films, that would be better.</p>\n<p>PAUL: See, there is that possibility too, which is the one I originally thought this was going to be, actually. Which was not to have a documentary, but to have the show – have documentary and show, just intercut. But it’s not as good as – it’s half arsed. It’s two ideas in one, because neither of ‘em is good enough.</p>\n<p>MICHAEL: If it comes off – if this comes off, we’ve got great chaps, we’ve got a great entertainment package in an album, a documentary never seen before, and a performance. It’s a great package.</p>\n<p>GEORGE: Yeah, you know, I mean, a lot could come out of it if we could get the enthusiasm and the strength to do it.</p>\n<p>MICHAEL: See, I think that the truest thing is if we – if we get it together.</p>\n<p>PAUL: [upset; to John] I mean, I’ll – I’ll sing in a corner with Mal on the tour, or I’ll sit here, and I’ll – I’ll anything. ’Cause I – I enjoy it all. That’s the only thing I enjoy, actually. [inaudible; drowned out by George’s and Michael’s voices] It’s terrible just to – I mean, imagine if you – if you were the only one interested. And I’m not easing it in, easing it in right now. I know you’re interested in that. But you won’t say anything to me about it.</p>\n<p>JOHN: [long pause] I said what I’d been thinking. I would. And that is what I have.</p>\n<p>PAUL: [tired] Are you still thinking that now? What are you thinking now?</p>\n<p>JOHN: [evasive] I’m still thinking about it. [continues playing]</p>\n<h3 id=\"we--we-havent-played-together-you-see-thats-the-fucking-thing-but-when-we-do-come-together-to-play-together-we-all-just-sort-of-talk-about-the-fleeting-past-were-like-old-age-pensioners-remember-the-days-when-we-used-to-rock-you-know-but-were-here-now-we-can-do-it-you-know\">We – we haven’t played together, you see! That’s the fucking thing. But when we do come together to play together, we all just sort of talk about the fleeting past! We’re like old-age pensioners! “Remember the days when we used to rock?” You know, but we’re here now! We can do it, you know.</h3>\n<p>January 7th, 1969 (Twickenham Film Studios, London): An increasingly exasperated Paul yells into the immovable and unspeaking void despairs about everyone’s commitment to this project and to making music together in general, bemoans their seeming inability to communicate openly and honestly with one another (and resorting to using Neil Aspinall and others as a conduit), and fears the worst about the Beatles’ future if this continues. Mal Evans and filmmaker Michael Lindsay-Hogg insist that staying together would be good not just for the band itself but for the world at large.</p>\n<p>MICHAEL: ’Cause otherwise, there isn’t any point in doing it. I don’t mean – I don’t mean us copping out in any way. I just mean, we oughta make – if we’re gonna do it, we oughta make it… very good. Stop me when – stop me when I’m— [inaudible]</p>\n<p>PAUL: It’s like Mal said last night. “If you’re gonna do the show here, you’ve got to decide today.” And he sort of said it, almost frightened to say it, you know, to the lads. Didn’t really want to sort of shout at us. Didn’t want – but he had to say it, because if you do the show, you’re gonna have to decide today, you know, and it’s like that. And it’s like if you’re gonna do these songs, you’ve got to learn the chords. And we all know them. And we’ve got to learn the words. It’s just certain basic things that we’ve got to do, if we’re gonna do it. See, and as far as I can see there’s only two ways, and that’s what I was shouting about the last meeting we had. There’s only two things, you know. We’re gonna do it, or we’re not gonna do it. And I want a decision. Because I’m – I’m not interested enough to come to spend so many days farting around here while everyone makes up their minds about whether they want to do it or not, you know. I’ll do it. If everyone else will, and everyone wants to do it, then alright. [laughs bleakly] But it’s just a bit – a bit soft, you know? It’s—</p>\n<p>MICHAEL: The point is—</p>\n<p>PAUL: It’s like a school, you know, you’ve got to be here! And I haven’t. I haven’t, you know, I’ve… see, I’ve left school. We’ve all left school, and we don’t have to go. But it gets into a scene where you do have to go there.</p>\n<p>MICHAEL: No, you see the first thing to get together is yourselves, totally. And then we all follow with our kit bags and our campers.</p>\n<p>PAUL: So it’s like if we’re doing the show right now, we’re gonna have to work hard, and we’re gonna have to even think about how many songs that we’ll today have to have rehearsed, in order to by five days before it, to know ’em all. Now, five days before it is a week from now. And that means by the time a week from now comes, all these songs we’ve got, we’ve gotta know perfectly, and then [for] five days we’ll really, really get us to know it. You know, but I mean, there’s no – there’s no use to sort of waiting for the players themselves until we’ve got to put off the date and [inaudible] it to the cameras and say, “Don’t, we can’t have the cameras now.” [pause] It’s not like that, is it? [long pause] See, apathy’s alright, if— [inaudible; drowned out by George’s and George Martin’s voices]</p>\n<p>MICHAEL: [inaudible] —anyway.</p>\n<p>PAUL: That’s alright, it’s allowed.</p>\n<p>MICHAEL: Yeah, sure.</p>\n<p>PAUL: [inaudlble] —if it’s supposed to be opposite then you shouldn’t— [inaudible]</p>\n<p>MICHAEL: So it’s, “Everybody, pull your socks up”?</p>\n<p>PAUL: Sure it is, you know. Yeah I—</p>\n<p>MICHAEL: The first day was the best musical day, for me it was a musical day, yeah. Because you routined about four numbers. [long pause]</p>\n<p>PAUL: But I must say I’ll get, uh, put down, ’cause you know. Like if certain people aren’t interested, then I do… I lose interest. [long pause] And we can’t blame our tours or anything, or so on and so on and so on. [long pause] You see this one, that we’ve been having, this year, makes me really want to—</p>\n<p>GEORGE: Last year. Last year.</p>\n<p>PAUL: —snap out of it. Or snap into it. De-plastic it. But the past couple of months, you know, it’s been this, but the [White] album was like this, you see. The album was worse than this. This just seems sort of—</p>\n<p>MICHAEL: What, agony?</p>\n<p>PAUL: Well, just the whole idea of, do you want to do it? Do we want to do it? And that’s the joke, you see. After it all came about, Neil was saying to me we’d all phoned him individually, saying things like, you know, “Can you get ‘em together?” “Can you get it – oh, can you get it together?” “I want to know, what’re we doing?” You know. But like, instead of asking each other, we’ve all gone to Neil and asked him, “What’re the lads doing?” But you know, we should just have it out.</p>\n<p>GEORGE: But we keep coming up again, that one. And like you were saying, “Yeah well I’d like to do this, this, and that, yeah, and I’d like to do this, and I’d like to do that, and I’d like to do that,” and we end up doing something again that nobody really wants to do. [laughs]</p>\n<p>PAUL: Well then, you know, I think if this one—</p>\n<p>GEORGE: Make it public, at that.</p>\n<p>PAUL: Maybe it should definitely be the last for all of us. Because there just isn’t any point [inaudible]—</p>\n<p>GEORGE: Yeah, that’s it. [long pause]</p>\n<p>MICHAEL: I think I’d be sad. I mean, as an audience member, I’d be sad.</p>\n<p>PAUL: Of course it is! It’s stupid, you know! It is just stupid. But, it’s even more stupid the other way. To go through it. Because – you know.</p>\n<p>MICHAEL: I agree, but it’s—</p>\n<p>GEORGE: ’Cause this time we could be using for what you want to be doing—</p>\n<p>PAUL: You see, the thing is the people who are being stupid are the four of us. There’s nobody else. There’s only the four of us. You can’t actually, you know just sort of blame it on – ’cause there’s no other band, you know!</p>\n<p>GEORGE: —and being creative, instead of being like in the doldrums, which it always is now…</p>\n<p>MICHAEL: I wrote in my book, because I kind of keep a diary about what’s going on so I can cut it, and “doldrums” was the word I used. Because the doldrums have been coming, like – like to a ship on a [inaudible]—</p>\n<p>GEORGE: Oh, The Beatles have been in doldrums for at least a year.</p>\n<p>MICHAEL: You see, that is – that is terrible to say.</p>\n<p>PAUL: [desperate] We – we haven’t played together, you see! That’s the fucking thing. But when we do come together to play together, we all just sort of talk about the fleeting past! We’re like old-age pensioners! “Remember the days when we used to rock?” You know, but we’re here now! We can do it, you know. But I mean, I’m – all I hoping for is enthusiasm from you so—</p>\n<p>MICHAEL: That was – that was the idea—</p>\n<p>MAL: [earnest] I’d just like to say that you are needed, you know. The Beatles are needed. To so many people, you know.</p>\n<p>MICHAEL: Yeah, you’re right.</p>\n<p>MAL: Whatever you do.</p>\n<p>PAUL: You see the thing is also I – I get to a bit where I just sort of push all my ideas and I know that my ideas aren’t the best, you know. They are [mechanical voice] good, good, but they’re not the best, you know. But we can improve on it. Because we write songs together, and we improve on it. You know. [to Ringo] And you can improve on your drumming like it is, if you get into it. If you don’t, you know, okay, then I have better ideas, but if you get into it, you’re better! You know. It’s like that.</p>\n<p>GEORGE: And after all that, it’s like, you know, what do they say? It comes from a – and the eaves springs out of an E—</p>\n<p>MICHAEL: An ear.</p>\n<p>GEORGE: And that’s, you know, all that existentialist crap. [laughs]</p>\n<p>MICHAEL: Just like Jean-Paul, yeah, exactly.</p>\n<p>GEORGE: You know, it’s like…</p>\n<p>MICHAEL: You can call him John-Paul George, as opposed to Jean-Paul Sartre, you know. [laughs] We have a joke over here. You heard that, did you hear? Call him John-Paul George, as opposed to Jean-Paul Sartre, as a weird existentialism. [pause] Um, yeah. Like, it’s communication. And I think – I mean, see corny’s great, and like Mal said, it’s so corny that such a – I mean, he didn’t put it [as] corny, but it’s – you are terribly corny. [pause; scattered laughter] And that is what the world… [George starts singing ‘What The World Needs Now Is Love’] I mean really, ’cause – everyone in the world can say what they think except for you. We all need you. And you know, it’s the tears coming in the eyes of the little boy sitting in London as opposed to the little girl in America. And it’s communication. And it iss communication. And if you all can’t get it together, that’s really very sad. So, I feel what we should do now is let you play a little, and then you’ll have lunch together, and I can give you some more film, maybe. [pause]</p>\n<p>PAUL: Yes.</p>\n<p>MICHAEL: So, should we leave you for a while? I mean, if you—</p>\n<p>PAUL: Yes, yeah.</p>\n<h3 id=\"maybe-we-should-have-a-divorce\">Maybe we should have a divorce.</h3>\n<p>January 7th, 1969: George talks about being treated like an equal, and in light of the worsening member relations, suggests The Beatles disband for good.</p>\n<p>GEORGE: Well, what I was saying about the songs was like, the reason, you know, like, I’ve got about twenty songs from 1948 was because I knew very well the moment I’d bring them in the studio, that – [blows raspberry] there it’s gone, you know.</p>\n<p>PAUL: Yeah.</p>\n<p>GEORGE: And, uh, so I never did. And, like, slowly now, I can bring a couple out because I can get it more like how it should have been then. And that’s – you know, it’s like, it’s just…</p>\n<p>PAUL: You see, but it doesn’t matter what’s going wrong. It really doesn’t matter what’s going wrong, as long as the four of us notice it.</p>\n<p>GEORGE: [disbelieving; laughs] Well, I’ve noticed it, alright.</p>\n<p>PAUL: No, but and – and – instead of just noticing it, determine to put it right, you know. [pause] ‘Cause that’s what I’m – that’s what I’m onto.</p>\n<p>GEORGE: Maybe we should have a divorce.</p>\n<p>PAUL: Well, I said that last week, you know. But it’s getting nearer.</p>\n<p>JOHN: Who’d have the children?</p>\n<p>PAUL: [pause] Dick James.</p>\n<p>JOHN: Oh, yeah.</p>\n<h3 id=\"you-know-me-were-all--were-all-alike-here-us-four-but-we-just-dont-sort-of-get-to-talk-it-out-with-each-other\">You know me. We’re all – we’re all alike, here, us four. But we just don’t sort of get to talk it out with each other.</h3>\n<p>January 7th, 1969 (Twickenham Film Studios, London): A despairing Paul avows his own resolve to continue working and taking whatever challenge is offered (such as this prospective television concert/documentary project) for as long as it keeps the band going, and is baffled and dismayed by the others’ seeming ambivalence (if not outright aversion) to their current circumstances. He calls John out on his obtuseness and incapability to talk with him openly and honestly, and upon receiving no response, relents and admits that this criticism applies to himself as well.</p>\n<p>PAUL: ’Cause you know, that’s what I was telling you on the phone, that… I’ll do it. Just because it is so silly of us now, at this point in our lives, to crack up. It’s just so silly. Because there’s no point! We’re not going to get anywhere that we wanna get by doing that. The only possible direction is the other way from that, you know. [pause] You know. That is the only possible direction. But the thing is we’re all just theoretically agreeing with it and not doing it. [to John] You’re doing your bit through you and Yoko, you know, but it’s silly, you know, to sort of, uh, coming and talking down to us. Well, actually your way out is not to talk, rather than talk down to us, which you’d have to do, you’d think, but you wouldn’t be. And remember, I think I’m talking down to you, too. [pause] But, you know, we’re not! [laughs bleakly] You know me. We’re all – we’re all alike, here, us four. But we just don’t sort of get to talk it out with each other.</p>\n<h2 id=\"18\">1/8</h2>\n<h3 id=\"freer-queer\">‘Freer’, ‘queer’.</h3>\n<p>January 8th, 1969: George introduces ‘I, Me, Mine’ and plays it for Paul for the first time. Paul and Let It Be director Michael Lindsay-Hogg inform him on his phrasing.</p>\n<p>GEORGE: Uh, is that grammatic? “Flowing more freely than wine.”</p>\n<p>MICHAEL: Yeah.</p>\n<p>GEORGE: “Flowing much ‘freer’”? [pause] “Freer”?</p>\n<p>MICHAEL: “Flowing more ‘freely’.”</p>\n<p>PAUL: “Freely.” “Freer.”</p>\n<p>GEORGE: It’s funny in writing, yeah – thinking of how you say it—</p>\n<p>PAUL: “Freer.” For it’s sticky out here. [general laughter]</p>\n<p>GEORGE: But I was thinking, “freer” – if there was a such a word as “freer”, is it f-r-e-e-e-r—</p>\n<p>MICHAEL: No, it’s f-r-e-e-r, it’s f-r-e-e-r.</p>\n<p>GEORGE: “Free—”</p>\n<p>PAUL: Like “queer”, “freer”. [laughs] “Freer”, “queer”.</p>\n<h3 id=\"two-of-us-wearing-postcards\">Two of us wearing postcards…</h3>\n<p>January 8th, 1969: John and Paul sing a rollicking version of ‘Two Of Us’ in the style of Elvis Presley. (An edited segment of this performance was later included and featured in the documentary-film Let It Be.)</p>\n<h3 id=\"i-know-that-i-cant-win-but-then--what-can-i-do--you-win-again\">I know that I can’t win but then / What can I do / You win again…</h3>\n<p>January 8th, 1969 (Twickenham Film Studios, London): John (with George accompanying on vocals) sings a strain of Hank Williams’ ‘You Win Again’.</p>\n<p>JOHN: The news is out all over town / That you’ve been seen out and around / I know that I can’t win but then / What can I do / You win again…</p>\n<h3 id=\"it-sounds-so-hard-to-do-i-mean-for-you\">It sounds so hard to do. I mean, for you.</h3>\n<p>January 8th, 1969: George plays ‘I Me Mine’ to John for the first time. John snacks on food, opens Paul’s mail, and doesn’t pay much attention.</p>\n<p>JOHN: Is that the end of it?</p>\n<p>GEORGE: Yeah. It’s only that long—</p>\n<p>JOHN: We can use it for a commercial. [laughs; bored] So uh, yeah. It’s fine. And what do we do about that?</p>\n<p>GEORGE: Um, well, it’s just a bit – you see—</p>\n<p>JOHN: It sounds so hard to do.</p>\n<p>GEORGE: No, it’s… no.</p>\n<p>JOHN: I mean, for you.</p>\n<p>GEORGE: No.</p>\n<p>JOHN: [falsetto] I me mine… You know, all that singing.</p>\n<p>GEORGE: [starts playing again] All through the day, I me mine, I me mine, I me mine… All through the night, I me\r\nmine, I me mine, I me mine… No one’s frightened of leaving it, everyone’s weaving it, coming on strong all the time…</p>\n<p>JOHN: [operatic] I me my me my me my me my oh…</p>\n<p>GEORGE: All I can hear… [starts playing forcefully] I me mine – I me mine – I me mine…</p>\n<p>JOHN: All the girls can come on and dance it. Hari [Krishna]s and fisherwives, and dwarves, and hunchbacks…</p>\n<p>GEORGE: Even your tears, I me mine, I me mine, I me mine… No one’s frightened of playing it, everyone’s saying it, flowing more freely than wine…</p>\n<p>JOHN: [derisive] Run along, son. [laughs] See you later. We’re a rock ‘n’ roll band, you know. Bom bo bom bo bom bo bom bo bom…</p>\n<h3 id=\"when-im-up-against-the-wall-paul-youll-find-im-on-my-best\">When I’m up against the wall, Paul, you’ll find I’m on my best—</h3>\n<p>January 8th, 1969: After John dismisses all of the songs he’s come up with for the Get Back/Let It Be sessions, Paul asks John if he has written anything new to make up for it. He hasn’t. No one is thrilled about this.</p>\n<p>PAUL: Haven’t you written anything?</p>\n<p>JOHN: [defiant] No.</p>\n<p>PAUL: [tense] Haven’t you. [pause] We’ll be faced with a crisis, you know.</p>\n<p>JOHN: When I’m up against the wall, Paul, you’ll find I’m on my best—</p>\n<p>PAUL: Yeah, I know, I know, but I just wish you’d come up with the goods.</p>\n<p>JOHN: Now, look. I think I’ve got Sunday off.</p>\n<p>PAUL: Yeah, well, I hope that you can deliver.</p>\n<p>JOHN: I’m hoping for a little rock ‘n’ roller.</p>\n<p>PAUL: [sarcastic] Yeah, I was hoping for the same thing, myself, you know.</p>\n<p>JOHN: [mocking] “Sammy loved his mammy, she hammy dammy dammy…”</p>\n<h3 id=\"i-remember-that-on-my-sickbed-in-bournemouth\">I remember that on my sickbed in Bournemouth.</h3>\n<p>January 8th, 1969 (Twickenham Film Studios, London): George recalls the writing of ‘Don’t Bother Me’, the other Beatles’ high-chasing imbibing of George’s cough medicine, and a recent (re)encounter with poet Royston Ellis.</p>\n<p>GEORGE: [laughs] I remember that on my sickbed in Bournemouth. In fact, that’s what it was. You know I was in bed in Bournemouth, where we were on a summer season [laughs], and the doctor gave me some – some tonic, which had some amphetamine or something in it. Remember? And you all, like, drank it to get high. Just [inaudible] got you high. [inaudible] And that’s when I wrote that one.</p>\n<h3 id=\"i-dont-think-youre-dancing-right-john\">I don’t think you’re dancing right, John.</h3>\n<p>January 8th, 1969 (Twickenham Film Studios, London): George leads a preliminary run-through of ‘I Me Mine’ and advises John and Yoko on their footwork. (Note: John and Yoko’s waltzing is featured in the Let It Be film documentary. George’s dance tips may or may not be passive-aggressive.)</p>\n<p>GEORGE: I don’t think you’re dancing right, John.</p>\n<h3 id=\"you-stole-into-my-heart-like-a-creeping-nun-my-arteries-were-overwhelmed\">You stole into my heart like a creeping nun… My arteries were overwhelmed.</h3>\n<p>January 8th, 1969 (Twickenham Film Studios, London): An uneasy Michael Lindsay-Hogg tries to steer the band (or just Paul) back into discussing the logistics of their imminent televised concert and/or television documentary. Paul sings a strain of Carl Perkin’s ‘Your True Love’, and John improvises his own love song.</p>\n<p>JOHN: You stole into my heart like a creeping nun… My arteries were overwhelmed.</p>\n<p>MICHAEL: That would be pretty good like as a melody.</p>\n<p>JOHN: A malady?</p>\n<h2 id=\"19\">1/9</h2>\n<h3 id=\"all-the-pleasure-from-the-many-ways-ive-tried\">All the pleasure from the many ways I’ve tried</h3>\n<p>January 9th, 1969 (Twickenham Film Studios, London): With John and George yet to arrive at the studio, Mal and Ringo sit with Paul at the piano as Paul tries to figure out the lyrics for the middle-eight of ‘The Long And Winding Road’.</p>\n<p>PAUL: All the pleasure from the many ways I’ve tried / But still they… “I’ve had lots of pleasure but said better,” you know. “I’ve had many pleasure, I’ve had much much more pleasure…” The many times I’ve been alone / The many times I’ve cried…</p>\n<p>…</p>\n<p>MAL: Put “waiting here” and “standing there.”</p>\n<p>PAUL: Yeah, I was thinking of that.</p>\n<h3 id=\"a-verse-about-getting-drunk-and-a-weight-upon-my-head\">A verse about getting drunk and a weight upon my head</h3>\n<p>January 9th, 1969 (Twickenham Film Studios, London): With John and George yet to arrive at the studio, Ringo sits with Paul at the piano as they chat about the origins of ‘Golden Slumbers’ and the originally intended music hall leanings of ‘Carry That Weight’.</p>\n<p>PAUL: That really should be like a fairy tale. “Once upon a time there lived a princess and…” Once upon a time / There lived a king / “Sleep pretty darling do not cry / And I will sing a lullaby.”</p>\n<p>MAL: [laughs] And the king will sing a lullaby.</p>\n<p>…</p>\n<p>PAUL AND RINGO: And this is why she said… She said, “Boy, you’re gonna carry that weight, carry that weight a long time…”</p>\n<p>PAUL: Like their troubles, all their troubles. But it was like a comedy when I heard it, you know. [starts playing jaunty piano] Boy, you’re gonna carry that weight / Carry that weight a long time…</p>\n<p>…</p>\n<p>PAUL: See, I think there might a verse about, I got drunk, I got in trouble with the wife, got drunk, so on and so on and so on, and it all goes to the next morning with a weight upon my head, and I found out it was my head. [laughs; starts playing jaunty piano] Boy, you’re gonna carry that weight / Carry that weight a long time… Just sort of normal kind of troubles that everyone has, and then just boy, you’re gonna…</p>\n<p>…</p>\n<p>PAUL: But it could be one of those things where, you know like in those songs where you’ve got everything, and everything’s going so great, but like, “This morning, one of my eggs broke,” you know. [laughs]</p>\n<p>RINGO: [laughs; plays piano] “The rabbit’s got away.”</p>\n<p>PAUL: [laughs] Just something trivial.</p>\n<p>MAL: “Broke a mirror.”</p>\n<p>PAUL: “My right shoe’s a bit tight.” Boy, you’re gonna carry that weight…</p>\n<h3 id=\"hows-it-going-to-end\">How’s it going to end?</h3>\n<p>January 9th, 1969 (Twickenham Film Studios, London): As everyone waits for John and George to arrive, Ringo, Mal, and director Michael-Lindsay Hogg listen as Paul tries to figure out the lyrics for the second verse of ‘The Long And Winding Road’. (Note: Mal’s reference to The Wizard of Oz reminds me of this interview he did in 1975 about him and Paul crying over John’s “I want a divorce” declarative.)</p>\n<p>PAUL: See I was thinking of having another – like the weather obstacle.</p>\n<p>MICHAEL: It’s beautiful. What’s it called?</p>\n<p>PAUL: ‘The Long And Winding Road’. [tries playing; falters] The only trouble is I always think of the… The storm clouds and the rain / Break up over the winding road… [trails off]</p>\n<p>…</p>\n<p>PAUL: I suppose it should still be about this sort of winding road. I’ve just got that picture – just the winding road that leads to your door, it will never disappear, I’ve seen that road before, it’ll always lead me here, lead me to your door. [audio feedback] Oh no!</p>\n<p>RINGO: [laughs] It’s a start.</p>\n<p>MAL: What you’re talking is sort of like The Wizard of Oz. Did you ever see The Wizard of Oz?</p>\n<p>PAUL: No no no, I didn’t, but I’ve—</p>\n<p>MAL: ‘The Yellow Brick Road’?</p>\n<p>PAUL: Yeah. I know.</p>\n<p>MAL: ‘The Long And Winding Road’.</p>\n<p>MICHAEL: It’s great.</p>\n<p>PAUL: You see, it’s also something… [starts playing again]</p>\n<p>MAL: It’s got that feel about it, you know? [inaudible] —so [Dorothy] gets back to, back to the boys— [inaudible] —and she’s never going to see them again.</p>\n<p>MICHAEL: Yeah, yeah, exactly.</p>\n<p>MAL: It’s a terrible feeling.</p>\n<p>MICHAEL: Heartbreaker, yeah. It’s great.</p>\n<p>MAL: It made me cry.</p>\n<p>…</p>\n<p>PAUL: It could be like the thing that’s up ahead. The thing that’s up ahead / At the end of the road…</p>\n<p>MAL: Like, how about like the obstacles on the road, that you’re going over?</p>\n<p>PAUL: No, but I think the obstacles – eh, you know. I have enough obstacles without putting them in the song. [laughs]</p>\n<p>MICHAEL: How’s it going to end? Is it going to end happily, or just – not sure yet? Is that the end?</p>\n<p>PAUL: No, it should end something like this. But still they lead me back / To the long and winding road / You left me waiting here / A long long time ago / Don’t leave me standing here / Lead me to your door…</p>\n<h2 id=\"110\">1/10</h2>\n<h3 id=\"i-think-ill-be-leaving-the-band-now\">I think I’ll be leaving the band now</h3>\n<p>January 10th, 1969: Following an (unrecorded) argument with John in the Twickenham Film Studios lunch room, George returns to the studio floor and decides to leave The Beatles. (George then drives out of London, goes home to Liverpool, and writes ‘Wah Wah’.)</p>\n<p>GEORGE: —I think I’ll be leaving the band now.</p>\n<p>JOHN: When?</p>\n<p>GEORGE: Now. [audio cuts off]</p>\n<h3 id=\"because-theyre-a-songwriting-team\">Because they’re a songwriting team</h3>\n<p>January 10th, 1969: George has just left the studios after deciding to quit The Beatles;  George Martin, Neil Aspinall, and Let It Be director Michael Lindsay-Hogg discuss why. In the meantime, John, Paul, and Ringo jam through a dramatic, shrieking rendition of ‘It’s Only Make Believe’. (If you’re wondering: they’re a little drunk.)</p>\n<p>MICHAEL: The trouble is, once you leave, it’s very hard to come back.</p>\n<p>NEIL: Not really. We’ll all have to meet him on Sunday, anyway. So he could be back, then. No, really, the box that George is in is, um – it’s him versus John and Paul when it comes to what he’s got to do and what he has to play.</p>\n<p>GEORGE M.: And there’s the songwriting. Because they’re a songwriting team, and he’s – he’s his own team. And [inaudible] it’s tough.</p>\n<p>MICHAEL: Yes, but – John and Paul aren’t writing together much anymore, are they, really?</p>\n<p>GEORGE M.: No, but nevertheless, they’re still a team.</p>\n<h3 id=\"eggs-thrown-at-us-in-australia\">Eggs thrown at us in Australia</h3>\n<p>January 10th, 1969 (Twickenham Film Studios, London): While Paul wordlessly plays Samuel Barber’s ‘Adagio For Strings’ in the background,  director Michael Lindsay-Hogg, producer Glyn Johns, and Mal Evans chat about incidents on tour with the Beatles and the Stones, prompting John and Ringo to share their own memories of touring during the onset of Beatlemania.</p>\n<p>JOHN: [American accent] Oh yes. Why, I think of it every day. I think what fun we had, when we was The Beatles, playing and rocking, with the group around the world. I said, “Richard, you remember that?” And he says, “No, I hadn’t joined you then.” [laughter]</p>\n<p>RINGO: The hotels, I have very fond memories of.</p>\n<p>JOHN: [laughs] Yeah.</p>\n<p>RINGO: The tour, I’m not so fond of.</p>\n<p>JOHN: Having eggs thrown at us in Australia was one of my big moments.</p>\n<p>RINGO: I was away for a long time with tonsilitis. [laughs]</p>\n<p>JOHN: Ah, yes.</p>\n<p>MICHAEL: Who went out instead?</p>\n<p>RINGO: Bobby Nicol, Jimmie Nicol?</p>\n<p>MICHAEL: Jimmie Nicol?</p>\n<p>JOHN: Jimmie Nicol, who is now making a living as the twenty-ninth Beatle in New Mexico. [Michael laughs]</p>\n<h3 id=\"mersey-beat-couple-of-the-year\">Mersey Beat Couple of the Year</h3>\n<p>January 10th, 1969 (Twickenham FIlm Studios, London): After George’s walk-out of the studios (and the band), Paul, Ringo, Maureen, Mal Evans, Neil Aspinall, George Martin, and Michael Lindsay-Hogg sit around telling each other knock-knock jokes and facetiously discussing the band’s forthcoming live concert/television special plans. John and Yoko (who have been in another room doing an interview) return to the studio when the group is reading the day’s spread of newspapers.</p>\n<p>GEORGE M.: Oh I do like to be beside the seaside…</p>\n<p>MICHAEL: So at the moment, how’s America looking? Where’s, uh—</p>\n<p>RINGO: America doesn’t… it isn’t nice at all.</p>\n<p>MICHAEL: Doesn’t look nice at all. [pause] Where’s he gone?</p>\n<p>GEORGE M.: John?</p>\n<p>MICHAEL: Four-eyes.</p>\n<p>RINGO: He’s most probably off painting somewhere.</p>\n<p>PAUL: [snorts] Yeah, yeah. Sketching.</p>\n<p>MICHAEL: Sketching, or writing a quick poem. Or a book. Or a diary.</p>\n<p>PAUL: Probably in a bag in his dressing room with Yoko, you know. [general laughter] They brought their own bag with ‘em today.</p>\n<p>MICHAEL: Hence the expression…</p>\n<p>GEORGE M.: “Papa’s got a—“</p>\n<p>MICHAEL &#x26; GEORGE M.: “—brand new bag.”</p>\n<p>GEORGE M.: Snap.</p>\n<p>MICHAEL: Snap. [laughs] “Papa’s got a brand new bag-snap.” Or a zip. So, uh… [long pause] The seven men are going out to Africa on Monday, right? [uproarious laughter] We’ve got a reconnaissance team.</p>\n<p>PAUL: Seven Zulus going to Willesden on Monday. [laughter] To check it out.</p>\n<p>MICHAEL: No, we keep adding all the time.</p>\n<p>PAUL: Or Paddington Town Hall.</p>\n<p>RINGO: A special hired jet Boeing 707 is taking a full haul to Constaninopole. To see what the weather’s like.</p>\n<p>MICHAEL: [laughs] And the show will be done in Ethiopia.</p>\n<p>RINGO: That’s a nice place. Did someone say that before?</p>\n<p>MICHAEL: Ethiopia? Oh, that’s my joke! Do you remember my joke of Haile Selassie?</p>\n<p>GEORGE M.: The Abyssinian?</p>\n<p>RINGO: Isn’t he Brazilian?</p>\n<p>MICHAEL: No, no – the punchline is “Haile Selassie”.</p>\n<p>RINGO: Then what’s the bit before?</p>\n<p>MICHAEL: And the bit before is, “Do you want to buy my tomatoes?” Do you want to buy my – it’s a queer Moroccan joke which I made up.</p>\n<p>RINGO: “Do you want to buy my tomatoes?” “Haile Selassie.” [laughs]</p>\n<p>PAUL: Very good joke.</p>\n<p>GEORGE M.: Did you tell it to anyone here? Have we heard it yet?</p>\n<p>MICHAEL: Well, some of them heard it on the first day, and rejected it. “Haile Selassie.” See, I thought it was a kind of nice rough trade, New York joke. “Haile Selassie.” But it goes through a list of things you would sell for money. [laughter] I find this very funny! I—</p>\n<p>RINGO: Do you want to buy my potatoes?</p>\n<p>MICHAEL: No.</p>\n<p>RINGO: Princess Margaret. [Michael laughs]</p>\n<p>PAUL: [inaudible]</p>\n<p>RINGO: Knock knock.</p>\n<p>MICHAEL: Who’s there?</p>\n<p>RINGO: Charlie.</p>\n<p>MICHAEL: Charlie who?</p>\n<p>RINGO: Elizabeth Harden. [long pause; general laughter]</p>\n<p>MICHAEL: I love knock-knocks. We were going to do one for the [Rock ‘n’ Roll] Circus, we were gonna have “Knock knock, who’s there?” and someone was gonna say, “That’s right.” And then, “What do you mean, ‘That’s right?’”</p>\n<p>RINGO: [in background; to Maureen] I stole it from you, my dear, I know that. [Maureen laughs]</p>\n<p>PAUL: [laughs] I don’t get it!</p>\n<p>RINGO: What?</p>\n<p>PAUL: “Charlie Elizabeth Harden”? [general laughter]</p>\n<p>MICHAEL: The “who”, the “who” is there.</p>\n<p>MAL: [laughs] That’s what you do!</p>\n<p>RINGO: “Michael.” “Michael who?” “Bill and Ben.” [general laughter]</p>\n<p>MICHAEL: I love knock-knocks.</p>\n<p>GEORGE M.: I like the song ones.</p>\n<p>MICHAEL: Who’s there?</p>\n<p>GEORGE M.: Knock knock.</p>\n<p>RINGO: Arthur. Is that?</p>\n<p>MICHAEL: Is that who?</p>\n<p>RINGO: Is that your Cornetto? [Michael laughs]</p>\n<p>MICHAEL: Hiawatha.</p>\n<p>RINGO: Hiawatha who?</p>\n<p>MICHAEL: Hiawatha good little boy till I met you.</p>\n<p>GEORGE M.: Knock knock.</p>\n<p>MICHAEL: Who’s there?</p>\n<p>GEORGE M.: It is Simon.</p>\n<p>MICHAEL: Simon who?</p>\n<p>GEORGE M.: Simon chanting evening… [general laughter]</p>\n<p>PAUL: [to John and Yoko?; Cockney accent] Get in your bag! Get in here boy and get in your bloody bag! Go on! [long pause; rustling; thick Northern accent] The Mersey Beat Awards for Couple of the Year goes to John and Yoko. [long pause] Irritant of the Year. [pause; nervous laughter]</p>\n<p>MAL: Is he the Irritant of the Year?</p>\n<p>RINGO: No.</p>\n<p>PAUL: Private Eye.

Bernard Levin.</p>\n<p>RINGO: Bernard, that’s the one. I don’t want to say his name in case he sees me. [reading] “Yes, we’ve done it again!” says the Daily Mirror.</p>\n<p>PAUL: “Yes, they’ve done it again!” says the Daily Mail.</p>\n<p>RINGO: “Yes, we’ve—” [inaudible]</p>\n<p>PAUL: “Well, we’ve missed it again!” says the daily work.

With saffron.</p>\n<h3 id=\"do-we-want-to-carry-on-the-beatles\">Do we want to carry on The Beatles?</h3>\n<p>January 10th, 1969 (Twickenham Film Studios, London): In the aftermath of George’s walk-out of the studio and the band earlier in the day, John talks (sincerely or not) to Michael Lindsay-Hogg about letting The Beatles continue on as a group by simply replacing George with Eric Clapton, while Michael also talks idly with George Martin and the others about his chewing tobacco. In the background, Paul (who has been cushioning himself with a piano for the past hour, not speaking to anyone) plays ‘Martha My Dear’ on end, Yoko calls John’s name into her microphone in a similarly endless refrain, and the two seem to coalesce into an unusual jam.</p>\n<p>MICHAEL: I’ll check. [pause] Glyn! Glyn. Yoko wants a mic.</p>\n<p>JOHN: I think, uh, if George doesn’t come back by Monday or Tuesday, we ask Eric Clapton to play in it.</p>\n<p>MAL: [inaudible]</p>\n<p>JOHN: I mean, if George is leaving the group—</p>\n<p>RINGO: [inaudible] —then why did he leave the Creem group?</p>\n<p>JOHN: But no, Eric would be pleased if George— He left Creem because they’re all—</p>\n<p>RINGO: All soloists.</p>\n<p>JOHN: —all soloists. Were it not [inaudible] he’d have full scope to play his guitar. The point is, if George leaves, do we want to carry on The Beatles? I do. [inaudible; drowned out by mic feedback] And I’d just get another member of the group and carry on. But if The Beatles split, well, I’ll get another group. [to Paul and Yoko?] I’m a singer not a dancer, baby! Woo-hoo!</p>\n<p>MAL:</p>\n<p>Personally— [inaudible] —do you really want to do it over here?</p>\n<p>RINGO: I don’t particularly want to do it with another Beatle, but I will.</p>\n<p>JOHN: Well hello there, Michael Lindsay Hogg.</p>\n<p>MICHAEL: We have a lot of shots of the empty seat, we can lay the dialogue over it like in two movie times.</p>\n<p>JOHN: We are?</p>\n<p>MICHAEL: [laughs] Maybe we’re not going to get very much. [long pause] You see, maybe for the show, you could just say George was sick.</p>\n<p>JOHN: No – I mean if he leaves, he leaves.</p>\n<p>YOKO: [in background] John… John… John…</p>\n<p>MICHAEL: But what’s the consensus? Do you want to go on with the show and the work?</p>\n<p>JOHN: Yeah. If he doesn’t come back by Tuesday, we’ll get Clapton in.</p>\n<p>YOKO: John… John… John…</p>\n<p>JOHN: What!</p>\n<p>YOKO: John!</p>\n<p>JOHN: [screaming] What!</p>\n<p>YOKO: John… John… John…</p>\n<p>JOHN: Yoko! Anything you say, dear! I brought the tea!</p>\n<p>YOKO: [screaming] John! John! John!</p>\n<p>JOHN: [screaming] Yes!</p>\n<p>YOKO: John?</p>\n<p>JOHN: Yoko.</p>\n<p>YOKO: John…</p>\n<p>JOHN: Yoko!</p>\n<p>YOKO: John…</p>\n<p>JOHN: Yoko!</p>\n<p>YOKO: John…</p>\n<p>JOHN: Stop that.</p>\n<p>YOKO: John… John…</p>\n<p>MICHAEL: We could get Ike or Tina Turner over.</p>\n<p>JOHN: Instead of George?</p>\n<p>MICHAEL: Yeah.</p>\n<p>YOKO: John… John… John…</p>\n<p>RINGO: I’m afraid he’s not in!</p>\n<p>YOKO: John! John! John!</p>\n<p>JOHN: He’s busy!</p>\n<p>YOKO: [screaming] John… John… John…</p>\n<p>JOHN: Yes?</p>\n<p>MICHAEL: What do the other lads feel?</p>\n<p>MAL: Broken. ‘Cause we want to feel what the lads feel.</p>\n<p>MICHAEL: About – just going on?</p>\n<p>MAL: Essentially.</p>\n<p>MICHAEL: Do it.</p>\n<p>YOKO: [screaming] John! John! John!</p>\n<p>JOHN: Bloody mad.</p>\n<p>MICHAEL: And then what about the venues, as they say in the rock ’n’ roll— [audio mutes] —it’s a funny thing to say, but if it’s… I don’t know, I was going to say if – if it is – if George comes back we go away, and if Eric comes in we stay here. But I think if – I think we should go away.</p>\n<p>JOHN: I think we should just go on, though.</p>\n<p>MICHAEL: I think we should go away.</p>\n<p>JOHN: As if nothing’s happening.</p>\n<p>MICHAEL: Yeah. I think we should go away.</p>\n<p>YOKO: John… John… John…</p>\n<h2 id=\"113\">1/13</h2>\n<h3 id=\"morning-starting-from-scratch-with-yoko-there\">(Morning) Starting from scratch with Yoko there</h3>\n<p>January 13th, 1969: After George’s departure from the band on the 10th (Friday), Paul, Linda, Ringo, and Neil Aspinall start their morning in the studio discussing a band meeting held at Ringo’s house over the weekend, where John’s willful deference to Yoko drove George to walk out of the room, leaving matters amongst the group unresolved. Neil reassures Paul and Ringo that George still cares about the band, and only wants to settle everything equally and honestly amongst the four of them, without any outsiders.</p>\n<p>Amidst everyone’s comments about Yoko’s over-involvement (ergo John’s recalcitrance), Paul admits that the protective seal the band formed around themselves over the years has made it difficult for them to regard anyone unfamiliar into their faction without some measure of hostility and paranoia - especially if they have been asserted into a creative and professional position equal to their own, as Yoko has by John.</p>\n<p>PAUL: Waiting for you, ooh… Why don’t you know… what it could be…</p>\n<p>LINDA: It’s a good thing if all four of you just got together – and nobody else. You know, it’s alright when we’re all just sitting around now.</p>\n<p>RINGO: Did you go last night, Neil?</p>\n<p>NEIL: Um – this is, um, just something I was talking to George about last night. And that was what he was saying, too.</p>\n<p>RINGO: What?</p>\n<p>NEIL: What he means. [About] just the four of you.</p>\n<p>LINDA: Yeah, it’s—</p>\n<p>NEIL: That’s what he means, you know. Nothing else.</p>\n<p>RINGO: Yes.</p>\n<p>PAUL: Yeah, I’m for that, you know.</p>\n<p>NEIL: So am I.</p>\n<p>RINGO: Yes.</p>\n<p>LINDA: It’s the only way you’re gonna—</p>\n<p>NEIL: That’s why he didn’t – that’s why he said, “I don’t believe you,” to John. Yesterday.</p>\n<p>PAUL: Yeah… Key moment, that, wasn’t it?</p>\n<p>NEIL: [wry] Yes. But he meant it. And I think John knew what he was talking about, too.</p>\n<p>PAUL: Oh, John. [laughter] Sure he did.</p>\n<p>NEIL: And that’s why George said it twice. When John said, “I don’t understand you, George,” and George said, “I don’t believe you. Forget it.” ‘Cause he thought [John] did understand him.</p>\n<p>PAUL: [unsurprised] Of course he did.</p>\n<p>LINDA: [wry] It was great.</p>\n<p>NEIL: You know, and it’s that. It’s like the bullshitting bit where, like, that can go on, is silly.</p>\n<p>PAUL: Yeah. But I think the thing is, like, we – John does bullshit, I bullshit, Ringo bullshits, George bullshits. You know, we bullshit. The problem is that it’s only John— [inaudible; Michael Lindsay-Hogg’s voice recording a phone call] —trying to be more influencing, and they’re thinking past it. And so you start to sort of give him more credit than he’s – than he’s due for, you know. And, like, with Yoko, you know – they’re real. They mean it.</p>\n<p>LINDA: [laughs] I don’t dig that, though.</p>\n<p>PAUL: Him and Yoko, you know, they – they—</p>\n<p>LINDA: [pretends to sneeze] Go away!</p>\n<p>PAUL: You know, they do mean it. But…</p>\n<p>NEIL: [playing along] Everybody cough. Heeueck.</p>\n<p>LINDA: [playing along] Heuuuueck go away. Heeueck.</p>\n<p>PAUL: [sober] You know?</p>\n<p>LINDA: [sincere] Yeah, I know what you mean. You know what you mean.</p>\n<p>PAUL: But you know, I – I tend to think that about them, too. Like I was saying, you know. “Well, I’d rather write without Yoko, thank you.” Just because it’s – that’s the way I write. If I – like, if I was in Tunisia, I’d go up to the bathroom to write a song, and then come back when it was done to show it to you. And to sort of say, “Let’s do a couple more words, now that’s it all there, you know, now that there’s only a little…”</p>\n<p>NEIL: Yeah.</p>\n<p>PAUL: But it’s difficult starting right from scratch with Yoko there, ‘cause you start off on a – well, I do. I start off on a Yoko beam, you know. I start off sort of writing songs about white walls. [laughter] Just ‘cause I – you know, just ‘cause I think she – John and Yoko would like that. And they wouldn’t, you know. I mean, I give them too much credit for – for what I think they’d like. But that’s not true. They wouldn’t. They’re very straight. […] I mean, you know, it’s just like—</p>\n<p>LINDA: It’s all about being away from each other, aren’t they?</p>\n<p>PAUL: I think it’s—</p>\n<p>NEIL: No, I don’t – I don’t think it’s that.</p>\n<p>RINGO: Did you get in touch with John?</p>\n<p>NEIL: Um, Mal did. This morning, in fact.</p>\n<p>LINDA: That was the answering service.</p>\n<p>RINGO: [to Neil] Oh, you guys – I thought you were, later on. [Ringo thought Neil contacted John after the band meeting, the previous night.]</p>\n<p>NEIL: I couldn’t get him.</p>\n<p>RINGO: No?</p>\n<p>MICHAEL: Is he join – is he joining us?</p>\n<p>RINGO: We don’t know.</p>\n<p>NEIL: I suppose [John and Yoko] might, but nobody can expect as much.</p>\n<p>RINGO: ‘Cause Mal couldn’t get him either, you know. He may be up now.</p>\n<p>NEIL: So – nobody’s spoken to him?</p>\n<p>RINGO: No no no. You can only get the machine. So someone should try again.</p>\n<p>NEIL: [inaudible] But nobody’s answering it.</p>\n<p>LINDA: [to Paul] Yeah, but it’s hard having a meeting, and everybody putting their two cents in and none of you all saying – anything.</p>\n<p>PAUL: But that’s the other thing, having the meeting, you know. You came with me, and Heather came, and the animal—</p>\n<p>LINDA: Yeah, I was going to say I shouldn’t go, but then…</p>\n<p>PAUL: Yeah… [lighthearted] It’s such a temptation going out to Ringo’s for the afternoon.</p>\n<p>LINDA: [laughs] Exactly.</p>\n<p>RINGO: [bemused] What?</p>\n<p>LINDA: Heather could play with Zak.</p>\n<p>PAUL: It feels like a family outing. [Ringo laughs] Don’t really just want to go on my own.</p>\n<p>LINDA: [sheepish] Yeah, I was going to say, “We really shouldn’t go,” but then I thought – well.</p>\n<p>RINGO: Why?</p>\n<p>LINDA: Well, it should’ve been—</p>\n<p>PAUL: Well, it should have been the four of us, you know.</p>\n<p>RINGO: Oh— [to Linda; reasonable] Well, you were out of the way.</p>\n<p>PAUL: Oh, yeah, sure.</p>\n<p>LINDA: Sure.</p>\n<p>RINGO: I mean— [inaudible]</p>\n<p>LINDA: Oh yeah, but you know, it’s just like…</p>\n<p>PAUL: It’s – it’s still, it’s that thing, you know.</p>\n<p>RINGO: Mm.</p>\n<p>LINDA: When there’s something serious, and you have other people there talking about it, you get off the track.</p>\n<p>PAUL: You know, it really is – it really is like a board meeting going on.</p>\n<p>RINGO: [mock-stern; to Linda] If you would’ve just kept quiet, it could’ve all gone well.</p>\n<p>LINDA: [playing along] Well, I had to talk every two minutes. [laughs]</p>\n<p>PAUL: Ol’ Sir Joberry and his wife…</p>\n<p>RINGO: [playing along] Damn Yankee. [laughter]</p>\n<p>PAUL: You know, but that’s it. It’s like that. The board meeting with ICLI, and all the government bringing all the wives, [laughs] and mates, and kids, and animals – and everything.</p>\n<p>NEIL: But it turns – it turns into— [inaudible]</p>\n<p>LINDA: Well, Yoko is doing all the talking.</p>\n<p>NEIL: But that’s – that’s the point, you see. You know that he’s going to, and you know that Yoko’s going to be sitting there, and so everybody else is like, “Fuck it.” You know it’s not going to be a [proper] board meeting, so…</p>\n<p>PAUL: Yeah, right.</p>\n<p>NEIL: “Let’s make it a party.”</p>\n<p>PAUL: Sure, that’s – that, really, that—</p>\n<p>LINDA: But she does so much talking for [John], now.</p>\n<p>PAUL: But see, now, so what do you do about that? That’s what I was saying about songs, yesterday, you know. I’m – I know that if – to write any more with John, I’ve just gotta, like, figh– [faltering] you know, forget it.</p>\n<p>LINDA: But I think that whole—</p>\n<p>PAUL: See I think it’s – it’s us, uptight about that. I really do – I think, uh…</p>\n<p>LINDA: The king.</p>\n<p>PAUL: See, it’s like – the trouble with us – like, John said it yesterday – it’s like, anything that comes up on all of our little egos, we try and push out. And anybody – it’s always been that. Anybody who’s come in, like Michael Braun – who was writing that book – came in for a while, within the circle for a while, but then he gets pushed out. ‘Cause, you know, we don’t want him in the inner circle. He’s got to stay on the edges, while the four of us get on with – you know.</p>\n<p>(Note: As suggested above, John and Yoko are late to the studio - which is not uncommon, as far as the entire sessions are concerned, but this time no one is even sure they’re going to show up, especially when George isn’t here, and rehearsals aren’t likely to progress. It is later discovered that they had disconnected their phone lines; when they finally get through, after more than a hour, it’s only because John calls the studio first. It may or may not be significant that John calls specifically to speak to Paul - and after speaking with him, decides to come to the studio after all.</p>\n<p>It is the popular opinion - and indeed, the members themselves have claimed the same - that George initially quit the band following a tense exchange with Paul. Definitively, however, George actually quit following an unrecorded argument with John; that oft-discussed scene between George and Paul from the Let It Be documentary happened four days before the fact. Which isn’t to say that Paul is any less responsible for George’s emotional state than John is; there had already been years of interpersonal band dynamics before Yoko ever got into the picture. That John was determined not to speak for himself, and considered Yoko’s opinion above George’s in matters related to the band, was probably a tipping point.</p>\n<p>Yoko speaking on behalf of John has the further implication of passive-aggressive inaction on John’s part - at this time, he didn’t want to be actively involved in the band anymore; he didn’t want to forfeit his symbolic position as a “leader” of having the final say, but he didn’t want to be the bad guy and call it off, either. Hence the entitled deference and exchangeability and establishment of symbiosis, to oust the old out with the new - until the boat called Paul sank, and he could set sail on the boat called Yoko.)</p>\n<h3 id=\"she-was-talking-for-john\">She was talking for John</h3>\n<p>January 13th, 1969 (Twickenham Film Studios, London): During a morning discussion of John and Yoko’s conduct and its unnerving impact on the Beatles, Linda offers her observation of what was (and wasn’t) communicated by John and Yoko during a tense band meeting held the previous night. (Note: Follows shortly after this audio clip. Re: the band meeting, I would recommend listening to that as well as this other audio clip for more context.)</p>\n<p>LINDA: ’Cause I have a feeling that half the stuff Yoko said yesterday isn’t – I mean, she was talking for John, and I don’t think he really believed any of that, you know.</p>\n<h3 id=\"two-answers-fight-her-or-accept-shes-there\">Two answers: fight her, or accept she’s there</h3>\n<p>January 13th, 1969: As everyone waits for John and Yoko to arrive at the studio, Paul talks about John’s uncommunicativeness, and how he uses it as a defense to avoid speaking honestly or decisively about his own feelings. While Paul is convinced that Yoko provides something for John that The Beatles (read: Paul) can’t anymore, and hedgingly defends the couple to do what they will, the others suggest John doesn’t really want to sever his partnership with Paul, either.</p>\n<p>NEIL: I’d just rather not say anything. It’s one of those situations.</p>\n<p>PAUL: Yeah. [pause] Well, that’s – that’s the trouble you see, there, ‘cause that’s it. It’s like, with our – heightened awareness, the answer is not to say anything, you know. But it isn’t. ‘Cause I mean, we screw each other up totally if we don’t do that. ‘Cause we’re not ready for your heightened… vows of silence. [laughs; hapless] We’re really not! Like, we don’t know what the fuck each other’s talking about, when that – we all just sort of get—</p>\n<p>NEIL: I think it’s just between the four of you, that get it. That’s what I’d pretend.</p>\n<p>PAUL: Oh yeah, right, yeah. But you see, that’s it, that’s why John doesn’t say anything. ‘Cause he, you know, he just… There was something the other day, when I said, “Well, what do you think?” And he just stood there and didn’t say anything. And then – and I know exactly why, you know. I mean, I wouldn’t, if… [long pause] Somehow. You know, there’s nothing really much to be said about it. You just – we all just have to do it, and all that, instead of like talking about it. But – but if one of us is talking about it, it’s a drag if the other three aren’t. Because then it sort of throws you off. [inaudible; voice marking tape slate] I mean, we’ve just been talking about it now for a few years, you know. Like this…</p>\n<p>MICHAEL: How long has this been around? Like a year?</p>\n<p>LINDA: But that’s not it, anyway. It’s the four of them just getting together.</p>\n<p>PAUL: [hesitating] But that’s – that’s not far off it, you know. I mean…</p>\n<p>LINDA: What?</p>\n<p>PAUL: I mean, Yoko’s very much to do with it.</p>\n<p>LINDA: Mm.</p>\n<p>PAUL: ‘Cause she’s very much to do with it from John’s angle, that’s the thing, you know. And I – the thing is that I – there’s— Again, like, there’s always only two answers. One is to fight it, and fight her, and try and get The Beatles back to four people without Yoko, and sort of ask her to sit down at the board meetings. Or else, the other thing is to just realize that she’s there, you know. And he’s not gonna sort of – split with her, just for our sakes.</p>\n<p>And – but then it’s not even so much of an obstacle, then, as long as we’re not trying to surmount it. And while we’re still trying to get over it, it’s an obstacle. [trying] But it isn’t, really. It’s not that bad, you know. They want to stay together, those two. So it’s alright. Let the young lovers stay together. [pause] But it shouldn’t be, “We can’t operate under these conditions, boy. You know, we’re coming out.” It’s like – it feels like we’re striking. That’s what it is. It’s like a strike, ‘cause work conditions aren’t right, you know. But… it’s not that bad.</p>\n<p>MICHAEL: But, he – he knows that, doesn’t he?</p>\n<p>PAUL: John knows that, sure. But he’s—</p>\n<p>MICHAEL: Does he talk about it at all?</p>\n<p>PAUL: No. But he’s – I mean, he’s— See, we’ve done a lot of Beatles now, we’ve had a lot of Beatles, you know, and we’ve got a lot out of Beatles. So that it – I think John’s saying now that honestly, if it came to a push between Yoko and The Beatles, it’s Yoko, you know.</p>\n<p>MICHAEL: Who’d stay.</p>\n<p>PAUL: Oh, sure.</p>\n<p>MICHAEL: But funny enough, the other day, when we were talking, he said that he really did not want not to be a Beatle. He said he really looked forward – not, you know. Meaning he didn’t want that screwed up.</p>\n<p>PAUL: Hm. [pause; unconvinced] Yeah, but it’s a difficult one, that, you know.</p>\n<p>LINDA: I think in their discussions, though, when as soon as you brought that up, John turned to her and said, “See, I told you.” I think it’s one of those things where he—</p>\n<p>PAUL: They do it. They tell each other, you know, when they get back home—</p>\n<p>LINDA: Yeah, but I bet he said to her, you know, “When I write, just sort of go away, when I’m with Paul.” But she said, “Oh, I don’t know…” [trailing off] It’s that kind of thing.</p>\n<p>PAUL: [quiet] I don’t know.</p>\n<p>(Note: Paul is certainly right, here, but that doesn’t discredit Linda’s or Michael Lindsay-Hogg’s views. John’s unwillingness to declare the dream is over has as much to do with still wanting Paul to come round to his side, as with John’s own insecurities and preternatural connive. But the breakup is inevitable no matter what anyone does, and John’s reticence is double-edged - with Paul, now desperately overreaching, prime to take the fall either way.)</p>\n<h3 id=\"im-all-for-that-but-if-it-screws-everything-up\">I’m all for that, but if it screws everything up</h3>\n<p>January 13th, 1969: While waiting for John and Yoko to arrive at the studio, Paul explains (to Let It Be director Michael Lindsay-Hogg) why it’s difficult for him to get round to talking to John alone anymore, without Yoko around.</p>\n<p>LINDA: I think he’d do it but I don’t think she’d do it.</p>\n<p>PAUL: See, but their point is, they’re – they’re trying to be as near together as they can.</p>\n<p>MICHAEL: For their own truth, and everything jazz.</p>\n<p>PAUL: Yeah, for everything like – so that if she sits over here, then it’s just slightly less good than if she’s sitting that near, very near to him. And if she’s touching him, then that’s even better, you know. And it’s like that. So that, okay, she’s prepared to sit here, but that’s – then there’s the beginning of the rock down. Then she’ll stay at home the next day, while he comes [to the studio], you know. And they see it like that. They see it that the more that they can stay together – and it’s right, in a way. I – you know. If that’s how you see it, then you can see that it would be a drag for that  for people to start saying, “Well, come to the meeting without her,” you know, “I’d rather talk without her,” ’cause it starts separating you again, from her. Which is like, see, it’s very ideological. Which is, you know, it’s probably how it should be.</p>\n<p>MICHAEL: I’m all for that. I mean, if that’s what they want to do. But then if it screws everything up for everybody else, then they’ve got to think about it.</p>\n<p>PAUL: [reserved] Well. I don’t know, you know. You see, they – they’d say that the other way, that—</p>\n<p>MICHAEL: That you’d have to adjust to them.</p>\n<p>PAUL: [weary] —that the other way is true, yeah. You know, that if they do what we want to do, then it might screw it up for them, you know. And they don’t want to be screwed up.</p>\n<h3 id=\"tell-him-hes-on-pins-and-needles\">Tell him he’s on pins and needles</h3>\n<p>January 13th, 1969 (Twickenham Film Studios, London): After waiting for John (and Yoko) to arrive for over an hour, Neil Aspinall returns to inform Paul that their continued attempts to call John have been unsuccessful. This prompts filmmaker Michael Lindsay-Hogg to make an uncharitable joke about removing Yoko to solve John’s unresponsiveness (John letting Yoko speak for him even during band meetings being one of the topics Paul, Linda, Neil, Ringo, and Michael have been discussing all morning). Paul wonders darkly if John has followed George’s example and gone on strike. (Note: Follows directly after this audio clip.)</p>\n<p>NEIL: Mal’s trying to ring him.</p>\n<p>PAUL: Yeah?</p>\n<p>NEIL: We found [the phone] engaged.</p>\n<p>PAUL: Found engaged?</p>\n<p>NEIL: [inaudible] —they have it off the hook.</p>\n<p>PAUL: Mm.</p>\n<p>RINGO: Send him a telegram.</p>\n<p>LINDA: Tell him [Paul]’s on pins and needles, wondering what’s happened to him. [Paul laughs bleakly] Yeah, I thought of that last night, sending him a telegram.</p>\n<p>MICHAEL: Did anybody speak to him last night? Does that—</p>\n<p>NEIL: No, it was the same last night.</p>\n<p>MICHAEL: Maybe if [Yoko] stayed in the black bag, that would count as— [inaudible; drowned out by voice marking tape slate] But not talking. [laughs] Putting that lid on the parrot’s cage. [long pause; Paul whistling; Michael sighing]</p>\n<p>PAUL: … And then there were two. [laughs]</p>\n<h3 id=\"writing-a-song-with-him-is-a-bit-embarrassing\">Writing a song with him is a bit embarrassing</h3>\n<p>January 13th, 1969: As Paul and Neil Aspinall discuss John and Yoko’s persistently conjoined state and how difficult it is to speak with John on a personal level, Paul brings up a failed attempt to write ‘I Will’ alone with John - and Yoko. While Paul contends that Yoko didn’t interfere with them at all, he admits that the very fact of her being there affected his ability to work and engage with John. Deflecting, Paul maintains that he is no position to tell John what he can or can’t do within their partnership, and explains that they’ve been falling out of tandem with each other since The Beatles stopped touring. (Note: This dialogue follows directly after this post.)</p>\n<p>LINDA: I don’t know, but that’s what I—</p>\n<p>NEIL: Yes, I think a lot of people get to have the impression that whenever John talks these days, it’s like, oh – Yoko’s talking to [for] him.</p>\n<p>PAUL: Yeah.</p>\n<p>NEIL: Or he shuts up, and that’s it, he doesn’t do it for you. And then that becomes a dream. [inaudible]</p>\n<p>PAUL: Sure.</p>\n<p>NEIL: Not ever, like, talking to him – like I’m talking to you now. Like now I’m talking to Paul, I’m not talking to Linda.</p>\n<p>PAUL: Right.</p>\n<p>NEIL: But when you’re talking to John, you always – these days, anyway – tend to think that you’re talking to Yoko more than you’re talking to John. And that’s when it becomes a drag.</p>\n<p>PAUL: [furtive] That’s why I say writing a song with him is a bit embarrassing, because I do think it sort of – I mean, I start examining my motives, with Yoko there… And it’s probably silly of me! It’s probably silly, because like, Yoko’s not what we’re all sort of thinking she is.</p>\n<p>NEIL: You see, I wouldn’t mind if she would just… wouldn’t say as much. Otherwise.</p>\n<p>PAUL: [weary] Well, that – of course that would be great, you know.</p>\n<p>NEIL: [laughs; bleak] Yeah. ‘Cause I just feel that it’s like – it’s you and John that are writing the songs together. You know, I mean, I’m not, I’m not— [inaudible; Linda’s and Ringo’s voices]</p>\n<p>PAUL: Yeah.</p>\n<p>NEIL: It’s just like, that – she’d start interjecting that you’d… hurt him, and—</p>\n<p>PAUL: Yeah, no, she would—</p>\n<p>NEIL: But you know, she probably wouldn’t—</p>\n<p>PAUL: No, she isn’t—</p>\n<p>NEIL: But that’s – you know.</p>\n<p>PAUL: Yeah, see, that’s the thing. The only one time we’ve actually done it, she’s agreed. She really is alright. It’s like, it’s the thought of her being there when some of—  [faltering] And then you don’t talk to John, so then he doesn’t talk to you, you know. And it’s like, you can screw it up just as much because she’s there, as – as John’s relying on her because she’s there. So that’s the thing. You know, but I mean, like, you’ll notice, if John – if you’re onto a beam with John about something, then he really isn’t, you know, he really won’t let Yoko talk about it. Because he knows when you’re on a beam, and he knows about it, and you’ll – you can talk straighter to him.</p>\n<p>But it’s like, we did ‘I Will’. We tried, we were trying to get the last verse to ‘I Will’, and eventually I just ended up doing it, because it – we couldn’t actually do it. [pause; trying] But – I mean, Yoko really tried to stay out of it, [and] just sort of – got on with something, but she just really… you know. They’re onto that thing. They just want to be near to each other. So I just think it’s just silly of me, or of anyone, to try and say to him, “No, you can’t,” you know. It’s like, ‘cause – okay, they’re – they’re going overboard about it, but John always does! And Yoko probably always does. So that’s their scene. You can’t go saying – you know, “Don’t go overboard about this thing. Be sensible about it. Don’t bring it to meetings.” It’s his decision, that. It’s – it’s none of our business, to start interfering in that. Even when it comes into our business, you still can’t really say much, unless – except, “Look, I don’t like it, John.” And then he can say, well, “Screw you,” or, “I like it,” or, “Well, I won’t do it so much,” or blablabla. Like, that’s the only way, you know. To tell John about that.</p>\n<p>MICHAEL: Have you done that already?</p>\n<p>PAUL: Well, I told him I didn’t like writing songs… with him and Yoko.</p>\n<p>MICHAEL: Were you writing much more before she came around—?</p>\n<p>PAUL: Oh yeah, sure.</p>\n<p>MICHAEL: Or had you – cooled it a bit, then? Before her.</p>\n<p>RINGO: Before Yoko got there.</p>\n<p>PAUL: [restrained] Yeah, cooled it, cooled it. Sure. We’d cooled it because… not playing together. Ever since we didn’t play together—</p>\n<p>MICHAEL: Onstage, you mean.</p>\n<p>PAUL: Yes. With the band. Because we lived together, and we played together. We were in the same hotel, up at the same time every morning, doing this all day. And this – I mean, this, you know, it doesn’t matter what you do, [but] just as long as you’re this close all day, something grows, you know. In some ways. And when you’re not this close, only, just physically… something goes.</p>\n<p>MICHAEL: Right.</p>\n<p>PAUL: So then you can come together to record, and stuff, but you still sort of lose the… [hesitating] Actually, musically, you know, we really – we can play better than we’ve ever been able to play, you know. Like, I really think that. I think, like – [laughs; bleak] we’re – we’re alright on that. It’s just that – being together thing, you know.</p>\n<p>(Note: Projections abound. Also note that John and Paul had in the past written several songs together in the crowded witness of rowdy tour vans, studios, et al, with no difficulty whatsoever - making Paul’s indefinable unease with Yoko’s presence all the more curious for what it implies. In direct relation to John, whatever Paul recognises of himself and his feelings is reflected back at him by Yoko, forcing him to confront these feelings in an explicitly manifested form. Paul’s consequent inability to write in the face of the matter is no wonder, then - especially for a musician whose lifelong efficiency in the writing process relies on steering very well clear of any introspective navel-gazing. And whose most arguably expressive lyrics are ingenuous efforts directed towards someone other than himself.</p>\n<p>It is unspecified when this particular writing session for ‘I Will’ took place, but if John, Paul, and Yoko were entirely on their own, sans engineers, producers, etc., it is possible it occurred in Paul’s house, where John and Yoko were residing for a time in 1968.</p>\n<p>As for what Paul and Neil are intimating about earlier on, and whether they’re only speculating from their impression of how Yoko feels about John and Paul’s partnership, or actually recalling something said outright in a past incident - my guess is as good as yours. It seems to echo Yoko’s cruelly-timed 1981 comment to Philip Norman: “John said that no one ever hurt him the way Paul hurt him.”)</p>\n<h3 id=\"yoko-talked-for-john\">Yoko talked for John</h3>\n<p>January 13th, 1969: As everyone waits for John and Yoko to arrive at the studio, Paul talks disconsolately about John’s evasiveness, and how John’s habit of using Yoko as his mouthpiece drove George to walk out of a band meeting the previous day. Linda, Neil Aspinall, and Let It Be filmmaker Michael Lindsay-Hogg share their thoughts.</p>\n<p>MICHAEL: But do you think if you put any, uh, pressure on him, that he’d – go your way a bit more?</p>\n<p>PAUL: [guarded] Who’s this?</p>\n<p>MICHAEL: John.</p>\n<p>PAUL: I don’t know. [long pause] But I don’t know, you know, I can’t… [quiet] I just can’t be bothered doing all that.</p>\n<p>MICHAEL: Hm. [awkward] Hm. [silence; fidgeting]</p>\n<p>PAUL: [tired] Do you want to try and ring John? [long pause]</p>\n<p>NEIL: Mal or I can do it.</p>\n<p>PAUL: Try him.</p>\n<p>LINDA: The thing is, the four of you. The four of them just talking.</p>\n<p>MICHAEL: Did you – did you not talk about it much, last night?</p>\n<p>LINDA: Well, there was just too many…</p>\n<p>NEIL: People.</p>\n<p>LINDA: Mm.</p>\n<p>PAUL: John didn’t talk. You see, Yoko talked… for John.</p>\n<p>MICHAEL: Did George stay?</p>\n<p>PAUL: Oh, well, then – in the middle of all that, actually—</p>\n<p>LINDA: Hopefully. [Linda thought Michael was asking if George, who quit the band on January 10th, had decided in the meeting to stay in The Beatles.]</p>\n<p>PAUL: George went. You know, “See ya.”</p>\n<p>LINDA: But he was waiting for it to stop, you know. That’s why he was stepping out. But when he saw it wasn’t… The thing is like – a meeting without Yoko, just once, and she’d—</p>\n<p>NEIL: I don’t think we’ll ever get that. [long pause]</p>\n<p>PAUL: You see, that’s it, you know.</p>\n<p>NEIL: That is.</p>\n<p>PAUL: That is a big sort of crunch, that.</p>\n<p>NEIL: You’d have to – you’d have to say it to John, then. And then it’s going to be like, “Well, I’m not doing it,” or, “I am doing it,” and whichever way it goes – but at least whenever John decides what he wants with that, that will be that.</p>\n<h3 id=\"lunchtime-i-really-dont-like-to-be-smothered\">(Lunchtime) I really don’t like to be smothered</h3>\n<p>January 13th, 1969 (Twickenham Film Studios, London): Over lunch, the remaining Beatles touch on George’s resignation from the band on the 10th, as well as a group meeting held the previous day which ended in less than desirable circumstances (with George leaving the room, frustrated by John’s persistently Yoko-filtered standard of communication). While Yoko contends that it would be easy for John (and Paul) to regain George’s favour, John points out that this is a more deeply-rooted issue than it may seem, compounded over the years by John and Paul’s treatment of George and his defaulted status within the group. Upon this problem of overriding egos, however, Paul suggests (passive-aggressively) that it isn’t just the Lennon-and-McCartney tandem that is causing George upset and consternation.</p>\n<p>PAUL: [bleak; joking] So where’s George?</p>\n<p>RINGO: It smells like George is here.</p>\n<p>YOKO: [to John] Well, you can get back George so easily, you know that. You know, Paul and—</p>\n<p>JOHN: But it’s not that easy, because it’s a festering wound—</p>\n<p>PAUL: Yeah.</p>\n<p>LINDA: Yeah.</p>\n<p>JOHN: —that we’ve allowed to – and yesterday we allowed it go even deeper, but we didn’t give him any bandages. And it’s only because George, uh, when he comes up, when he is that part of him… We have egos. We can’t help but have—</p>\n<p>RINGO: Well, it can be a burden on him.</p>\n<p>JOHN: I’ll have, you know—well, look, you do— [inaudible]</p>\n<p>RINGO: [inaudible]</p>\n<p>PAUL: Rosé.</p>\n<p>YOKO: Can I have one too [inaudible]? But if you wanted it badly enough, you have to, you know—</p>\n<p>MAL: What do you want, uh, Paul?</p>\n<p>PAUL: Rosé, please, for me. Linda?</p>\n<p>LINDA: No thank you.</p>\n<p>JOHN: [inaudible] I wouldn’t say it’s my ego. It was yesterday, really – or, or even the day before when we went to George’s—</p>\n<p>PAUL: I sure as hell know I wouldn’t like you to.</p>\n<p>JOHN: What?</p>\n<p>PAUL: Dig in your heels.</p>\n<p>YOKO: Your ego’s great, by the way.</p>\n<p>PAUL: ’Cause if I’m to – if I’m to look at either of you, you know, I really don’t like to be smothered. You know—</p>\n<p>YOKO: No, no no—</p>\n<p>PAUL: You know, if I could – if you were in a shop on a shelf, I’d— [inaudible] —or whatever it is—</p>\n<p>JOHN: I’m just trying to ask [inaudible] – do I want him back, Paul, I’m just asking, do I want it back? Whatever it is.</p>\n<h3 id=\"do-i-want-him-back\">Do I want him back?</h3>\n<p>January 13th, 1969 (Twickenham FIlm Studios, London): As the problem of George’s current resignation from the band is discussed, John makes it about him and Paul wonders what it’s all worth. (Note: As my transcripts for this tape undergo constant revision and it’s been an ongoing agony trying to determine who is addressing whom about what in reference to whom throughout this tape under a deluge of possible interpretations, this fragment - which follows right after this previous post - is about all I’m confident with sharing at the moment.)</p>\n<p>JOHN: I’m just trying to ask [inaudible] – do I want him back, Paul, I’m just asking, do I want it back? Whatever it is. [Do I want it back] Enough?</p>\n<p>YOKO: Right, do you want this, to have George back, you have [inaudible]—</p>\n<p>JOHN: Then if it is enough, I’d have to swallow my ego for you, I’d have to smother me jealousy for you—</p>\n<p>PAUL: Mm.</p>\n<p>JOHN: —to carry on for whatever reasons there is.</p>\n<h3 id=\"ive-always-played-that-one\">I’ve always played that one</h3>\n<p>January 13th, 1969 (Twickenham Film Studios, London): John contends with how the force of his partnership with Paul and his relationship with Yoko has negatively affected George and perhaps directly contributed to George’s walkout on the group three days prior. (Note: Follows shortly after this clip. My apologies for the vagueness; this is a very difficult excerpt to interpret, and I change my mind about it constantly, as the emotional nuances of what is being conveyed shift significantly depending on whom you presume John is speaking to (Paul or Yoko) about whom (Paul, George, or Yoko) and whom it is in reference to or is directed towards (Paul, George, or Yoko), word to word. I did initially try to indicate who’s who in brackets next to the relevant pronouns, but the transcript got dreadfully cluttered, and as I said, I have hardly nailed myself to a mast. Basically, this is a fannish Rorschach test and Your Mileage May Vary.)</p>\n<p>JOHN: And it’s just that, you know. It’s only this year that you’ve suddenly realised, like who I am, or who he is, or anything like that. But the thing is—</p>\n<p>PAUL: But I still haven’t realised that. What I’m – the process.</p>\n<p>YOKO: [inaudible]</p>\n<p>JOHN: Yeah yeah, but you realise that some – like you were saying, like George was some other part. But up till then, you’d had a – your thing that carried you forward. [pause; Yoko speaking?] I know, I’d adjusted before you. Alright, that would make me hipper than you, but I know that I’d adjusted to you before that – for selfish reasons, and for good reasons, not knowing what else to do, and for all these reasons. I’d adjusted to all these and allowed you [inaudible] – you know, if you wanted to let me— [inaudible] —very, very… whatever it is. But this year, you’ve seen, you’ve seen what you’ve been doing, and what everybody’s been doing, and not only did we feel guilty about it, the way we all feel guilty about our relationship to each other, because we could do more…</p>\n<p>YOKO: [inaudible]</p>\n<p>JOHN: I know, the thing is that I’m – I can’t – I’m not putting any blame on you for only suddenly realising it, see, because it’s [inaudible] our game, you know; it might have been masochistic, but the goal was still the same, self-preservation. And I knew what I liked about that. I know where the – even if I didn’t know where I was at, you know, the table’s there, and… let him do what he wants, and George too, you know…</p>\n<p>PAUL: I know. I know—</p>\n<p>JOHN: And I have won.</p>\n<p>PAUL: But this thing has been—</p>\n<p>JOHN: But I think you—</p>\n<p>PAUL: You have—</p>\n<p>JOHN: I feel it’s you.</p>\n<p>PAUL: Whatever it is, you have. Yeah, I know. Well, I’ve had [inaudible]—</p>\n<p>JOHN: Because you – ’cause you’ve suddenly got it all, you see.</p>\n<p>PAUL: Mm.</p>\n<p>JOHN: I know that, because of the way I am, like when we were in Mendips, like I said, “Do you like me?” or whatever it is. I’ve always – uh, played that one.</p>\n<p>PAUL: [laughs nervously] Yes.</p>\n<p>JOHN: So.</p>\n<p>PAUL: Uh, I’d been watching, I’d been watching. I’d been watching the picture.</p>\n<p>YOKO: Go back to George. What are we going to do about George?</p>\n<p>JOHN: Yeah, I’m – yeah, sure. But this year, suddenly, it’s all happened to you, and you sort of go – you’re taking the blame, suddenly, as if, uh… Oh, he’d say, “Oh yeah, you know [inaudible],” as if I’ve never known it. And then he thought, “Fucking hell. I know what he’s like. I know he used to kick people. I know how he connived with Len, Ivan. I know him, you know? Fuck him.” And then, oh, but, but right, I’ve done such things… all that. So you’ve taken the five years that [inaudible], you’ve taken the five years of trouble, this year. So half of me says, alright, you know I’ll do anything to save you, to help you. And the other half of me says, well serves him fucking right. I’ve chewed through fucking shit because of him for five years, and he’s only just realised what he was doing [to her?]. So, and that’s something – we’ve both known it, you know? [laughs] And it is incredible. [pause]</p>\n<p>PAUL: Yeah.</p>\n<h3 id=\"like-you-joining-the-band-instead-of-pete\">Like you joining the band instead of Pete</h3>\n<p>January 13th, 1969 (Twickenham Film Studios, London): During a discussion on how the rest of the group should move forward after George’s departure on the 10th, John wonders if they should get George back at all, suggesting his role as a Beatle is replaceable (unlike his own or Paul’s), and likens this unkindly to how Ringo first replaced Pete Best. Paul notes that John has been the top buck in getting himself heard (and getting his way) since the inception of the group (which John protests) and quickly reassures Ringo when he wryly declares himself to be little more than rabbit food for the group.</p>\n<p>Paul admits that both he and John have done one over on George, albeit unconsciously as an effect of the competition and unaware of how it may have hurt George in the process, but John argues that he’s known since early childhood how manipulative he himself can be, and has tried to curb it to little avail.</p>\n<p>PAUL: See, I’m just assuming he’s coming back, you know. I tell you, I’m just assuming he’s coming back.</p>\n<p>RINGO: If he wants—</p>\n<p>JOHN: What if he isn’t?</p>\n<p>PAUL: If he isn’t, then… if he isn’t, then it’s a new problem.</p>\n<p>RINGO: He would like the four of us to sit down.</p>\n<p>JOHN: It’s like we’ve said—</p>\n<p>PAUL: Yeah.</p>\n<p>RINGO: He wants the four of us to actually—</p>\n<p>JOHN: See, if we want it – if we do want it, I still won’t tour, man, but I do want to—</p>\n<p>PAUL: But you seem to – you seem to think—</p>\n<p>JOHN: But if we do end up deciding we want it, as a policy, I can go along with that. Because the policy has kept us together.</p>\n<p>RINGO: But the thing is that if we want him—</p>\n<p>JOHN: If we want him, because we want him – but the thing is, like George said, it’s that The Beatles, to me, isn’t just limited to the four of us. I think that I, alone, could be a Beatle. [to Paul] I think you could. [to Ringo] I’m not sure whether you could, because you’re doing… Well, like, but I’m just telling you what I think! I don’t think The Beatles revolve around the four people! It might be like a job—</p>\n<p>PAUL: But you know what, John, I’ll tell you one thing—</p>\n<p>JOHN: [to Ringo] It’s like you joining the band instead of Pete. It’s like – to me, it is like that.</p>\n<p>PAUL: Tell you what— [inaudible] Let me tell you what I think. [pause; inaudible] —thing is this. [to John] You have always been at the front of the chute. Now, there have been some secondary rungs, but George has been third rung—</p>\n<p>RINGO: And I’ve been the cabbage.</p>\n<p>PAUL: [immediately] Never.</p>\n<p>JOHN: [dismissive] No, we haven’t—</p>\n<p>PAUL: No, just, no – listen here. You’re the rabbit, he’s right.</p>\n<p>JOHN: But not always, though—</p>\n<p>PAUL: [anxious] No, listen here – listen – always! But! But! [pause] I do think – no, I do think that as grim as it all is, that [George]’s right. And I do think that like our sole approach is exactly what he’s been saying. And that our brains sort of… con him. It’s all nothing. I do think that is a – I mean— [stumbling] As a first way out, I can’t really even say that, but I do think, you know, that when you get right down to it—</p>\n<p>JOHN: Yes.</p>\n<p>PAUL: ’Cause the moments of clarity, that I’ve just been – are just so innocent, and so simple, that all my connive, and all my – urge, or— [inaudible]</p>\n<p>JOHN: But don’t give me like – ’cause I’ve at least been aware of my conniving since fourteen. Real aware of it.</p>\n<p>PAUL: Sure.</p>\n<p>JOHN: And before that. You realize that I’ve known I’ve been conniving from – from Dovedale, you know that. I’ve been aware of that. Just because – I don’t know whether it’s him. It’s not him. It’s just me. That I’ve realized where it’s nowhere – but the thing is, I only know where it is when I’m in the middle of all of it—</p>\n<p>PAUL: Yeah.</p>\n<p>JOHN: —that I am sort of at it again. And that’s why I’ve had to fight for the last three years. And I’ve done it – the other way. Just – rather than allow myself to connive, I thought, “Stop it now. Stop it.”</p>\n<h3 id=\"i-want-you-all-for-whatever-you-are\">I want you all for whatever you are</h3>\n<p>January 13th, 1969 (Twickenham Film Studios, London): In the middle of a personal discussion with John and Ringo about the band, its tenuous future, and their relationships with one another, Paul (in response to John’s admission of insecurity in the face of external pressures from the public and media to perform) is emphatic about his faith in them and their abilities and contends that whatever interpersonal problems they have can be resolved, for what their music is worth. (Note: I am sheepishly and frustratedly uncertain of my transcription. And yes, Yoko and Linda seem to be having a fascinating conversation about Paul and George.)</p>\n<p>PAUL: [trying] If all of you were for sale on a shop, I’d want you as, you know, that, but I really don’t want you as that!</p>\n<p>JOHN: Yes.</p>\n<p>PAUL: But I want you as that! I don’t want him as that. You see, I want you to want yours. You’re [inaudible]. Ringo wanted— When I say those things, you know, I can hear myself sort of – but I don’t know what it is you want me to do! In period and in fact, I want you all for whatever you are. Because I’m placing it – after all the bests, and all it bloody does, and what’s best, is that what you are is alright. Because if it isn’t, then it’s just stupid of me [inaudible], you know? Because it’s what you are, and I would [inaudible] anywhere! So I’m placing all the money, all the fame, and everything, on what you are. So if this is what you two are, then get on with it.</p>\n<h3 id=\"it-doesnt-give-me-the-same-satisfaction-anymore\">It doesn’t give me the same satisfaction anymore</h3>\n<p>January 13th, 1969 (Twickenham Film Studios, London): While Yoko and Paul conduct their own conversation with each other, Linda talks to John about the inevitable difficulties any relationship faces - even in the context of a musical partnership - and why it doesn’t prove the relationship itself is an expired one. John (inexplicably or not) laments the the White Album doesn’t sound like the genuine, inspired band collaboration they achieved in the past.</p>\n<p>LINDA: You were saying that—</p>\n<p>JOHN: [pained] It’s like George said. It just doesn’t give me the same sort of satisfaction anymore. Because of the compromise we’d have to make, to be together. [long pause] You know, it’s that the end result of the records now aren’t… enough. Because now, we – we know it so clearly, how we arrived at it, and for what it was and all. Before, it was always a surprise when we – you know. We weren’t so aware of how we reacted to it. When the – something came out, like Revolver or Pepper or whatever, there was still that element of surprise that we didn’t know where it came from. But now we know exactly where it came from, and how we arrived at that particular noise, and how it could have been… much better. Or it needn’t have been at all. The only way to do it – satisfactory, for y– yourself – is to do it on your own. And then that’s fucking hard.</p>\n<p>LINDA: But you were saying yesterday, you know. And you know something, you – you’ve always been sort of thinking that it can’t be any better than it was; you’re not just a studio musician. You always say it. I mean, [inaudible] – I’m saying, hey, you make good music together. And you like it or not, you know.</p>\n<p>JOHN: [furtive] I like it.</p>\n<p>LINDA: And making good music is also—</p>\n<p>JOHN: But it’s just—</p>\n<p>LINDA: It’s really hard working at a relationship.</p>\n<p>JOHN: I – I know.</p>\n<p>LINDA: Of course! That’s what you said yesterday. It happens all the time, you know. And you also said you wanted [inaudible] The Beatles—</p>\n<p>JOHN: It’s like all of us are dissatisfied with The Beatles LP. Now, it’s not because the way we got on doing it, because the end result was – was as good as it could’ve been. And – I don’t know what the reason could be. [offhand] Mal, could you get a little glass of wine?</p>\n<p>MAL: Yeah. Red, or—?</p>\n<p>JOHN: If I get down to my contributions, then I’m satisfied, you know. But the whole thing is less satisfactory.</p>\n<p>RINGO: But I enjoy it more.</p>\n<p>JOHN: But individually. Name any of them! There is no [inaudible]. Even George’s numbers are more satisfactory than any numbers we’ve done before. But as a whole thing, it’s just not satisfactory to me.</p>\n<p>RINGO: Well, I mean, I dig it far more than Sgt. Pepper or anything—</p>\n<p>LINDA: You know, it really—</p>\n<p>JOHN: And I dig it too. I dig it, individually, far more than Sgt. Pepper. But as a whole – as a Beatles thing, I think it didn’t – it couldn’t work as a Beatles thing. I think it’s one of the best Beatles work we could have, you know, but as a – as an entity, as a whole coming out of all of us here – no.</p>\n<h3 id=\"youre-unsure-whether-to-go-left-or-right\">You’re unsure whether to go left or right</h3>\n<p>January 13th, 1969 (Twickenham Studios, London): As Paul encourages an unconfident Ringo to go ahead with his plans to record a solo LP, John hedgingly brings up his own apprehensions about following his instincts (especially when he’s not even sure what he really wants to do). In their inimitable and emotionally non-committal fashion, John and Paul engage in metaphors about intentions, conveying these intentions in actions, and how these actions may be conveyed by those who see it. (Basically: what John and Paul talk about when they talk about love.)</p>\n<p>PAUL: [to Ringo] The great thing is that you singing like how you really sing – will be it. It will be!</p>\n<p>RINGO: Yes, but the only way is to do it on your own.</p>\n<p>PAUL: Until then – yeah, sure. Until then – until you reach how you really sing, you’ll sing your half-soul.</p>\n<p>RINGO: Yeah.</p>\n<p>PAUL: And it’s probably when we’re all very old, that we’ll all sing together.</p>\n<p>RINGO: Yeah.</p>\n<p>PAUL: And we’ll all really sing, and we’ll all show each other how good we are, and in fact we’ll die, then, I don’t know. [Linda laughs; diffident] Probably, you know, probably something sappy or soft like that… I don’t know, but really, I mean, i– it’s really down to all those sort of simple, silly things to me.</p>\n<p>YOKO: But those are the important things, you know.</p>\n<p>PAUL: It’s got to be simple. It’s got to be simple. It can’t be A plus B equals X plus Y plus Z, because that’s them, you know. And it couldn’t be—</p>\n<p>JOHN: [quiet] Maybe that’s what’s evading me.</p>\n<p>PAUL: Yes. [sincere] But it’s okay, that, you know.</p>\n<p>JOHN: [hesitating] I just, uh… because I’m not really sure what or how I feel about it.</p>\n<p>PAUL: No, but you’re—</p>\n<p>JOHN: Because any time—</p>\n<p>PAUL: You’re unsure because you’re not sure whether to go left or right on an issue. You’ve noticed the two ways open to us. You know the way we all want to go. And you know the way you want to go. Which is positive! ‘Cause you want to go – now, okay. So your positive thing might actually be to kick that telephone box in. It might occasionally be to do that. So you know that’s the way you’ve gotta go.</p>\n<p>YOKO: Everybody would want to see that, actually.</p>\n<p>PAUL: But you don’t want to actually look like you’re kicking the telephone box in. So you have to sort of say to everyone, “Look at that over there, everyone!” And while they’re not looking, you’ll kick the telephone box in, and sort of— [whistles innocently]</p>\n<p>JOHN: I don’t think that’s a fair representation. [laughs]</p>\n<p>PAUL: [conceding] Oh, well, it involves me, that’s me. I do that, too. And I think we all do that. But I think the answer is, that – while you’ve got us all looking at nothing over there, and you’ve thrown us for a minute, we would actually all have dug to see you kick that telephone box in.  Because we wanna see you do it.</p>\n<p>YOKO: But we’d have to say it too, though. That’s another thing.</p>\n<p>PAUL: We would actually want to watch the Steve McQueen film, where he kicks the telephone box in. We all want to see that. You know. And I really think that’s—</p>\n<p>YOKO: Yes, but sometimes it’s very—</p>\n<p>JOHN: But it must be our own faults, that we’ve built it up that I can’t kick the telephone box – apart from it being my fault—</p>\n<p>PAUL: You can. You could.</p>\n<p>JOHN: But – the feeling that, that – that I – like Ringo said about his album, that what – we’re – you know. I won’t do it, ‘cause I’m gonna let us down, or – look a fool.</p>\n<p>PAUL: Yeah.</p>\n<p>JOHN: You know, and we’ve each done that to each— [audio glitch] That bit.</p>\n<p>PAUL: We all know we can do that, you know. I mean, I’m really trying to sort of learn, really— [inaudible] —meaning.</p>\n<p>JOHN: Well, it’s like – we’ve all found – we can do it on our own.</p>\n<p>PAUL: But on our own, I’m just gonna have to sort of just say it to you all. Through the song. Now I know if I – when I’m saying to you all, “Listen, this is how this song goes,” you know, then I know if I half-tell you how it goes, that there’ll be two of you who’ll like it, and then there’s only [inaudible]. You know.</p>\n<p>JOHN: Yeah.</p>\n<p>PAUL: A certain amount of you will like it, and some of you won’t. Because, and I know – and you know, this is where it gets heavy. Because you’ve got to blame yourself, for that. Because I know I half-sang it.</p>\n<p>JOHN: Yes.</p>\n<p>PAUL: And I know that if – say I’m pissed, at the end of an evening, and I just, and I get on a piano because I really just want to get on a piano. And I’m singing because I don’t particularly want to show off, too. I want to really sing this song, now, and say what I wanna say, and so on and so on and so on. I’ll do it, and everyone in that room will dig it, because it’s me really doing it. And I know that we all have this. [inaudible] And everyone will be really crazy about it. Now if I were really doing it, everyone will listen, and everyone will dig it, and no one will go against it. It’s when I half-mean it, or it’s when I nearly mean it, but there’s – there’s always that one person that can spot that – that—</p>\n<p>JOHN: Yeah.</p>\n<p>PAUL: Spot them doing a mistake. You know, there’s always someone who can spot that little bit where Charlie Chester didn’t quite mean it, or Charlie Drake, when he didn’t quite mean the joke. You know, it’s all in that.</p>\n<p>YOKO: But then sometimes it doesn’t matter to you, so.</p>\n<p>PAUL: It’s like if we could really… See, that’s why I think this is where we’ve got a problem now, you know.</p>\n<p>(Note: Significant - and frustrating, and hilariously sad - in hindsight, for reasons that are obvious. Paul: “I’m telling you to leave me in the hopes that you’ll tell me you won’t, because it’ll prove you still care about me and want to stay.” John: “I’m telling you I’m moving on in the hopes that you’ll tell me not to, because it’ll prove you still care about me and want me to stay.”)</p>\n<h3 id=\"how-much-more-have-i-done-towards-helping-you-write\">How much more have I done towards helping you write?</h3>\n<p>January 13th, 1969 (Twickenham Film Studios, London): John and Paul have an obfuscating conversation about their songwriting partnership and creative process, which has been incapacitated by a lack of direction, misplaced (misread) intentions, and the unmet (unrealised) expectations they’ve inflicted upon each other. (In other words: issues. And some projecting of issues onto George, for good measure.)</p>\n<p>PAUL: That’s why I think this – we’ve got this problem now, you know. What I’d like to do, is for the four of us – and you know, we’ve all have done [inaudible] things – to different degrees, I see it as you go one way, you go one way, George goes one way, and me another. But I know it will apply to all us, if one day, we can all be singing like we’re singing, [to Ringo] you can be drumming like you’re drumming, George can be really playing – I mean, like he plays, not as if I’m trying to make him play like me. But now it’s like I keep trying to make him play like – how I’ve played guitar—</p>\n<p>JOHN: But you don’t, you see. The point – the point that we both – or, mainly me—</p>\n<p>PAUL: Back up, back up.</p>\n<p>JOHN: Yeah, okay. Is that you try and make George play… competently, because you’re afraid that how he’ll play won’t be like you want him to play. And that’s what we did. And that’s what you did to me. [pause]</p>\n<p>PAUL: Yeah.</p>\n<p>JOHN: And – I – that’s the difference with you saying that the competen— [audio glitch] —so annoyed by the conniving on The Beatles album, was that I’d—</p>\n<p>PAUL: Yeah.</p>\n<p>JOHN: I got to a bit where I thought – it’s no good, me telling you what or how to do it, you know? All I tried to do on that album was just sing it to you like I was drunk, you know.</p>\n<p>PAUL: Yeah.</p>\n<p>JOHN: Just did me best to say, “Look, this, this stands up on its own.”</p>\n<p>PAUL: Yeah.</p>\n<p>JOHN: And I’m not doing this quite well, ‘cause I – like even with ‘Don’t Let Me Down’, the first time I sang it. Because I hadn’t allowed meself to say it, as a whole song.</p>\n<p>PAUL: Yeah.</p>\n<p>JOHN: I couldn’t work – it was only after we’d done it that I’d realised  it was done. You know, and on The Beatles album, I just sort of said, “[inaudible] This is me singing it drunk, but I’m pretending as if I’m not. What would you do with it?”</p>\n<p>PAUL: [laughs] Drunk.</p>\n<p>JOHN: You know? “George, you play whatever you like.”</p>\n<p>PAUL: Yeah.</p>\n<p>JOHN: You know, and that’s what it was. It wasn’t – it wasn’t the arrogance of, “Listen. This is it, baby.” It was that – I can’t tell you what to do because you won’t play, here, like how I think you should play.</p>\n<p>PAUL: Yeah, right.</p>\n<p>JOHN: And—</p>\n<p>PAUL: You see, that’s – that’s the thing.</p>\n<p>JOHN: I’m not going to tell you what to play—</p>\n<p>PAUL: That seems to be the trouble, is that—</p>\n<p>YOKO: It is. [pause]</p>\n<p>PAUL: Okay. And that’s great, you know. And then – it’s just that being able to say that, on the occasion. I just mean to say, “Look, I’m not going to say anything about the song, because – really, I’m going to really try, now—”</p>\n<p>JOHN: But we tried it—</p>\n<p>PAUL: “—to sing it to you—”</p>\n<p>JOHN: [exasperated] Yeah, I know, but you wouldn’t say—</p>\n<p>PAUL: Listen to me— [inaudible]</p>\n<p>JOHN: We arranged it, you know?</p>\n<p>PAUL: I know, I know.</p>\n<p>JOHN: You can’t see— Listen, uh, you— [inaudible]</p>\n<p>PAUL: I say that, of course, when [inaudible] when you say that to me, because I haven’t got it off of you.</p>\n<p>JOHN: Yeah, but the point is you—</p>\n<p>PAUL: And you’ve sort of – I think—</p>\n<p>JOHN: Well, I’m saying that ‘Dear Prudence’ is arranged. Can’t you hear bom, bom, bom, bom, bom…?</p>\n<p>PAUL: Yeah.</p>\n<p>JOHN: That – that is the arrangement, you know.</p>\n<p>PAUL: Yeah, well.</p>\n<p>JOHN: But I’m too frightened to say “This is it,” I just sit there and say, “Look, if you don’t come along, and play your bit, I won’t do the song,” you know? I can’t do any better than that. Don’t ask me for what boogie you’re gonna play on it.</p>\n<p>PAUL: Yeah.</p>\n<p>JOHN: Because… apart from not knowing, I can’t tell you better than you have, what grooves you can  play on it. You know, I just can’t work. I can’t do it like that. ‘Course I could, you know! But when you think of the other half of it, just think: how much more have I done towards helping you write? I’ve never told you what to sing, or what to play.</p>\n<p>PAUL: Yeah.</p>\n<p>JOHN: You know, I’ve always done the numbers like that. Now, the only regret, just for the past numbers, is when – because I’ve been so frightened, that I’ve allowed you to take it somewhere where I didn’t want—</p>\n<p>PAUL: Yeah.</p>\n<p>JOHN: —and then – my only chance was to let George [audio glitch] take over, or interest George in it, because I knew he’d—</p>\n<p>PAUL: Like ‘She Said, She Said’?</p>\n<p>LINDA: Yes, yes.</p>\n<p>JOHN: ‘She Said, She Said’. Then he’d – he’d– ’cause he’d take it as is. You know? [inaudible; drowned out by voice marking] So on that last album— [inaudible] —arrangements on it— [inaudible] —it’s probably George, you know. If there’s anything wrong with it. Because I don’t want your arrangement on it. I only want your… If you give me your suggestions, let me reject them, or in the case there’s one I like – it’s when we’re writing songs.</p>\n<p>PAUL: Mm.</p>\n<p>JOHN: The same goes for the arrangement. I don’t want it – to… [sighs] I don’t know.</p>\n<p>PAUL: No, I know. I know what you mean, yeah.</p>\n<p>YOKO: I know exactly what you mean.</p>\n<p>PAUL: Yeah, yeah—</p>\n<p>JOHN: I want it to be like I’m just doing it, but— [audio cuts off]</p>\n<h3 id=\"i-dont-hear-any-of-the-flutes-playing\">I don’t hear any of the flutes playing</h3>\n<p>January 13th, 1969 (Twickenham Studios, London): In the midst of a personal discussion about working together within the band, John tries to explain the disconnect in their process, and why he can’t envision their songs the way Paul can. As both John and Paul circle around the issues of honest communication and (living up to) each other’s expectations, they eventually project onto George bring George into the quandary of the Lennon-McCartney partnership.</p>\n<p>JOHN: And that’s all I did on the last album was say, “Okay, Paul, you’re out to decide where my songs are concerned, arrangement-wise.” [exasperated] I don’t know the songs, you know. I’d sooner just sing them, than have them turn into – into ‘Mr. Kite’, or anything else, where— I’ve accepted the problem from you that it needs arrangement. And then, because I’m an ape, I don’t know. I don’t see any further than me, the guitar, and the drums, and – and George Martin doing the— [audio glitch] I don’t hear any of the flutes playing, you know? I suppose I could hear ‘em if I sat down and worked very hard! I could turn out a mathematical drawing if you’d like, but I could never do it off me own backside, I always have to just – [brushing sound from strumming motion] do that, you know?</p>\n<p>PAUL: Yeah.</p>\n<p>JOHN: I mean—</p>\n<p>PAUL: [quiet] Yeah. Yeah. [pause] I’m onto the same thing, you know. That’s – that’s – we’re all at that. It is only, like, if you can just remember that we’re – you know. That the four of us are trying to do that. Because I mean, all of those things you say, you know, in some way, apply to me. Not all ways—</p>\n<p>JOHN: Yes, yes, because everything applies a little bit to you, too.</p>\n<p>PAUL: [inaudible] —it is just you saying it. They’re all – you know, in some way, to some degree, will apply to me.</p>\n<p>JOHN: ‘Cause once there was a period where none of us could actually, uh, say anything, about your criticisms.</p>\n<p>PAUL: [quiet] Yeah. Yeah.</p>\n<p>JOHN: [bleak] ‘Cause you would reject it all.</p>\n<p>PAUL: [quiet] Yeah, sure.</p>\n<p>JOHN: And so George and I would just go – you know, “I’ll give you a line here,” “Okay,” you know, “We’ll do four in a bar, and I’ll do…” And a lot of the times you were right.</p>\n<p>PAUL: Yeah.</p>\n<p>JOHN: But a lot of the times you were – [the songs were] the same as they always are. But I can’t see the answer to that.</p>\n<p>PAUL: No, but – no, that’s good you see. The thing is, like, within each other, within ourselves, we reach something that’s nearly perfect. And everyone else who’s listening will think, “That’s it. They’ve got it.” You know – you know what I mean. So okay, we know we nearly made it, but we’ve really made it, for everyone else. ‘Cause it’s okay, we’re into the fine, finest, finest technicalities – I mean, that’s where it’s at, you know. If one day, we can even keep all – if all the people who are listening to this, nearly nearly made it, they’ll think we’ve made it, you know. They’ll think that’s it. So okay, if we can nearly, if we can creep up on it – and that’s, see, that’s what I’m trying to do. Like last week, yesterday [inaudible] doing alright for me, I was really trying to just say to George, “Take it there,” you know, whereas I wouldn’t have gone [inaudible] and said, “Take it there – with diddle-a-diddle-a-da.” But I was trying last week, to say, “Now, take it over there, and it needs to be like – but, oh, what, like, whatever you—”</p>\n<p>JOHN: You see, the point is now – George – is we both did that to George, this time.</p>\n<p>PAUL: Mm.</p>\n<p>JOHN: And because of the build up to it, that – now he can’t even take that.</p>\n<p>PAUL: Treating him a bit like a mongrel, yeah.</p>\n<p>JOHN: He can’t even – you know. [audio glitch] It’s like if I say, “Alright, take it,” he’ll say, “Well, look, I can’t take it. I’ll forget it.”</p>\n<p>PAUL: Yeah…</p>\n<p>JOHN: I have to, uh—</p>\n<p>PAUL: ‘Cause he knows what we’re all about.</p>\n<p>JOHN: Yeah.</p>\n<p>PAUL: So he knows that when we say, “Take it,” we expect doo-doo-duh-duh-doo. If I said that, then you’d expect—</p>\n<p>JOHN: But it’s just that bit. The bit where we’ve – ‘I’ve Got A Feeling’.</p>\n<p>PAUL: Yeah.</p>\n<p>JOHN: We – there’s no way we could have translated it to him, to say… you know.</p>\n<h2 id=\"114\">1/14</h2>\n<h3 id=\"the-back-seat-of-my-car\">‘The Back Seat Of My Car’</h3>\n<p>January 14th, 1969 (Twickenham Film Studios, London): Paul plays work-in-progress ‘The Back Seat Of My Car’ for the first time in the studio.</p>\n<h3 id=\"its-just-for-you-that-i-sing-this-song-each-morning\">It’s just for you that I sing this song each morning</h3>\n<p>January 14th, 1969 (Twickenham Film Studios, London): Paul sings a song he’s written (or is simply improvising on the spot) in the spirit of Johannes Brahms’ ‘Hungarian Dance No. 4′ (and which was quite probably inspired by the 1947 film Song of Love, which features the piece).</p>\n<p>PAUL: It’s just for you that I sing this song of winter / It’s just for you that I sing a song of spring / And every time the raindrops fall I think of summer / It’s just for you that I sing a song of love.</p>\n<h3 id=\"disillusioned-by-the-church\">Disillusioned by the church</h3>\n<p>January 14th, 1969 (Twickenham Film Studios, London): While John and Yoko are being interviewed by CBC, a bored Paul decides to have a go at climbing the chain/rope equipment in the studio. Ringo and Mal do likewise. When John and Yoko return, Paul encourages John to have a go as well; John bemoans that he’s too old, and starts in on interviewing Paul and Ringo in a humorous imitation of the interview he just had. (Note: John and Yoko return at around the 8:05 mark, for those who’d prefer to skip all the banter and faffing about with equipment.)</p>\n<p>PAUL: Okay, John. Right up the chains, to the top.</p>\n<p>JOHN: Alright, Paul!</p>\n<p>PAUL: Come on, son, you can do it, son, I know you can do this, lad. [John attempts to climb]</p>\n<p>YOKO: John…</p>\n<p>PAUL: My money’s on him. [John presumably falls] See! [general sounds of sympathy and laughter]</p>\n<p>YOKO: [sweet] You’re not eighteen, you know.</p>\n<p>JOHN: No, no. [high-pitched voice] It’s alright. Don’t worry about a thing, Yoko.</p>\n<p>YOKO: He’s not that young anymore, you see. [laughs]</p>\n<p>JOHN: No, I’m not eighteen anymore. I couldn’t do it at bloody twelve, never mind… [Michael presumably helps out; to Michael] You’re so kind.</p>\n<p>MICHAEL: Yeah, I’m courteous. [inaudible]</p>\n<p>JOHN: [pause; formal voice] Now, we were going to discuss, this afternoon, what religion meant to a pop star. And the pop star we’ve chosen is Ringo McCartney. Tell me, McCartney, does religion mean much to you in this present day, with all the trends and the swinging miniskirts that are about? [Yoko laughs]</p>\n<p>PAUL: Fuck all! Fuck all.</p>\n<p>JOHN: Well, I can see that’s he’s been disillusioned by the church in general in his remark of “Fuck all.”</p>\n<p>PAUL: Yeah well I went to, uh, Brighton with the Maharishi. Fuck all it meant to me!</p>\n<p>JOHN: Was it an important step to you?</p>\n<p>PAUL: Nothing, nothing. He didn’t groove me.</p>\n<p>JOHN: He didn’t groove.</p>\n<p>PAUL: No.</p>\n<p>JOHN: He didn’t smoke pot, by any chance?</p>\n<p>PAUL: No.</p>\n<p>JOHN: What about the Reverend Nipples?</p>\n<p>PAUL: Not a chance.</p>\n<p>JOHN: Not a chance. [pause] Well, do you like “X”[-rated] films?</p>\n<p>PAUL: Yeah. Yeah. Lulu, Barry Ryan, and “X” films. But Maharishi – no.</p>\n<p>JOHN: That was a pretty concisive opinion of the youth of today. Now we’re going on to a rather different group, uh, generation gap, and that’s Tumble Starker! Who’s sitting here. Now, what do you think about mock-Tudor shithouses in Weybridge and places like that? [Yoko laughs]</p>\n<p>RINGO: [posh voice] Well, I don’t mind them being in Weybridge. It’s just when they try and put them in London, I think they get in the way of all the traffic.</p>\n<p>JOHN: Yes, you’re so right. As you said yesterday, “Neither your arse nor your elbow.”</p>\n<p>RINGO: [sage-like] I said that.</p>\n<p>JOHN: I couldn’t – I’d never forget it. Well that’s all for this evening.

Ringo casually suggests for John and Paul to write together again, just to fill the time. John (being John) answers in the form of a less-than-conspicuous ditty.</p>\n<p>RINGO: Yeah, why don’t you get together—</p>\n<p>PAUL: [facetious] Yeah, are you interested at all?</p>\n<p>RINGO: —and write a song?</p>\n<p>PAUL: [laughs] Really, yeah.</p>\n<p>JOHN: Actually, I’d say I started one last night. It goes something like this. You are definitely inclined towards it… Although sometimes I doubt it…</p>\n<p>YOKO: What are you joking about? [laughs]</p>\n<p>JOHN: Just… doing my new number.</p>\n<p>MAL: Is that the middle eight?</p>\n<p>JOHN: That’s the middle – I need a sort of chorus, and an outline. A format, to the, uh—</p>\n<p>PAUL: Common-garde. [general laughter]</p>\n<h3 id=\"whos-the-fool-on-the-hill-paul\">Who’s the fool on the hill, Paul?</h3>\n<p>January 14th, 1969 (Twickenham Film Studios, London): Hard pressed to work on any new material, the group (sans George, who is still out of the band) talk idly about producer Glyn Johns’ ancestry, the train sets an unrelated production company is preparing for a film inside the studio, and the plans for the next day’s sessions. John and Paul interview each other about their non-existent projects, skirt the issue of John’s health, and communicate in alternations of absurdity and obscurity. (In other words: John and Paul, in approximation of Beckett. Doug Sulpy describes the tone of John’s voice as having “an interesting quality […] as if, wanting to say something serious for a change, he’s forgotten quite how”.)</p>\n<p>JOHN: Who’s the fool on the hill, Paul?</p>\n<p>PAUL: John.</p>\n<p>JOHN: [long pause] I’m trying to sell the house. [long pause] When I was young, so much younger than today, I never needed anybody’s help, in any way. But now my life has changed in oh so many ways. A-whop-bop-a-luma… a-lim-bam-boom. [long pause] We should hold some sanctions against George. Very tightly.</p>\n<p>PAUL: Wheat. Coal.</p>\n<p>JOHN: Yes. Wheat and coal. Bread loaves. Meat biscuits. Cardboard cut-outs.</p>\n<p>PAUL: You see the Thirty-Minute Theatre?</p>\n<p>JOHN: I did, but in a blue fuzz. But it didn’t get through to me. Nice colour, though. [pause] I had a visit from a hippie family. Wondered why I had so many bedrooms.</p>\n<p>PAUL: [long pause] Were you able to tell them?</p>\n<p>JOHN: Oh, yeah. I told them I’ve got a lot of bedrooms because I’ve got too many. And I offered them accommodation in Ireland, which they took up.</p>\n<p>PAUL: [long pause] Let’s crack on. [sighs]</p>\n<p>MICHAEL: Who’s got a match, as opposed to a lighter?</p>\n<p>PAUL: I have.</p>\n<p>JOHN: I have.</p>\n<p>MICHAEL: As opposed to a lighter.</p>\n<p>RINGO: A wooden one?</p>\n<p>PAUL: Blue gold?</p>\n<p>MICHAEL: A wooden one do, a wooden one not do… thank you.</p>\n<p>PAUL: I wooden wanna…</p>\n<p>MICHAEL: Are you [inaudible] John?</p>\n<p>GLYN: [laughs] No, I am not related.</p>\n<p>RINGO: Stratford John?</p>\n<p>GLYN: Nope.</p>\n<p>PAUL: Farmer John?</p>\n<p>GLYN: Augustus John, apparently.</p>\n<p>MICHAEL: The John.</p>\n<p>GLYN: Rumour has it Augustus John is a grandfather twice removed or something. [laughs]</p>\n<p>MICHAEL: That’s the way with most of us offspring [inaudible].</p>\n<p>PAUL: [referring to the film equipment] Is that the new trick, the playback speed is up there?</p>\n<p>RINGO: They’ve been there for several years.</p>\n<p>PAUL: Still feeding back. [laughs]</p>\n<p>MICHAEL: Should we knock off early today or not?</p>\n<p>PAUL: Probably, yeah.</p>\n<p>MICHAEL: Should we knock on early tomorrow?</p>\n<p>JOHN: Yes, I’ll do that.</p>\n<p>PAUL: Knock on early?</p>\n<p>JOHN: Yes, I just uh… was up late, you know.</p>\n<p>PAUL: Yeah?</p>\n<p>MICHAEL: At the moment you’re a guest for lunch.</p>\n<p>JOHN: I was sort of stoned and high and watching films and I wouldn’t have made it anyway. And uh…</p>\n<p>PAUL: Check up.</p>\n<p>JOHN: [subdued] Yeah, but it’s not good if – I’m gonna come at ten, I should come at ten, you know.</p>\n<p>PAUL: Up with the dawn, down with the sun.</p>\n<p>JOHN: Mm.</p>\n<p>PAUL: Ringo ever, Eric never.</p>\n<p>YOKO: [referring to the previous night?] It was worthwhile, though, wasn’t it?</p>\n<p>JOHN: Oh, it was worthwhile. [Paul and Yoko laugh]</p>\n<p>PAUL: Does he make a lot of fun of you, Yoko?</p>\n<p>YOKO: Not enough. [laughs]</p>\n<p>PAUL: Not enough. [John laughs]</p>\n<p>MICHAEL: I think they’re painting the train. They’ll be doing that while – whilst the time we’re here.</p>\n<p>JOHN: We’d better get on before it leaves, then.</p>\n<p>PAUL: Please believe me. I’d hate to miss the train. Oh yeah. [pause] Like the shoes?</p>\n<p>YOKO: Is that the fashion?</p>\n<p>PAUL: This is the thing now, you know.</p>\n<p>YOKO: Mm.</p>\n<p>PAUL: The next thing. The socks are – the socks are with them, they come with them.</p>\n<p>JOHN: You did introduce oxford bogs, didn’t you? [Paul and Yoko laugh]</p>\n<p>PAUL: Yeah, yeah. I am an innovator in many ways.</p>\n<p>JOHN: Well, apart from your part-time work, what are you doing?</p>\n<p>PAUL: Well, I do a lot of dramatic work, in and out of the country.</p>\n<p>JOHN: Presently, I’m working on a Welsh TV series called Land for Wecken, in which I appear as a Danish singer of royal blood who turned to folk singing after a disaster in the First World War where the Nazis bombed his house.</p>\n<p>PAUL: Mm.</p>\n<p>JOHN: And he had to move into, uh, Norway I think it was. Why, I was born on the train between Ostograd and Fensborough.</p>\n<p>PAUL: Jamaica?</p>\n<p>JOHN: Sometimes. [Ringo laughs] But generally I have a hell of a mi-graine. So I usually take uh, frantic, which usually gets rid of it. It dissolves in half the time, you see. [pause] It gave me a great background for the job I’m doing now.</p>\n<p>MICHAEL: It’s funny – it’s funny, really. The guy said to me, do you mind if they store their trains quietly in the back? And they’ve come totally populated with painters and the rest of them.</p>\n<p>JOHN: Now, the one thing you find about – we’re not pushy.</p>\n<p>PAUL: No.</p>\n<p>JOHN: People want to put trains in the middle of our set—</p>\n<p>PAUL: —they get it.</p>\n<p>JOHN: [inaudible]</p>\n<p>PAUL: [pause] Yeah. Mind you, we’re not mugs.</p>\n<p>JOHN: Oh no.</p>\n<p>PAUL: Oh no.</p>\n<p>JOHN: [referring to Apple] We gave it all away. It was our plan.</p>\n<h3 id=\"all-this-camp-on-tv\">All this camp on TV</h3>\n<p>January 14th, 1969 (Twickenham Film Studios, London): With John, Paul and the others present seemingly loathe to rehearse or work on new material, John improvises a scene based on an earlier discussion about filming a Beatles detective thriller story in the studio. When director Michael Lindsay-Hogg expresses concern about how they should handle George’s walk-out in their proposed documentary of the sessions, John, whom along with Yoko, Paul, and Ringo has been speaking in non-sequiturs and idle thoughts for the past hour, suggests their current inhabitance of boredom would make a far more compelling film. As Yoko returns from making a phone call, John hooks onto the topic of Robert Baden Powell’s dissuasion of masturbation amongst the Boy Scouts.</p>\n<p>JOHN: Is Cilla Black? [Paul laughs] Read next week’s TV Times… and you’ll never know. [phone rings coincidentally in the studio] Ah! [Paul laughs; John pretends to hold a phone conversation] Sir Joseph. It’s about this deal with FBI. I need another million and the written acclimation of Dick James. [pause] I know it’s hard, I know it’s hard! But you’re in position to do it, George.</p>\n<p>MICHAEL: We were talking, earlier—</p>\n<p>JOHN: About the space between us?</p>\n<p>MICHAEL: [laughs] About the gap between us. But about also like the documentary, which is grinding to a halt. How we’d do it.</p>\n<p>JOHN: Grinding to a halt? I think it’s taking off.</p>\n<p>PAUL: [laughs] Taking— Here we go.</p>\n<p>JOHN: “Loop the loop,” as Frankie once said, the one-legged wonder.</p>\n<p>MICHAEL: Ringo said that he thought we ought to just tell it like it is, which is what I thought, but Mal thought we oughtn’t tell it like it is.</p>\n<p>PAUL: I think we are.</p>\n<p>MICHAEL: I think we are.</p>\n<p>JOHN: Well uh…</p>\n<p>MICHAEL: So those are the two camps, you might say, which goes back to the remark you were making earlier about Noël Coward.</p>\n<p>JOHN: [facetious] Well I do object to all this camp on TV, including Baden Powell on his foreskin. It’s one of the most upsetting things I’ve ever seen. Discouraging boys from masturbating in case he wets the sheets. [laughter] It’s funny you should say that. [Yoko returns]</p>\n<p>YOKO: What are you talking about?</p>\n<p>JOHN: I’m talking about the Boy Scouts who aren’t allowed to masturbate.</p>\n<p>YOKO: Oh.</p>\n<p>JOHN: It’s very tempting when you’re wearing shorts. If they only wore long trousers, maybe they’d stand a chance, you know. But I can tell you, you don’t go blind, but very short-sighted. [uproarious laughter]</p>\n<p>YOKO: Are you talking from experience, or just…?</p>\n<p>JOHN: From experience. [laughter] I remember during an English lesson, as I came, I suddenly noticed I needed glasses. I thought, “God, they were right.” But I’m not gonna give it up for anything! [Yoko laughs] All the tax I’ve earned. I should coco. [silence] We should dub on a spiritual message of that. [Paul and Yoko laugh]</p>\n<h3 id=\"no-business-like-no-business\">No business like no business</h3>\n<p>January 14th, 1969 (Twickenham Film Studios, London): As the day trudges forth without any productivity for the Beatles’ second day without George in the group, Paul asks John about Two Virgins (under the flippant guise of a journalist) to which John responds with stiff sincerity. As director Michael Lindsay-Hogg comes round to confer, Ringo admits that he isn’t feeling well and wonders about having some rest. Michael commiserates, but expresses concern about the impetus of the group and is worried that they will individually (and indifferently) wander off to their own devices if they don’t have a routine schedule to solder them together as a working band - which prompts John and Ringo to sing a sentimental folk bar. Not being of the disposition to have serious discussions about the direction of the (Get Back/Let It Be) sessions, John, Paul, and Ringo (dis)engage in frivolous wit and references to the Laugh-In.</p>\n<p>PAUL: So what’s the point behind Two Virgins? [Yoko laughs]</p>\n<p>JOHN: It’s a six-inch nail. [long pause] The main point behind it is to open people’s minds to what’s happening today. There are people all over the country humming into tape recorders, and we hope to bring them out into the open. And hum together. [pause] You understand?</p>\n<p>PAUL: Hmm.</p>\n<p>JOHN: Now sold one thousand three hundred due to the great promotion from Apple Dietetics.</p>\n<p>YOKO: [laughs] Which is a figure you don’t want to expose, necessarily.</p>\n<p>PAUL: Is it very neat to do this in public, Mr. Lennon?</p>\n<p>JOHN: I feel obliged, in the position that I am today as a pop idol and the power I have, to do something for the good, and uh, I feel obliged to speak out… [pause] And that’s as simple as I can put it, really. Take Downing Street. South Orderly Street. Wimpole Street. All owned by the Queen. ‘Nuff said. [silence; fidgeting]</p>\n<p>MAL: [in background] Is anybody – wanna rehearse, or do songs, or—?</p>\n<p>YOKO: [inaudible]</p>\n<p>RINGO: I feel ill, actually.</p>\n<p>MICHAEL: Do you? Was this a mistake [inaudible]?</p>\n<p>RINGO: I don’t. [laughter]</p>\n<p>JOHN: I think a few days in bed…</p>\n<p>RINGO: Yes, I think so too.</p>\n<p>JOHN: Or maybe three days on the couch, depending on what your job is.</p>\n<p>RINGO: I think two days in bed.</p>\n<p>MICHAEL: Do you really not feel well?</p>\n<p>RINGO: No, I just feel a bit… ill.</p>\n<p>PAUL: [to Michael] Well, do you?</p>\n<p>MICHAEL: I don’t feel well, but I can’t say, ‘cause I’m the captain of the ship.</p>\n<p>JOHN: Oh you can. [Yoko laughs]</p>\n<p>PAUL: Why?</p>\n<p>MICHAEL: No, I don’t want to let the crew down.</p>\n<p>JOHN: Nowadays, the captain gets off first.</p>\n<p>MICHAEL: No, I go down with the ship.</p>\n<p>YOKO: [inaudible]</p>\n<p>JOHN: No he does, really.</p>\n<p>MICHAEL: I feel tired, but I think it’s tiring – disappointing.</p>\n<p>JOHN: [bored] Hmm.</p>\n<p>MICHAEL: But I have a feeling if we decide not to meet one day, we may never meet again.</p>\n<p>PAUL: Well…</p>\n<p>JOHN: Along this dusty road…</p>\n<p>RINGO: We’ll always meet again…</p>\n<p>JOHN: On this dusty road.</p>\n<p>YOKO: As they say, there’s no business like no business.</p>\n<p>JOHN: Again.</p>\n<p>PAUL: Yeah.</p>\n<p>YOKO: Again.</p>\n<p>PAUL: And still the boom [mic] wasn’t over them.</p>\n<p>JOHN: Ooh, the Queen of Sheba wore falsies.</p>\n<p>RINGO: [mock-surprise] I didn’t know that!</p>\n<p>JOHN: Didn’t you know that? You weren’t there at the time. [pause] Cleopatra was a carpet manufacturer.</p>\n<p>RINGO: I didn’t know that!</p>\n<p>JOHN: ‘Cause you weren’t there at the time. [pause] Edgar Allen Poe was a shithouse.</p>\n<p>RINGO: I didn’t know that!</p>\n<p>YOKO: What was John Lennon?</p>\n<p>JOHN: A patriot. [Yoko laughs] I didn’t know that. [laughter]</p>\n<p>JOHN &#x26; PAUL: “Goodnight, Dick.” [laughter]</p>\n<p>JOHN: [sighs] That was Lennon and McCartney. Northern Sheds. Great Western Railway.</p>\n<p>PAUL: Songs for all functions.</p>\n<p>JOHN: Ross-Upon-Wye.</p>\n<p>PAUL: Nige-Whalley-Mange.</p>\n<p>JOHN: Ilford two, Western Middlodeons – terrible.</p>\n<h3 id=\"a-serious-program-of-work\">A serious program of work</h3>\n<p>January 14th, 1969 (Twickenham FIlm Studios, London): As Paul jokingly suggests for the (Let It Be documentary) camera crew to capture Ringo (who isn’t feeling well) if he sicks on the floor, John mentions superficially that he threw up during an interview filmed earlier in the day with Yoko for Canadian television - not from illness, but from recent irresponsible habits, possibly exercised the previous night. Paul, who is wearied by the lethargy of the proceedings, tries to engage John about the recording sessions and how they should work while George is gone, but John palters, and at turns they both fall back on oblique references and emotionally indeterminate allusions.</p>\n<p>After John trades bad jokes with Ringo, Paul implores them to remember why they’re here and that they can’t idle forever, and John (seemingly contrite, if nonetheless facile) agrees to start rehearsing. Despite the others’ reservations about his health, a subdued Ringo reassures that he’s staying to play too.</p>\n<p>RINGO: Kevin?</p>\n<p>PAUL: I think if we hang around a bit longer we can get Ringo being sick. [laughter]</p>\n<p>JOHN: You – see, you missed me this morning, I did it for CBS. Just leapt off in the middle of the interview.</p>\n<p>PAUL: Did you?</p>\n<p>KEVIN: [in background] As a matter of fact, yes.</p>\n<p>JOHN: No reason at all, except that I’ve been mistreating my body.</p>\n<p>YOKO: I thought it was a happening.</p>\n<p>JOHN: It was a happening.</p>\n<p>PAUL: There was a lot of nervous tension, you know.</p>\n<p>JOHN: Oh, yes.</p>\n<p>PAUL: I mean, there was a bloody funny atmosphere in that room, mother.</p>\n<p>JOHN: Aye.</p>\n<p>MICHAEL: We missed out on the other day.</p>\n<p>JOHN: Hmm?</p>\n<p>MICHAEL: We missed it the other day, but then they wouldn’t let us have it.</p>\n<p>JOHN: They missed it too.</p>\n<p>MICHAEL: Oh. Were they in colour or black and white?</p>\n<p>YOKO: Colour.</p>\n<p>JOHN: I never noticed that. Colour.</p>\n<p>PAUL: [trying] See, what we need is a serious program of work. An endeavour. Not an aimless rambling amongst the canyons of your mind. [inaudible] —life.</p>\n<p>JOHN: Take me on that trip upon that golden ship of shores… We’re all together, boy.</p>\n<p>PAUL: To wander aimlessly is very unswinging. Unhip.</p>\n<p>JOHN: And when I touch you, I feel happy inside. I can’t hide, I can’t hide. [pause] Ask me why, I’ll say I love you.</p>\n<p>PAUL: What we need is a schedule.</p>\n<p>JOHN: A garden schedule.</p>\n<p>PAUL: Point A to Z. Travel to A to Z, and having reached the point – take a holiday.</p>\n<p>JOHN: It’s holiday time.</p>\n<p>PAUL: Achieve something, everyday. [pause]</p>\n<p>YOKO: It’s a hell of a lot to ask for…</p>\n<p>JOHN: That’s sort of hard to live up to, Paul.</p>\n<p>PAUL: [very quiet] It’s very hard to live up to.</p>\n<p>MICHAEL: Ernest Hemingway had a very good remark about that, which I’ve unfortunately forgotten. About achieving something everyday. It’s the only thing of his writings I like.</p>\n<p>PAUL: It may in theory sound silly, but—</p>\n<p>JOHN: In practice…</p>\n<p>PAUL: —it’s even sillier. Well, if practice is all there is.</p>\n<p>JOHN: This is where it’s at.</p>\n<p>PAUL: This is where it’s at, unless that is where it’s at.</p>\n<p>JOHN: This is where it’s at, now.</p>\n<p>PAUL: Mm-hmm. [long pause] Teamwork. A good defense. And a line of forwards. A good strong pair of boots.</p>\n<p>YOKO: [inaudible]</p>\n<p>JOHN: You play ball with me, and I’ll play ball with you.</p>\n<p>PAUL: Don’t swing the lead, sonny.</p>\n<p>JOHN: Every cloud have a silver mouth boat.</p>\n<p>PAUL: Could be learning something instead of this, you know.</p>\n<p>JOHN: Bob Newridges is a tartan that covers Yorkshire.</p>\n<p>PAUL: Rutland is the smallest county.</p>\n<p>JOHN: Scarborough is a college scarf.</p>\n<p>PAUL: Amo amas a minge.</p>\n<p>JOHN: [laughs] Amanty meaty monkey monk… [Paul laughs]</p>\n<p>YOKO: [to Michael] Are we going to see the rushes, or—?</p>\n<p>PAUL: This is the – this is the typical end-product of an actor’s career.</p>\n<p>JOHN: Alexander the Great was a bighead. Or a fireplace. [long pause] Why do they call it Great Britain? How long is it going to go on? Fantastic France. Amazing America.</p>\n<p>PAUL: Huge Spain.</p>\n<p>JOHN: [laughs] Huge Spain. I’ll drink to that. [pause] When is a door not a door?</p>\n<p>RINGO: I don’t know.</p>\n<p>JOHN: When it’s ajar.</p>\n<p>PAUL: When it’s ajar.</p>\n<p>RINGO: Two flies on a door. Which one was sick?</p>\n<p>JOHN: I don’t know.</p>\n<p>RINGO: The one on the panel.</p>\n<p>JOHN: I don’t blame it.

Because our hearts are—</p>\n<p>JOHN: Should we go play our group, then?</p>\n<p>PAUL: There’s the other point.</p>\n<p>JOHN: I think this is rather good.</p>\n<p>PAUL: It’s alright, I must say, but we can’t carry on like this indefinitely.</p>\n<p>JOHN: As some clips in between.</p>\n<p>PAUL: Yeah.</p>\n<p>JOHN: [pause] As I said, I’m just recovering from the day, you know…</p>\n<p>PAUL: Dyspepsia.</p>\n<p>YOKO: From the night, frankly.</p>\n<p>JOHN: [stage whisper] Oh, don’t say that, you’re be revealings!</p>\n<p>YOKO: [laughs] Oh… I didn’t think about that.</p>\n<p>JOHN: “From the night”, indeed. Next thing you’ll be telling them about our black sheets! [laughter] Enriched with Marylebone Station… [fidgeting; gets up] Right. [to Paul] Guitars? I thought that’s what they do.</p>\n<p>PAUL: That is what they do, but if you’re singing—</p>\n<p>JOHN: Oh, I’ll even sing you half a song I was writing.</p>\n<p>PAUL: [gets up; to Ringo] C’mon. Sounds. How’s – how’s about?</p>\n<p>RINGO: [subdued] Sound city… Yes, go on, I’ll come.</p>\n<p>PAUL: [concerned] How are you feeling?</p>\n<p>RINGO: No, I just feel a bit off. Very—</p>\n<p>PAUL: [joking; bleak] Last two years, actually.</p>\n<p>RINGO: [laughs] No, it’s not that. It’s just that some days— [inaudible; drowned out by voice marking slate] —you don’t know how you feel.</p>\n<p>(Note: Kevin Harrington is one of the production runners in the studio. The phrase “canyons of your mind” is in reference to the song by The Bonzo Dog Doo Dah Band. Doug Sulpy describes John and Paul’s exchange in part as “a duel of witticisms”.</p>\n<p>During this period of time John was using heroin, which is the most probable cause - directly or indirectly - for his vomiting.)</p>\n<h2 id=\"121\">1/21</h2>\n<h3 id=\"in-the-middle-of-an-island--gilly-gilly-ossenfeffer-katzenellen-bogen-by-the-sea\">‘In The Middle Of An Island’ / ‘Gilly, Gilly, Ossenfeffer, Katzenellen Bogen by the Sea’</h3>\n<p>January 21st, 1969 (Apple Studios, London): A singing of the 1957 song ‘In The Middle Of An Island’ segues naturally into ‘Gilly, Gilly, Ossenfeffer, Katzenellen Bogen by the Sea’.</p>\n<h3 id=\"too-bad-about-sorrows-too-bad-about-love\">Too bad about sorrows, too bad about love</h3>\n<p>January 21st, 1969 (Apple Studios, London): Paul leads the band into a lively rendition of Ronnie Hawkins’ ‘Forty Days’ (itself a variant of Chuck Berry’s ‘Thirty Days’). John and Paul exchange some nascent wordplay on the Rolling Stone journalist Al Aronowitz and then break into an old Lennon-McCartney composition.</p>\n<p>JOHN: Another Lennon-McCartney original entitled ‘All I Want Is You’.</p>\n<p>PAUL: Al a one a two. Al Aronowitz. Al Aronowitz.</p>\n<p>JOHN: Al Aronowitz if you’ll Aronowitz. We’ll both Aronowitz together.</p>\n<p>PAUL: Too bad about sorrows / Too bad about love…</p>\n<p>JOHN &#x26; PAUL: There’ll be no tomorrow…</p>\n<p>JOHN: For all of your love…</p>\n<p>PAUL: You said you were sleeping / But I can’t forget / The trouble you’re leaving…</p>\n<h3 id=\"shag-everybody-shag-now\">Shag! Everybody shag now!</h3>\n<p>January 21st, 1969 (Apple Studios, London): John and Paul sing brief racy takes of ‘You’re Gonna Lose That Girl’ and ‘Shout!’.</p>\n<p>JOHN: You’re gonna shag that girl… Shag!

Everybody shag!</p>\n<p>PAUL: A little bit harder now, a little bit softer now…</p>\n<h3 id=\"william-street-boogie\">‘William Street Boogie’</h3>\n<p>January 21st, 1969 (Apple Studios, London): Paul gurgles ludicrously throughout a blues boogie with entirely improvised lyrics.</p>\n<h2 id=\"122\">1/22</h2>\n<h3 id=\"for-the-sake-of-the-boy-you-once-knew\">For the sake of the boy you once knew</h3>\n<p>January 22nd, 1969 (Apple Studios, London): After John tells Yoko, Paul, and George about having received a letter from Millie Sutcliffe requesting his financial support, George reads aloud from the letter while John expresses his derision for Mrs. Sutcliffe’s justification of responsibility - his old friendship with Stuart - and points out that Stuart didn’t even have much regard for her.</p>\n<p>GEORGE: Well, what’s Mrs. Sutcliffe want?</p>\n<p>JOHN: Well, what they all want – money.</p>\n<p>GEORGE: [reading] “This is the last cry for help. My bank is now to the wall—” [laughs] My “back”.</p>\n<p>JOHN: “Back”, “bank”. [George laughs] I thought it was “bank” too.</p>\n<p>GEORGE: “—as it’s been many times before, but this is the last time.

(Note: The song Ringo will work on over the next few days is, of course, ‘Octopus’s Garden’.)</p>\n<p>MICHAEL: Are you going to sing [your own song on this record]?</p>\n<p>RINGO: Um, more than likely I’ll get one later on.</p>\n<p>MICHAEL: Good.</p>\n<p>JOHN: Didn’t George write you one too?</p>\n<p>RINGO: George has written one for both of us.</p>\n<p>JOHN: You’re both in it?</p>\n<p>RINGO: Yeah.

[laughs] Oh come on, Ringo, you really know how to swing! One of those.</p>\n<h3 id=\"we-could-make-it-our-last-single\">We could make it our last single</h3>\n<p>January 22nd, 1969 (Apple Studios, London): As the band works on ‘I’ve Got A Feeling’, an earlier conversation about Martin Luther King Jr. inspires Paul to improvise a line. John suggests they have a song about dreams as their last single. (Note: John could be thinking of Johnnie Taylor’s ‘I Had A Dream’ or Ray Charles’ ‘I Had A Dream’.)</p>\n<p>PAUL: All that I’ve been looking for was somebody who looks like you / I had a dream this afternoon!</p>\n<p>JOHN: I think somebody’s written it, actually.</p>\n<p>PAUL: Oh.</p>\n<p>JOHN: I have a feeling some spade wrote one called ‘I Had A Dream’.</p>\n<p>PAUL: Oh, yeah. [pause] I have a dream…</p>\n<p>JOHN: We could make it our last single.</p>\n<h3 id=\"very-phallic\">Very phallic</h3>\n<p>January 23rd, 1969 (Apple Studios, London): Gallery owner Robert Fraser drops in on the sessions to find the lights in the studio blown out after a circuit overload. Yoko asks Robert (who hosted John and Yoko’s You Are Here art show) whether he’s already seen John and Yoko’s short films, and Robert enquires about the anvil in the room (which is being used for ‘Maxwell’s Silver Hammer’) which John makes fun of, comparing it to a conceptual art piece. Paul, who has been playing the piano, chats with Robert about the song.</p>\n<p>PAUL: We’re having a bit of trouble. [laughs]</p>\n<p>ROBERT: Oh no.</p>\n<p>JOHN: Not one emergency light in all of them!</p>\n<p>ROBERT: You should have a candle. Or I’ll give you a candle. Is that piece of anvil from [inaudible]?</p>\n<p>JOHN: Yes, it’s a Henry Moore we had brought in.</p>\n<p>ROBERT: Yeah.</p>\n<p>JOHN: Henry Moore’s anvil.</p>\n<p>ROBERT: Very phallic. [pause]</p>\n<p>PAUL: [laughs] It’s just a reminder. To remind you about ‘Maxwell’s Silver Hammer’ all the time. An anvil that will never be removed. Bang bang Maxwell’s silver hammer…</p>\n<p>ROBERT: Was this, um, a blacksmith’s place, before? [Paul laughs] In the basement?</p>\n<p>PAUL: This is Mal’s instrument. For a song called ‘Maxwell’s Silver Hammer’.</p>\n<p>ROBERT: Oh I see, yeah.</p>\n<p>PAUL: When Mal hits it. “Bang bang, Maxwell’s silver hammer.”</p>\n<p>ROBERT: Why did you decide it had to be an anvil?</p>\n<p>PAUL: It was just that – you see, it was just that sound that came to me one day. A silver hammer on an anvil.</p>\n<p>ROBERT: Yeah. Very refined. Really terrific.</p>\n<h2 id=\"124\">1/24</h2>\n<h3 id=\"were-a-couple-of-queens\">We’re a couple of queens</h3>\n<p>January 24th, 1969: As John and Paul discuss their vocal arrangement for ‘Two Of Us’, John wryly points out the queerness in having them share lead vocals on a love song. Paul, undeterred, suggests the male-female singing duo Paul and Paula step in for them as a replacement.</p>\n<p>PAUL: Okay, “two of us riding nowhere,” that’s as if – [that’s] said we’re like – two, but then “we’re on our way home—”</p>\n<p>JOHN: It’s like we’re like a couple of queens.</p>\n<p>PAUL: Yeah. Well, you know. Well, I mean, that’s—</p>\n<p>JOHN: We’re a couple of queens…</p>\n<p>PAUL: [American accent] That’s just too bad. Unless you want to get Paul and Paula in. [pause] Poetic license, John.</p>\n<p>JOHN: [American accent] You’re telling me, Paul.</p>\n<h3 id=\"its-like-you-and-me-are-lovers\">It’s like you and me are lovers</h3>\n<p>January 24th, 1969: After John and Paul run through another take of ‘Two Of Us’, Paul comments on the narratives and discreet emotional correlation between their songs.</p>\n<p>PAUL: It’s like, uh, “We have to get back.” “We’re on our way home.”</p>\n<p>JOHN: Yeah.</p>\n<p>PAUL: There’s a story. There’s another one – ‘Don’t Let Me Down’. “Oh darling, I’ll never let you down.” Like we’re doing—</p>\n<p>JOHN: Yeah. It’s like you and me are lovers.</p>\n<p>PAUL: [reserved] Yeah. [pause]</p>\n<p>JOHN: We’ll just have to camp it up for those two.</p>\n<p>PAUL: Yeah. Well, I’ll be wearing my skirt for the show, anyway.</p>\n<h3 id=\"balls-to-your-partner-arses-to-the-wall\">Balls to your partner, arses to the wall</h3>\n<p>January 24th, 1969 (Apple Studios, London): Paul briefly breaks into a curious ditty during a lull between takes. (Note: Mr. Bengelstein, I presume?)</p>\n<p>PAUL: Balls to your partner / Arses to the wall…</p>\n<h3 id=\"boiled-testicle\">Boiled testicle</h3>\n<p>January 24th, 1969: John and Paul play through an old Lennon-McCartney song called ‘I Fancy Me Chances’, amuse themselves with their lunch orders, and ponder the etymological origins of “brer”. Paul then talks to himself about being a carpenter.</p>\n<p>JOHN: Crepe corbett.</p>\n<p>PAUL: Broccoli hors d’oeuvre.</p>\n<p>JOHN: Sparrow on toast.</p>\n<p>PAUL: … Boiled testicle.</p>\n<h3 id=\"you-pretend-to-be-in-with-the-in-crowd\">You pretend to be in with the in crowd</h3>\n<p>January 24th, 1969 (Apple Studio): During a break in the Let It Be sessions, Paul makes up a song about his (less famous) dog, Eddie. To John’s amusement and eventual participation, it turns into an extended ode to Beatles pets. (Note: Mentioned are Ringo’s dog Tiger, John’s dog Bernard, John’s late dog Nigel, and John’s cat Mimi. John’s poem Good Dog Nigel recounts his unfortunate demise - at the hands of Aunt Mimi.)</p>\n<p>JOHN: [laughs] You have to sing it “There you go, Bernard”. ’Cause he was given away.</p>\n<p>JOHN &#x26; PAUL: [singing] There you go, Bernard, Bernard, Bernard… I’m so sad to see you go, Bernard, Bernard you dog.</p>\n<h2 id=\"125\">1/25</h2>\n<h3 id=\"after-this-is-all-over-youll-be-off-in-a-black-bag-somewhere\">After this is all over, you’ll be off in a black bag somewhere</h3>\n<p>January 25th, 1969 (Apple Studios, London): After a protracted discussion about the prospective production value of (what will eventually be) the Let It Be documentary, George tries to allay Paul’s underlying (overriding) concerns about the still-unstructured production and tells him that the group’s best efforts have tended to be spontaneous anyway, and John points out that Paul’s retainment of his original intentions for this project, in spite of its changes over the past three weeks, is what is causing him anxiety. Paul responds in a possible intimation of his own investment in the band in comparison to John’s, and John, in possible acknowledgment of it, contends that he would dig playing onstage as The Beatles again, if not for the inertia they would inevitably labour under as a touring group.</p>\n<p>As Paul bleakly compares their present monotony in the studio precisely to the monotony they felt while on tour performing the same songs over and over again night after night, George reasons (not unkindly) that it’s an emotional cycle that everyone goes through, no matter the state of affairs they’re in, and in this case, feels the familiarity of Apple Studios (attendant film crew non-withstanding) would be better for the group’s musical finesse than having to involve themselves with the hassle of touring again. Paul, however, remains uncertain of his own feelings and wonders aloud about why he feels them at all. Producer Glyn Johns, who has been listening in, sincerely vouches for the buoyant studio atmosphere and heartening improvement the band has made in the past couple of days, and Yoko, likewise, encourages Paul to ride on the upswing and not tie himself down with the variables.</p>\n<p>GEORGE: The things that’ve worked out best ever for us haven’t really been planned any more than this has. It’s just, you know, it’s like you just go into something and then it does it itself, you know. Whatever it’s gonna be, it becomes that, you know.</p>\n<p>JOHN: See, it’s turned out – that, for that, but it’s not what Paul wants. Like, you know, it was – it’s like if – say it’s his number, this whole show. Well it’s turned – it’s a compromise. So now it’s actually turned into our number more than his number. That’s all.</p>\n<p>PAUL: Yeah, and that’s—</p>\n<p>JOHN: And uh—</p>\n<p>PAUL: —and that’s alright, you know. It’s—</p>\n<p>JOHN: It’s alright, but I mean that’s what’s bugging you, really. Because it’s a different number, you know. It’s turned into a rock number as opposed to a choir number or something, you know, like that. And uh… [quiet] it’s just that, really. [silence]</p>\n<p>PAUL:</p>\n<p>But it’s just funny to sort of realise that after this is all over, you’ll be off in a black bag somewhere – on the Albert Hall, you know.</p>\n<p>JOHN: Yes.</p>\n<p>PAUL: And sort of doing shows and stuff, and you know, digging—</p>\n<p>JOHN: Yeah, but I—</p>\n<p>PAUL: —digging that thing of it.</p>\n<p>JOHN: But I don’t – I would dig to play on stage, you know.</p>\n<p>PAUL: Yeah.</p>\n<p>JOHN: I mean, if it was – if everything was alright and there was no messing, and we were just going to play onstage… you know.</p>\n<p>PAUL: Yeah. But it’s only that. It’s only that. I’d like to see Ringo and us – [inaudible] you know, and all that. But I mean—</p>\n<p>JOHN: That’s why I said yes to the TV show. I didn’t want the – the hell of doing it.</p>\n<p>PAUL: —and I’d like that. I’d like that, see, so that’s—</p>\n<p>JOHN: Well, I like playing – ‘cause that’s why I went on the Stones show [Rock and Roll Circus], you know?</p>\n<p>PAUL: Mm.</p>\n<p>JOHN: [faltering] And that’s why I’ll – I’ll do – things, but I mean if – if we all don’t want to do that…</p>\n<p>PAUL: [reserved] Yeah, I know, it is that. It’s like the majority decision to – yeah.</p>\n<p>JOHN: [wary] But I don’t want to sort of, uh, go on the road again. [silence; guitar playing]</p>\n<p>PAUL: Yeah. I just feel as though we are on the road again. I mean, we are, but we’re in the studio. Like, and we just keep to the same environment, totally. Always. We don’t ever attempt to break out of that.</p>\n<p>JOHN: Well, we did, though! We did.</p>\n<p>PAUL: And that’s – you know. So I mean—</p>\n<p>GEORGE: Yeah. It’s just, you break out of one into another and then you want to break out of that.</p>\n<p>PAUL: Yeah, but I mean – you know.</p>\n<p>YOKO: Maybe next week—</p>\n<p>PAUL: [preoccupied] It is like the reason it’s nice to live on the country, you know. Just because it’s nice out there. It’s nice in a warm environment, you know.</p>\n<p>YOKO: [to Paul referring to the other Beatles?] Maybe next week they might change their minds, though.</p>\n<p>JOHN: [to Yoko] [inaudible]</p>\n<p>GEORGE: In my opinion this is the nicest place I’ve been for a long time, this studio.</p>\n<p>PAUL: Yeah, it is.</p>\n<p>GEORGE: No, really, you know. I mean, and also we’ve played – this is the most I’ve ever played, by playing everyday. And I can just, you know, feel myself getting – me fingers getting loose, a bit. Because we don’t get a chance for that. But if we go out on the road, then – or whatever – it falls, it gets back into that one. But really I just want to play, and you can play better without having to, you know, do all those things.</p>\n<p>PAUL: [preoccupied] Yeah.</p>\n<p>GEORGE: I mean, it’s not so bad now – but it is, really, it would be easier to play without all these mics and without all the cameras and things like that. But uh…</p>\n<p>PAUL: Yeah, it’s alright. [silence; George starts playing Bob Dylan’s ‘All I Really Want To Do’]</p>\n<p>…</p>\n<p>PAUL: I don’t know what it is, you know, that I’m moaning about, but it’s just sort of—</p>\n<p>GLYN: I must admit, I can’t really see it like – [laughs; optimistic] because it’s – it’s just seeing the last two days, everything’s gone so ridiculously well.</p>\n<p>PAUL: It is, it’s going great, really good.</p>\n<p>YOKO: It’s going great.</p>\n<p>GLYN: We still need—</p>\n<p>YOKO: [to Paul; encouraging] And maybe next week it might change, you don’t know.</p>\n<p>PAUL: Yeah, sure, I mean…</p>\n<p>YOKO: I mean, it might be great… and everyone might feel like going outside, you know.</p>\n<p>PAUL: Mm.</p>\n<h3 id=\"i-lost-my-little-girl\">‘I Lost My Little Girl’</h3>\n<p>January 25th, 1969 (Apple Studios, London): Uninterested in discussing the technical vagaries of the Get Back/Let It Be production with Paul and Michael-Lindsay Hogg any longer, John starts to riff on Paul’s very first composition, ‘I Lost My Little Girl’. Everyone else in the group eventually joins in to jam. (Note: John actually starts singing the song about three minutes prior to the start of this clip, when Paul is still in discussion with Michael Lindsay-Hogg. So, he’s been going on for a while.)</p>\n<h3 id=\"eins-zwei-drei-vier-you-and-i-have-memories\">Eins zwei drei vier! You and I have memories</h3>\n<p>January 25th, 1969: John and Paul amuse themselves with ‘Two Of Us’, singing it in German accents, Scottish accents, Jamaican accents, and… whatever else besides.</p>\n<h3 id=\"ill-have-you-banned-from-bloody-apple\">I’ll have you banned from bloody Apple</h3>\n<p>January 25th, 1969 (Apple Studios, London): As the band starts to meander after several imperfect and increasingly unserious rehearsals of ‘Let It Be’ (including a stray comment from Paul that prompts John and George to break into Chuck Berry’s ‘I’m Talking About You’), Paul tries to steer them back to a serious run-through. John protests in jest and, perhaps reminded of the Beatles’ improvised Christmas records, starts thanking the fans for all of the gifts they’ve sent. The next rehearsal of ‘Let It Be’ is foiled again by Paul and Ringo, however, enabling John to get into a mock-tirade about not even reaching the part of the song where he comes in (to the amusement of the group).</p>\n<p>PAUL: Come on now, come on now, come on now. Come on now – back to the drudgery.</p>\n<p>JOHN: [mock-outrage] It’s you that’s making it like this, it’s you that’s bloody making it like—</p>\n<p>PAUL: The real meaning of Christmas. [starts playing ‘Let It Be’]</p>\n<p>JOHN: I’d especially like to thank you for all the birthday presents…</p>\n<p>…</p>\n<p>PAUL: There will be an answer, let it be… [falters; laughs] Then, is it—</p>\n<p>JOHN: Ah!</p>\n<p>PAUL: Ah.</p>\n<p>JOHN: You shook me. [to Ringo] You stuck in another verse there, Richard.</p>\n<p>PAUL: Yeah. You send me.</p>\n<p>RINGO: What?</p>\n<p>JOHN: He’s got another verse in there, now. You come in with the flugle.</p>\n<p>RINGO: Alright, John!</p>\n<p>PAUL: [laughs] You only have to pick your nose and a camera and a boom is over there…</p>\n<p>JOHN: Okay, this is your last chance.</p>\n<p>PAUL: Now look boys, now come on. Enthuse a little.</p>\n<p>JOHN: [mock-outrage] I can’t, I don’t even get up to my bit, you keep finishing! [everyone laughs] Shut up, will ya, or I’ll have you banned from bloody Apple if you don’t shut up! [Paul laughs; John subdues himself] Okay, “Let it be…” is where I come in… [laughter]</p>\n<h2 id=\"126\">1/26</h2>\n<h3 id=\"did-you-dream-about-me-last-night\">Did you dream about me last night?</h3>\n<p>January 26th, 1969: Paul arrives at the studio accompanied by Linda and Heather just as George and Ringo are working out the melody for ‘Octopus’s Garden’ on the piano. John, who has been playing around on drums, chimes in none too discreetly with a question he’s been eager to ask Paul.</p>\n<p>JOHN: Hey! Did you dream about me last night?</p>\n<p>PAUL: [long pause] I can’t remember.</p>\n<p>JOHN: Very strong dream. We both dreamt about it. It was amazing! Different dreams, you know, but I thought you must’ve been there. [inaudible] I was touching you. [inaudible]</p>\n<p>PAUL: Nothing to worry about, though?</p>\n<p>JOHN: Nothing to worry about, no.</p>\n<h3 id=\"octopuses-pick-up-all-the-seashells\">Octopuses pick up all the seashells</h3>\n<p>January 26th, 1969 (Apple Studios, London): As the Beatles work on the arrangement for Octopus’s Garden’, Ringo tells Paul about the basis for the song, piquing George’s memory of what he was once told about octopuses. (Note: John’s on drums. This clip from the sessions is shortly followed by Heather sharing her personal octopus anecdote with John - which I can’t make out, unfortunately - and more animal banter.)</p>\n<p>GEORGE: Hey, it was somebody – he was telling me octopuses go and pick up all the seashells. You know about that?</p>\n<p>RINGO: Yes, that’s why I wrote it! ‘Cause the guides told me [about them] on the boat in Sardinia. [inaudible]</p>\n<p>GEORGE: Yeah. [to Paul] You know about that? They collect all nice-looking things and make a garden around where they are and just with all their groovy things to sleep behind.</p>\n<p>RINGO: Yeah.</p>\n<p>GEORGE: [laughs] It’s great.</p>\n<h3 id=\"you-dont-eat-any-cats\">You don’t eat any cats</h3>\n<p>January 26th, 1969 (Apple Studio): While Paul, George, and Ringo work on the arrangement for ‘Octopus’s Garden’, John teases Paul and Linda’s daughter Heather about her new pets.</p>\n<p>HEATHER: We’ve got some baby kittens only about that big—</p>\n<p>JOHN: Are you going to eat them?</p>\n<p>HEATHER: No!</p>\n<p>JOHN: Lots of people do, you know. I don’t, I mean.</p>\n<p>HEATHER: Kittens that have just been born yesterday, or a few days—</p>\n<p>PAUL: On toast? On toast?</p>\n<p>JOHN: You put pastry around them, and then you have cat pie.</p>\n<p>HEATHER: A few days they were just born, weren’t they?</p>\n<p>JOHN: Oh, you’d better wait a week or two before you eat them.</p>\n<p>HEATHER: No, I’m never going to eat them!</p>\n<p>JOHN: Aren’t you? Well, that’s very good.</p>\n<p>HEATHER: And then we took the grown-ups, and one of them’s beautiful, like this Daddy cat. It’s got a big black spot there—</p>\n<p>JOHN: Oh, you don’t eat them if they have black spots.</p>\n<p>HEATHER: The other one’s like a tiger.</p>\n<p>JOHN: You don’t eat them if they’re like tigers, either. [laughter]</p>\n<p>HEATHER: You don’t eat any cats! They don’t taste good. [general laughter] And anyway, I’m just a pussycat who was just born.</p>\n<p>JOHN: Are you?</p>\n<p>PAUL: Okay, pussycat.</p>\n<p>JOHN: There’s a good dog. Puss.</p>\n<p>…</p>\n<p>HEATHER: Stop keep – stop keep calling me “dog”, I’m a cat.</p>\n<p>JOHN: Okay, cat.</p>\n<h3 id=\"cat-food-tins-are-too-small\">Cat food tins are too small</h3>\n<p>January 26th, 1969: While listening to a playback of ‘For You Blue’, Paul and Linda’s daughter Heather tells everyone about her pet kittens, and starts a discussion amongst John, Yoko, Paul, Linda, and George about their cat food preferences.</p>\n<p>HEATHER: Then the other kittens will have other kittens, then the other kittens - listen, Paul! - then you know, the other babies will have other babies and the other babies will have other babies, and the other babies will have other babies… and then some will have to be in our room, and in your room, and in everybody’s room! And then it’ll be too much.</p>\n<p>…</p>\n<p>JOHN: And they always make cat food tins too small.</p>\n<p>…</p>\n<p>JOHN: [laughs] I give them ping pong balls. [Heather roars]</p>\n<h3 id=\"is-that-food-cooking\">Is that food? Cooking?</h3>\n<p>January 26th, 1969 (Apple Studios, London): After a couple dozen takes of ‘Let It Be’, John and George betray their restlessness and hunger, while Paul suggests a couple more takes before they take a break. John and Paul converse in mock-German.</p>\n<p>JOHN: Should we do it once more and have dinner? It must be our dinner cooking, nobody else lives here.</p>\n<p>GEORGE: Is that food? Cooking?</p>\n<h2 id=\"127\">1/27</h2>\n<h3 id=\"how-much-does-he-love-yoko\">How much does he love Yoko?</h3>\n<p>January 27th, 1969 (Apple Studios, London): Over breakfast, John shows Paul a book he’s had compiled of the various press articles covering John and Yoko’s You Are Here art show. Paul reads aloud from some of the articles to the amusement of John and Yoko.</p>\n<p>PAUL: “Beatle John Lennon hugged actress Yoko Ono last night and said, ‘My marriage is over. I am in love with Yoko. Of course my wife and I are not through legally—’”</p>\n<p>JOHN: That they put “actress” is great.</p>\n<p>YOKO: [laughs] No, they thought I performed in the Bottoms film. [laughter] They took it so seriously…</p>\n<p>JOHN: Said it seriously.</p>\n<p>PAUL: “How much does he love Yoko? ‘Much more than I love the Queen.’” [laughter; Paul hums]</p>\n<p>JOHN:</p>\n<p>The layout of the book’s really good though, the way he’s done it.</p>\n<p>PAUL: This – is this the layout?</p>\n<p>JOHN: No, this is just the bit – that bit, you know. Because he’s gonna have that folding out of the book, sheets, like, because – to get them all together. But it’s just, you know. The packaging is great.</p>\n<p>PAUL: It’s good, yeah. Great. [inaudible; continues reading articles aloud]</p>\n<p>?: What else is there?</p>\n<p>JOHN: There’s hundreds of things, you know, this is just the press part of it. There’s all the letters I got, and the photos of the exhibition, and – yeah.</p>\n<p>?: Oh, just this topic.</p>\n<p>JOHN: Yeah. The whole You Are Here book, you know. Book of the film of the video.</p>\n<p>?: And the policeman. Is that included in the film? The statement—</p>\n<p>JOHN: No, no. This is just – just that one day. Reaction to one day.</p>\n<p>YOKO: It’s amazing, isn’t it? Just for that one day.</p>\n<p>PAUL: Yes.</p>\n<p>JOHN: But it’s just great you know, it’s sort of like what we’re doing now. We’re doing a show, and then you bring in a book of the show—</p>\n<p>PAUL: Yeah.</p>\n<p>?: Who’s doing it?</p>\n<p>JOHN: Uh, publishing it?</p>\n<p>?: Yeah.</p>\n<p>JOHN: Cape. That’s what I think—</p>\n<p>YOKO: That’s what – I think that’s where we’re going with, Cape.</p>\n<p>JOHN: Yeah, I’m gonna go to Cape.</p>\n<p>PAUL: Is there a next book that you’ll be expecting?</p>\n<p>JOHN: Yeah, but I owe it [inaudible] in the contract.</p>\n<p>PAUL: Oh, indeed. Great.</p>\n<p>JOHN: So they’ll have to pay for it, and it’s expensive. The other one’s cost nothing to do.</p>\n<p>?: Who does this for you?</p>\n<p>YOKO: Oh, the [inaudible] or something.</p>\n<p>?: Oh, you have a [clipping] service, do you? Yeah, great.</p>\n<h3 id=\"you-cant-book-me-for-that-constable\">You can’t book me for that, Constable</h3>\n<p>January 27th, 1969 (Apple Studios, London): As producer Glyn Johns grouses about having been apprehended by the police on a petty driving charge (and causing him to be late to arrive in the studio), Paul commiserates and humorously shares his own peeved exchanges with policemen on the road.</p>\n<p>PAUL: Let me take you down, ‘cause I’m going to…</p>\n<p>GLYN: Can you believe that bleeding copper! [stuffy voice] “Oh, alright, I’ll have to report this, you know, anything you say will be taken down,” and it went through all that!</p>\n<p>JOHN: Have you got a fag?</p>\n<p>GLYN: Yeah.</p>\n<p>PAUL: I had a terrible scene the other day on the motorway with a copper. ‘Cause they stopped me, and I – I don’t like it, getting stopped by police. I always get – I get obnoxious with them, you know. [Yoko laughs] ‘Cause I’ll just sort of check around to see if I’m in the right, and once I know I am, and they’ve stopped me, I get very… But they just stopped me because I was hogging the outside lane, and you’re not supposed to do that. So he said, “You did, you know.” You’re going seventy. You’ve got to stay out there, but you’re not supposed to get back in. So he stopped me, and then it really got sort of nasty after a bit. ‘Cause Linda just had her hand round the back of my head, and then he said, “You can’t possibly be in – in control!”</p>\n<p>YOKO: [laughs] Oh, no.</p>\n<p>PAUL: “You see how that young lady was fondling the back of your neck…” [uproarious laughter] And I said, “Oh, what’s up with you, then? Don’t you get it?” [laughter] You know, and it got really like that. “Oh! You can’t book me for that, Constable!” You know, it got really sort of… “Oh, can’t I!” [laughter] And of course, my tax. [laughs] They got me. My tax wasn’t up to date and all.</p>\n<p>JOHN:</p>\n<p>Don’t they just do it at the office for us?</p>\n<p>PAUL: No.</p>\n<p>JOHN: Oh. I probably haven’t had one done since I started, then. [laughter]</p>\n<p>PAUL: They keep doing that. I was going through Mersey Tunnel, and they keep stopping me in the Mersey Tunnel ‘cause they see you and they just want an autograph. So I sort of thought, “Right, this time, they’re not going to stop me.” And a fella comes up, and I just – all the way through the tunnel, I did thirty. Just saw him in the mirror all the time. I thought, “You… you’re going to stop me at the end and ask me for an autograph.”</p>\n<p>So he just sort of drives in front of me waves me down, so I’m just — ah! [laughter] – crash in with him and say, “No, no, I have no time, no time!” And he just… [grumbling] So he stopped me and said, “… Your tax.” [laughter] Yeah. I can’t stand that, I really go sort of funny with police. You know, police [inaudible] when nothing’s been done, fighting against them before they’ve got me for anything. I don’t like it.</p>\n<h3 id=\"happy-and-a-rocker\">Happy and a rocker</h3>\n<p>January 27th, 1969 (Apple Studios, London): A chipper George is the last to arrive at the studio while the rest of the group is having breakfast. He tells the group that he was up the previous night writing a song (prompting John to reveal that he’s been having trouble sleeping himself), in mind of John’s old advice to finish a song within the time you start writing it. This, in full awareness of John’s own less-than-disciplined creative process, incites knowing laughter from the group. (Note: The song George wrote was ‘Old Brown Shoe’.)</p>\n<p>JOHN: I have a complaint as a director of Apple – no bog paper.</p>\n<p>PAUL: Oh yeah? [Yoko laughs]</p>\n<p>JOHN: Terrible disgrace.</p>\n<p>PAUL: They’ve got [it in] pink upstairs.</p>\n<p>JOHN: Have they?</p>\n<p>PAUL: Yeah. [George arrives]</p>\n<p>JOHN: Hi.</p>\n<p>PAUL: Hi, George.</p>\n<p>GEORGE: Hello, how are you? Happy new year!</p>\n<p>JOHN: [joking] George’s just come from a party too.</p>\n<p>GEORGE: [laughs] Yeah, I thought…</p>\n<p>JOHN: Two hours extra sleep [inaudible].</p>\n<p>GEORGE: Oh, I didn’t, I went to bed very late. I wrote a new song, actually.</p>\n<p>JOHN: I couldn’t sleep.</p>\n<p>GEORGE: I wrote a great song actually.</p>\n<p>JOHN: About what? [taps out a familiar rhythm in question]</p>\n<p>GEORGE: No, though – oh that, no, I just played with that bit. Just – a different one, altogether. Very exciting. [laughs]</p>\n<p>JOHN: It’s such a high when you get home.</p>\n<p>YOKO: Mm.</p>\n<p>GEORGE: Happy. Happy, and a rocker…</p>\n<p>PAUL: Yeah?</p>\n<p>GEORGE: Happy and a rocker! [laughs] Too much.</p>\n<p>…</p>\n<p>JOHN: Well, it’s just so high when you get in at night.</p>\n<p>GEORGE: Yeah, it’s great, isn’t it? [laughs]</p>\n<p>JOHN: I just – you know, that bit like on acid, where you see a little hand miles away.</p>\n<p>PAUL: Mm.</p>\n<p>JOHN: I was just sitting there listening to the last bit. [stage whisper] “Help! What if I have? What if I haven’t, today?” [laughter] You know, “[inaudible] Do they have anything?”</p>\n<p>YOKO: You should just try in general.</p>\n<p>JOHN: I just can’t sleep! I just— [starts making garbled noises and sounds] You know. “I’m a feeling a little thing here…” [makes the sound of a trumpet blaring; laughs]</p>\n<p>GEORGE: Uh, I keep thinking, “Oh, I’ll just go to bed now,” and then I keep hearing your voice from about ten years ago saying, “Finish ‘em straightaway. As soon as you start ‘em, you’ve got finish it too.” [pause] You once told me it was best to finish a song, so I was just there to… [uproarious laughter]</p>\n<p>JOHN: [laughs] But I never do it, you know. I can’t do it. But I know it’s the best.</p>\n<p>PAUL: Yeah.</p>\n<h3 id=\"oh-darling\">‘Oh! Darling’</h3>\n<p>January 27th, 1969 (Apple Studios, London): The Beatles play an extended run-through of ‘Oh! Darling’, with John offering harmony and call-and-response to Paul’s lead vocal. (Note: A considerably shorter and edited version of this take was included on Anthology 3.)</p>\n<p>PAUL: When you told me…</p>\n<p>JOHN: When you told me…</p>\n<p>PAUL: You didn’t need me…</p>\n<p>JOHN: You’d never leave me…</p>\n<p>PAUL: Anymore / You know I nearly broke down and died / Oh when you told me / You didn’t need me anymore / You know I nearly broke down and died…</p>\n<h3 id=\"bring-it-on-home-to-me--oh-darling\">‘Bring It On Home To Me’ / ‘Oh! Darling’</h3>\n<p>January 27th, 1969 (Apple Studios, London): John and Paul sing an ephemeral mashup of Sam Cooke’s ‘Bring It On Home To Me’ and ‘Oh! Darling’ before segueing into ‘Oh! Darling’ proper.</p>\n<h3 id=\"get-back\">‘Get Back’</h3>\n<p>January 27th, 1969: Paul sings an amusing mock-German version of ‘Get Back’ (along with liberal doses of mock-French).</p>\n<h3 id=\"i-cried-for-water-water-all-i-want-is-drink\">I cried for water, water, all I want is drink</h3>\n<p>January 27th, 1969: John and Paul play a bluesy mash-up during the Let It Be sessions, with John taking lead vocal for ‘Get Back’, and Paul singing an unidentified song (possibly made up on the spot) full of holy, apocalyptic fervor.</p>\n<p>PAUL: Order! Order! We’ve got to call order, John, I mean, you know, we’re wasting valuable time here, son.</p>\n<p>JOHN: Don’t let me down, babe!</p>\n<h2 id=\"128\">1/28</h2>\n<h3 id=\"attracts-me-like-a-pomegranate\">Attracts me like a pomegranate</h3>\n<p>January 28th, 1969: The Beatles work on how to play ‘Something’, while George figures out the lyrics for the song.</p>\n<p>GEORGE: Attracts me like a pomegranate… [laughs] We could have that, “attracts me like a pomegranate.”</p>\n<p>…</p>\n<p>JOHN: What were you saying?</p>\n<p>GEORGE: I was saying, uh, “Did you know who missed the show?” And to a chorus of, “I don’t know, I don’t know.”</p>\n<h3 id=\"even-badness-must-pass\">Even badness must pass</h3>\n<p>January 28th, 1969: After John and Paul play a lethargic and depressed run-through of ‘All Things Must Pass’, George tries to convince them that the song can be optimistic, too.</p>\n<p>GEORGE: But it’s happy too, because it’s like – it’s like, if all things pass… it is sad [if] it means it’s always gonna leave something there. Doesn’t it? It means even badness must pass. You know. It’s like… [long pause]</p>\n<p>PAUL: Nothing’s permanent.</p>\n<p>GEORGE: ‘Cause it said, uh, the last one says, “Darkness doesn’t last all night time, and in the morning, it will fade away.” [pause] “Sunlight—” What is it? “Daylight – is—”</p>\n<p>PAUL: “The sunrise doesn’t last all morning.”</p>\n<p>GEORGE: “Daylight is good at arriving at the right time.” ‘Cause it always does. It gets so dark, and suddenly – it just comes at the right time, and, you know. Like this was—</p>\n<p>PAUL: It’s another shade of darkness, isn’t it? Or light.</p>\n<h3 id=\"i-wish-that-for-just-one-time-you-could-stand-inside-my-shoes\">I wish that for just one time you could stand inside my shoes</h3>\n<p>January 28th, 1969: In a not-uncommon instance of subliminal messaging (ergo musical commentary) during the Let It Be sessions, George sings a strain from Bob Dylan’s ‘Positively 4th Street’. Paul, unwittingly or not, joins in.</p>\n<p>GEORGE: And I know you’re dissatisfied with your position and your place; don’t you understand it’s not my problem? I wish that for just one time, you could stand inside my shoes, and just for that one moment, I could be you… I wish that for just one time, you could stand inside my shoes… You’d know what a drag it is to see you…</p>\n<h2 id=\"129\">1/29</h2>\n<h3 id=\"we-could-be-into-other-things\">We could be into other things</h3>\n<p>January 29th, 1969 (Apple Studios, London): A scattered morning discussion with Michael Lindsay-Hogg, Glyn Johns, and George Martin on the advent of having the group perform on the Apple Studios rooftop leads Paul into a circular conversation with John about the multiple media ventures they’re trying to pursue with this one recording session, and the persisting concern that the Beatles’ apparent lack of restriction (and lack of tolerance for having others impose restrictions upon them) is actually counterproductive to their efforts to complete the recording of the album. At a loss for articulating in concrete terms what may be obstructing the group from performing as well as they could, Paul wonders if they can only be cured of their repression and/or indecision if they are thrust unexpectedly into a foreign situation and forced by circumstance to adapt and improve unquestioningly, as they experienced in the early days of the band.</p>\n<p>(Note: An edited segment of this discussion was later included in the official Let It Be documentary, as is depicted in this gif set here. Overall, the reality of John and Paul’s exchange is less one-sided than it may seem in the film; this excerpt in itself is but a portion of it, and it shortly after expands to include George as well when he arrives at the studio.)</p>\n<p>JOHN: I can’t wait to work, here, you know.</p>\n<p>PAUL: Yeah.</p>\n<p>JOHN: Either… Anyway, you know. I just can’t wait to just—</p>\n<p>PAUL: Do it.</p>\n<p>JOHN: —have it, you know.</p>\n<p>PAUL: Yeah, but so… Hmm. But I’m just talking about this thing, like this thing we’ve entered upon now, we still haven’t got any aim for it, except another album, again. Our only aim, ever, is an album. Which is like a very non-visual thing, it’s very sort of… But it’s great, isn’t it, and we do albums, then. But—</p>\n<p>JOHN: But albums is what we’re doing, at the moment.</p>\n<p>PAUL: [uneasy] Yeah, but I don’t know. Like—</p>\n<p>JOHN: I mean, that’s what we [inaudible] talk about.</p>\n<p>PAUL: —like I was saying the other day, is that you – is that you – you— [hesitating] We’re into albums as the four of us, but I really think we could be into other things. But every time I talk about it, I really sound like I’m the showbiz correspondent, trying to hustle us to do a Judy Garland comeback, you know. But really, all I mean is – well, look, let’s get – let’s change, or let’s go into a studio, like a vision studio, after we’ve learnt all of these, that’s just as good as this for sound, that’s got the same sort of thinking…</p>\n<p>JOHN: I think it’s daft to move from this one, you know, I mean—</p>\n<p>PAUL: But it’s like we got much better takes after we moved from Twickenham to here.</p>\n<p>JOHN: Oh, yeah, but I mean here, in our life it’s like home, you know.</p>\n<p>PAUL: Yeah, sure, but our takes are getting not as good. So I’m just trying to think of a remedy.</p>\n<p>JOHN:Yes, but it’s up to Glyn to take it.</p>\n<p>PAUL: Which he has been doing all yesterday, now, and ‘Get Back’, like you said, you know, we’re not in it.</p>\n<p>JOHN: Yeah, but that depends on the day.</p>\n<p>PAUL: But the thing that puts us in it are the things – the only ever thing that has put us in it is a novelty. We’re, you know—</p>\n<p>JOHN: Yes, yes.</p>\n<p>PAUL: We’re ve– we work on novelty. If there’s a new approach, if he says, “Take”, we take for the first time.</p>\n<p>JOHN: Mm.</p>\n<p>PAUL: Oh, you know, I mean, we’re gonna be great in the rough dubs, these, because we don’t care, you know, and it’s great. And now it’s gonna be very hard to better those – that dub we’ve got. There’s just so much in it, even ‘Teddy Boy’, not having words. It’s just, there’s so much in all of that.</p>\n<p>JOHN: Yeah. Yeah, I have to agree—</p>\n<p>PAUL: And it’s like, it’s gonna be hard to better it.</p>\n<p>JOHN: —but I don’t think another move is gonna be the answer. It’s just like every—[inaudible]</p>\n<p>PAUL: You see, I said to Michael that he should really just—just black this, just make this black one day, so that when we come in in the morning, it’s – “What is it?” I mean, you know. You’ve got to be sneaky with the Beatles, or else we’ll just go on forever in a circle. We really won’t get out of it. ‘Cause whenever we talk about it, we have certain rules – like George was saying. “What do you want to do?” And he says, “No films.” But it’s wrong, that. It’s very wrong, though, because you don’t know. He says – what he means is, “No Help! or Hard Day’s,” and I agree, you know. But like, films – ‘cause this is a film – and he now doesn’t mind this.</p>\n<p>JOHN: Yeah.</p>\n<p>PAUL: But it’s like – it’s that kind of thing, like no TV shows, no audience. But, I mean – see, it’s like when we came back from Hamburg and did Leicester Du Montfort Hall, or wherever it was, Coventry – we played the ballroom, and we had the worst first night then, and we were all nervous, and it was terrible. Then we played another the next night, and we got a little bit better; the next night, hmm; and then the next! [vocalising] It was just too much, and we got into the playing because we got over the hang-up of the audience, and it was just like there was no one there, but it was a ner– a new sort of thing, and there was some fella in the front watching how you were playing… you know? And you just – we were just right into it. And those would have been – if we could have recorded those things, they will have been the greatest, because it is. It’s like Mal was saying, he said, “It’s the bounce thing,” you know. And we’re good at that, you know, once we get over the nervousness. But it’s like, it’s the hurdle of that nervousness is there, now. So that… you know. [hesitating] We’re – we can’t get over it now, unless – well, unless we really sort of, like, go to the Albert Hall and get in a black bag, you know.</p>\n<p>JOHN: Mm.</p>\n<p>PAUL: There’s no other way. We can’t think ourselves out of it. And we can’t sort of say, well, it will be alright. See, and then the only other alternative to that is to say, well, we don’t – we will never do it to an audience again. But if we intend to – to keep any sort of contact on that scene… [pause] Yeah. I do understand George’s just saying, “There’s no point,” you know, because it is like we’re Stravinsky, and it’s in the music. And he doesn’t sort of get up and play his ‘Joanna’ for them anymore. He just writes it, and just sort of maybe occasionally conducts it.</p>\n<p>JOHN: But as long as there’s a good reason – like George wants to do a heavy show, like Dylan and Presley, all that.</p>\n<p>PAUL: Mm.</p>\n<p>JOHN: And that’ll be a large – I don’t know, like, I mean, that – that’s all this.</p>\n<p>PAUL: Mm, yeah, I know, yeah. that’s always – that’s always just—</p>\n<p>JOHN: Okay, yeah.</p>\n<p>PAUL: That’s us again, you know.</p>\n<p>JOHN: Yes, I know.</p>\n<p>PAUL: It’s us going silly again.</p>\n<p>JOHN: It is, and I think – I think we might do it.</p>\n<p>PAUL: Yeah, sure, but I mean the thing is they could do that one after you’ve done your own one, you know.</p>\n<p>JOHN: Yes, yeah. But I think that—</p>\n<p>PAUL: It’s like, it’s like this thing, man. There is a show to be had out of what we’ve got here, which is just so incredible. It’s unbelievable. And you don’t have to go on the roof, you don’t have to go anywhere. You really only have to sing ‘em. And combined with the documentary material leading up to it, it’s just like an unbelievable thing. Because you’ll have the two elements and you’ve got it there, and there’s no – we don’t need any need to move from here. But somehow we need to get us for the – see, it’s like we’ve got all the lead-up, and the only thing we haven’t got for every song is the – the song, yet.</p>\n<h3 id=\"i-enjoy-it-too-sometimes\">I enjoy it too, sometimes</h3>\n<p>January 29th, 1969: John and Paul work carefully on their vocal harmony for the refrain of ‘Dig A Pony’. John, whose voice is tired and strained, is self-deprecating about his own efforts. Paul, perhaps attuned to it, is quick to profess his admiration for the song.</p>\n<p>JOHN &#x26; PAUL: All I want is you…</p>\n<p>JOHN: But see, now we get into adding a little bit more paint, you know.</p>\n<p>PAUL: It’s alright, yeah. No, that’s good, that one.</p>\n<p>JOHN: Okay, tick it.</p>\n<p>PAUL: [sincere] I love that one.</p>\n<p>JOHN: [reticent] Thank you.</p>\n<p>PAUL: [insistent] I really really do.</p>\n<p>JOHN: Thank you. [quiet] I enjoy it too. Sometimes. [pause] So that’s done.</p>\n<p>PAUL: Um—</p>\n<p>JOHN: Next, please</p>\n<h3 id=\"im-just-gonna-do-me-for-a-bit\">I’m just gonna do me for a bit</h3>\n<p>January 29th, 1969 (Apple Studios, London): With some reservation (and/or hesitation), George expresses his desire to record and release an album of solo material after the sessions for Get Back/Let It Be are concluded, in mind of all the songs he’s written and accumulated over the years. John and Yoko support the idea, but George (perhaps sensing that John’s perception of “going solo” and what it symbolises is more absolute than his own) elaborates that he thinks it’d be a good thing not just for each member of the band, but for the Beatles as a band proper - they would be able to both free themselves creatively in their own personal outlets as well as play and record as a group without feeling stifled, innately in tune with one another.</p>\n<p>(In other words, the band doesn’t  have to sever all ties to go their own way. Ultimately, it’s difficult to determine if George is merely expressing, in a carefully unassuming way, his own intentions for individuation in light of John’s recent solo output with Yoko and growing estrangement from the Beatles family, or if he is making a discrete appeal to John of making up instead of breaking up, and is still, despite all of the Beatles’ overlapping troubles over the past two years, not least the past two weeks, genuinely attuned to the idea of the band staying together. Your mileage may vary.)</p>\n<p>GEORGE: John.</p>\n<p>JOHN: Yeah?</p>\n<p>GEORGE: I tell you what I’d like to do. After this—</p>\n<p>PAUL: After this TV—?</p>\n<p>GEORGE: —after this show. Um, you know, I’ve got so many songs that I’ve got, like, my quota of tunes for the next ten – you know, years, or albums.</p>\n<p>JOHN: Yeah.</p>\n<p>GEORGE: And I’d just like to maybe do an album, of songs.</p>\n<p>JOHN: Of – on your own?</p>\n<p>GEORGE: Yeah.</p>\n<p>JOHN: Yeah.</p>\n<p>GEORGE: But I mean, I’d like it so that if… uh… [long pause] ‘Cause it would be nice, it would be nice to mainly get them all out of the way—</p>\n<p>JOHN: Yeah. It’d be nice anyway.</p>\n<p>GEORGE: And secondly, just to hear what I – what all mine are like all together.</p>\n<p>JOHN: Yeah, as long – you see, it’s good. If we put [out] an LP and it’s all safe that will be ‘cause it’s together, but George is doing an album and—</p>\n<p>GEORGE: Oh yeah, but I mean it’d be nice to, uh—</p>\n<p>JOHN: It’d be the same as me doing an album.</p>\n<p>GEORGE: —if any of us can do the separate things, like, as well.</p>\n<p>JOHN:</p>\n<p>Well, I mean—</p>\n<p>GEORGE: That way, it also preserves this, the Beatle bit of it, more. ‘Cause then—</p>\n<p>JOHN: This – there’s an outlet for every note you want.</p>\n<p>GEORGE: You know, ‘cause all these songs of mine, I can give them to people who could do them good, but I suddenly realised – fuck all that. I’m just gonna do me for a bit. [laughs] You know?</p>\n<p>YOKO: That’s great. That’s a good idea.</p>\n<p>JOHN: Yeah.</p>\n<p>GEORGE: And uh, you know.

They provided a stable, supportive, and loving working-class home in Liverpool.\r\n* Unlike John's absent parents or Paul's tragic loss, George's family life was remarkably normal and encouraging.\r\n\r\n### Nature of Their Influence\r\n\r\nThe Harrisons were the **bedrock of normality and encouragement** in George's life. His mother was a passionate music fan who was his earliest and most vocal supporter. His father instilled a quiet work ethic and a sense of doing things properly. This stable foundation gave George the confidence to pursue his passion but also a profound sense of being grounded, which later put him at odds with the surreal excesses of fame.\r\n\r\n### Their Relationship with The Beatles & Influence on Harrison's Decisions\r\n\r\n* **Relationship:** They were immensely proud and actively involved in the early days. Louise famously wrote back to fan mail and was a constant, cheering presence at early gigs.\r\n* **Influence:** Because he never had to fight for approval at home, George could focus his battles elsewhere: namely, inside the band. His secure upbringing meant he wasn't seeking a replacement family in The Beatles. This gave him the psychological fortitude to eventually demand creative space from the dominant Lennon-McCartney axis and, ultimately, to seek fulfillment outside the group structure entirely.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## **Ravi Shankar** (Guru and Sitar Master)\r\n\r\n### Shankar's Role in Harrison's Life\r\n\r\n* A world-renowned master of the sitar and Indian classical music.\r\n* He became George's music teacher, spiritual guide, and a lifelong friend after they met in 1966.\r\n\r\n### Nature of Shankar's Influence\r\n\r\nRavi Shankar was the **architect of George's spiritual and adult identity**. He did more than teach George an instrument; he introduced him to a profound philosophy, a rich culture, and a spiritual worldview that offered a meaningful alternative to the empty materialism of Western stardom. Shankar provided the \"answer\" George had been searching for, giving him a purpose beyond being a Beatle.\r\n\r\n### Shankar's Relationship with The Beatles & Influence on Harrison's Decisions\r\n\r\n* **Relationship:** While respected by the others, Shankar's connection was intensely personal to George. His influence fundamentally changed the band's sound.\r\n* **Influence:** This relationship was the single most important factor in George's artistic divergence. It led directly to him introducing the sitar on \"Norwegian Wood\" and composing the fully Indian-classical \"Within You Without You\" for *Sgt. Pepper*. This new spiritual path gave him the confidence to see his own songs as equally valid to John's and Paul's, and the courage to pursue projects they had no interest in, like the landmark Concert for Bangladesh, which he organized at Shankar's behest.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## **Eric Clapton** (The Peer)\r\n\r\n### Clapton's Role in Harrison's Life\r\n\r\n* A fellow rock guitarist, widely regarded in the mid-60s as a \"God\" of the instrument.\r\n* He became one of George's closest friends, a musical collaborator, and for a time, a romantic rival for the affections of Pattie Boyd.\r\n\r\n### Nature of Clapton's Influence\r\n\r\nClapton was the **source of external musical validation**. In a band where he was often overshadowed and his guitar parts dictated by Paul, George saw Clapton as a respected peer. Clapton's reverence for the blues and his identity as a pure musician—not just a pop star—represented an artistic authenticity that George craved. Their friendship was a partnership of equals.\r\n\r\n### Clapton's Relationship with The Beatles & Influence on Harrison's Decisions\r\n\r\n* **Relationship:** Clapton was a trusted friend who was famously invited into the band's \"inner sanctum.\"\r\n* **Influence:** Inviting Clapton to play the guitar solo on \"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\" was an unprecedented act of assertion by George. It broke the band's unwritten rule of no outside musicians on their records and was a power move to force John and Paul to take his songwriting seriously. It worked. This moment was a crucial step in George's journey toward self-confidence and a clear signal that he was willing to look outside The Beatles for artistic fulfillment.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## **Derek Taylor** (The Confidant)\r\n\r\n### Taylor's Role in Harrison's Life\r\n\r\n* The Beatles' sharp, witty, and deeply trusted press officer during two stints in the 1960s.\r\n* He was an intellectual and a fellow traveler on the path of spiritual discovery, becoming a particularly close friend and ally to George.\r\n\r\n### Nature of Taylor's Influence\r\n\r\nDerek Taylor was the **sympathetic ear within the machine**. While others in the Beatles' circle were focused on business or music, Taylor was a writer and thinker who understood and shared George's burgeoning interest in spirituality and his disillusionment with fame. He offered intellectual and moral support, acting as a sounding board for ideas that the others might dismiss.\r\n\r\n### Taylor's Relationship with The Beatles & Influence on Harrison's Decisions\r\n\r\n* **Relationship:** As the head of Apple Corps' press office, he was a key insider who was uniquely loyal to all four Beatles, but he formed a special bond with George.\r\n* **Influence:** Taylor's encouragement was vital. He helped George articulate his new worldview and championed his songs within the organization. When George felt most isolated and creatively stifled, having a trusted, high-level ally like Taylor bolstered his resolve. This support system was crucial for George to maintain his course, pursue projects like his solo album *Wonderwall Music*, and feel he had a voice and a future beyond the band's confines.","src/content/research/harrison-key-influential-characters.md","7eb3697fdb820777",{html:2138,metadata:2139},"<h2 id=\"harold--louise-harrison-parents\"><strong>Harold &#x26; Louise Harrison</strong> (Parents)</h2>\n<h3 id=\"their-role-in-harrisons-life\">Their Role in Harrison’s Life</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>His father, Harold, was a bus conductor and his mother, Louise, was a shop assistant.

His influence fundamentally changed the band’s sound.</li>\n<li><strong>Influence:</strong> This relationship was the single most important factor in George’s artistic divergence. It led directly to him introducing the sitar on “Norwegian Wood” and composing the fully Indian-classical “Within You Without You” for <em>Sgt. Pepper</em>. This new spiritual path gave him the confidence to see his own songs as equally valid to John’s and Paul’s, and the courage to pursue projects they had no interest in, like the landmark Concert for Bangladesh, which he organized at Shankar’s behest.</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"eric-clapton-the-peer\"><strong>Eric Clapton</strong> (The Peer)</h2>\n<h3 id=\"claptons-role-in-harrisons-life\">Clapton’s Role in Harrison’s Life</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>A fellow rock guitarist, widely regarded in the mid-60s as a “God” of the instrument.</li>\n<li>He became one of George’s closest friends, a musical collaborator, and for a time, a romantic rival for the affections of Pattie Boyd.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"nature-of-claptons-influence\">Nature of Clapton’s Influence</h3>\n<p>Clapton was the <strong>source of external musical validation</strong>. In a band where he was often overshadowed and his guitar parts dictated by Paul, George saw Clapton as a respected peer. Clapton’s reverence for the blues and his identity as a pure musician—not just a pop star—represented an artistic authenticity that George craved. Their friendship was a partnership of equals.</p>\n<h3 id=\"claptons-relationship-with-the-beatles--influence-on-harrisons-decisions\">Clapton’s Relationship with The Beatles &#x26; Influence on Harrison’s Decisions</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Relationship:</strong> Clapton was a trusted friend who was famously invited into the band’s “inner sanctum.”</li>\n<li><strong>Influence:</strong> Inviting Clapton to play the guitar solo on “While My Guitar Gently Weeps” was an unprecedented act of assertion by George. It broke the band’s unwritten rule of no outside musicians on their records and was a power move to force John and Paul to take his songwriting seriously. It worked. This moment was a crucial step in George’s journey toward self-confidence and a clear signal that he was willing to look outside The Beatles for artistic fulfillment.</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"derek-taylor-the-confidant\"><strong>Derek Taylor</strong> (The Confidant)</h2>\n<h3 id=\"taylors-role-in-harrisons-life\">Taylor’s Role in Harrison’s Life</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>The Beatles’ sharp, witty, and deeply trusted press officer during two stints in the 1960s.</li>\n<li>He was an intellectual and a fellow traveler on the path of spiritual discovery, becoming a particularly close friend and ally to George.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"nature-of-taylors-influence\">Nature of Taylor’s Influence</h3>\n<p>Derek Taylor was the <strong>sympathetic ear within the machine</strong>. While others in the Beatles’ circle were focused on business or music, Taylor was a writer and thinker who understood and shared George’s burgeoning interest in spirituality and his disillusionment with fame. He offered intellectual and moral support, acting as a sounding board for ideas that the others might dismiss.</p>\n<h3 id=\"taylors-relationship-with-the-beatles--influence-on-harrisons-decisions\">Taylor’s Relationship with The Beatles &#x26; Influence on Harrison’s Decisions</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Relationship:</strong> As the head of Apple Corps’ press office, he was a key insider who was uniquely loyal to all four Beatles, but he formed a special bond with George.</li>\n<li><strong>Influence:</strong> Taylor’s encouragement was vital. He helped George articulate his new worldview and championed his songs within the organization. When George felt most isolated and creatively stifled, having a trusted, high-level ally like Taylor bolstered his resolve. This support system was crucial for George to maintain his course, pursue projects like his solo album <em>Wonderwall Music</em>, and feel he had a voice and a future beyond the band’s confines.</li>\n</ul>",{headings:2140,localImagePaths:2189,remoteImagePaths:2190,frontmatter:2191,imagePaths:2194},[2141,2144,2147,2150,2153,2156,2159,2162,2165,2168,2171,2174,2177,2180,2183,2186],{depth:89,slug:2142,text:2143},"harold--louise-harrison-parents","Harold & Louise Harrison (Parents)",{depth:64,slug:2145,text:2146},"their-role-in-harrisons-life","Their Role in Harrison’s Life",{depth:64,slug:2148,text:2149},"nature-of-their-influence","Nature of Their Influence",{depth:64,slug:2151,text:2152},"their-relationship-with-the-beatles--influence-on-harrisons-decisions","Their Relationship with The Beatles & Influence on Harrison’s Decisions",{depth:89,slug:2154,text:2155},"ravi-shankar-guru-and-sitar-master","Ravi Shankar (Guru and Sitar Master)",{depth:64,slug:2157,text:2158},"shankars-role-in-harrisons-life","Shankar’s Role in Harrison’s Life",{depth:64,slug:2160,text:2161},"nature-of-shankars-influence","Nature of Shankar’s Influence",{depth:64,slug:2163,text:2164},"shankars-relationship-with-the-beatles--influence-on-harrisons-decisions","Shankar’s Relationship with The Beatles & Influence on Harrison’s Decisions",{depth:89,slug:2166,text:2167},"eric-clapton-the-peer","Eric Clapton (The Peer)",{depth:64,slug:2169,text:2170},"claptons-role-in-harrisons-life","Clapton’s Role in Harrison’s Life",{depth:64,slug:2172,text:2173},"nature-of-claptons-influence","Nature of Clapton’s Influence",{depth:64,slug:2175,text:2176},"claptons-relationship-with-the-beatles--influence-on-harrisons-decisions","Clapton’s Relationship with The Beatles & Influence on Harrison’s Decisions",{depth:89,slug:2178,text:2179},"derek-taylor-the-confidant","Derek Taylor (The Confidant)",{depth:64,slug:2181,text:2182},"taylors-role-in-harrisons-life","Taylor’s Role in Harrison’s Life",{depth:64,slug:2184,text:2185},"nature-of-taylors-influence","Nature of Taylor’s Influence",{depth:64,slug:2187,text:2188},"taylors-relationship-with-the-beatles--influence-on-harrisons-decisions","Taylor’s Relationship with The Beatles & Influence on Harrison’s Decisions",[],[],{title:2123,category:1426,date_range:2124,reliability:1566,relevance:2125,tags:2192,created:2193},[1698,2127,2128,2129,2130,1496,2131,2132],["Date","2025-07-24T00:00:00.000Z"],[],"harrison-key-influential-characters.md","harrison-quotes",{id:2196,data:2198,body:2205,filePath:2206,digest:2207,rendered:2208,legacyId:2245},{title:2199,category:1426,date_range:2200,reliability:1408,relevance:2201,tags:2202,created:2204},"George Harrison: Exhaustive Quote Compilation","1960–2001","To help capture George Harrison's unique voice and way of speaking, gathered from interviews, film, and lyrics—capturing his blend of deep spirituality, dry wit, and musical introspection.",[1698,2203,1799,2132],"quotes",["Date","2025-07-24T00:00:00.000Z"],"## Philosophical & Reflective Quotes\r\n\r\n- “All things must pass.

A scene filmed in a fictional Indian restaurant featured session musicians playing the instrument. While the music was played for comic effect in the film, the unique, droning sound captivated Harrison.\r\n* **The Acquisition:** Shortly after, Harrison was at a London studio session when a friend mentioned the Indian section of London. Intrigued, he visited a shop called Indiacraft and purchased his first, relatively cheap sitar. At this stage, it was an object of **exotic curiosity**, not a serious musical pursuit. He would toy with it at home, trying to figure out how to make sounds, but without any formal knowledge.\r\n\r\n### **Phase 2: The First Experiment and Global Impact (Late 1965)**\r\n\r\n* **The Song:** During the recording sessions for the *Rubber Soul* album in October 1965, John Lennon was working on the song \"Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown).\" The song's contemplative, slightly melancholic mood felt like a fit for a new sound. Harrison suggested using the sitar.\r\n* **The Performance:** Harrison worked out a simple, melodic line that mimicked the song's main melody. It was not played in an authentic Indian classical style; rather, it was used as an **exotic texture**, a new color in the band's sonic palette.\r\n* **The Impact:** The release of \"Norwegian Wood\" was a watershed moment in pop music. It was the first time a sitar had been featured so prominently on a Western pop record. The effect was immediate and immense, kicking off the \"raga rock\" trend and cementing the sitar as the definitive sound of psychedelia. For Harrison, its success transformed the instrument from a passing fancy into a serious point of focus.\r\n\r\n### **Phase 3: The Meeting of the Master (June 1966)**\r\n\r\n* **The Introduction:** Deepening his interest, Harrison was introduced to the world's foremost sitar virtuoso, **Ravi Shankar**, at the home of a mutual friend in London. This meeting was the single most important event in Harrison's journey with the instrument.\r\n* **The Shift in Perspective:** Harrison asked Shankar to teach him. Shankar was initially hesitant, wary of a pop star's fleeting interest. But he sensed a genuine humility and spiritual hunger in Harrison. This meeting shifted Harrison's goal from simply \"playing the sitar\" to understanding the deep spiritual and philosophical tradition from which the music emerged. The sitar was no longer just an instrument; it became a **discipline and a path to enlightenment**.\r\n\r\n### **Phase 4: The Path of the Disciple (Late 1966 – 1968)**\r\n\r\n* **Immersion in India:** In September 1966, after the Beatles' final concert, Harrison and his wife Pattie flew to India, where he studied sitar formally under Shankar for six weeks. This demonstrated a profound commitment, removing himself from the chaos of Beatlemania to become an anonymous, humble student.\r\n* **Artistic Evolution:** His study under Shankar is directly audible in his compositions.\r\n  * **\"Love You To\" (*Revolver*, 1966):** His first composition to fully embrace Indian classical structure, featuring sitar, tabla, and a tanpura drone. It was a quantum leap from the simple melody of \"Norwegian Wood.\"\r\n  * **\"Within You Without You\" (*Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band*, 1967):** The apex of his Indian-influenced work. Recorded with Indian musicians and no other Beatles, it is a piece of pure Indian classical music fused with a Western string arrangement. Lyrically, it is a philosophical sermon, demonstrating that the music and the spiritual message were now inextricably linked for him.\r\n\r\n### **Phase 5: The Withdrawal and Lasting Legacy (1968 onwards)**\r\n\r\n* **The Realization:** By 1968, Harrison began to pull back from being the \"sitar guy.\" He came to a critical realization: mastering the instrument would take a lifetime of dedication that he couldn't give. He felt the popularization he'd started had led to the sitar becoming a cheap gimmick in Western pop, a trend he felt guilty for creating.\r\n* **Returning to His Roots:** He consciously decided to return to his primary instrument, the guitar. He famously said, \"I'm a guitarist,\" re-engaging with rock and roll with a renewed vigor that led to songs like \"While My Guitar Gently Weeps.\"\r\n* **The True Legacy:** While his active period of playing sitar was relatively brief (approx. 3 years), its impact was permanent. The sitar was never the end goal; it was the **catalyst for a profound personal transformation**.\r\n    1. It gave him a unique musical identity within The Beatles.\r\n    2. It introduced him to Ravi Shankar, who became his lifelong friend and guru.\r\n    3. It opened the door to Hindu philosophy and meditation, which became the bedrock of his life.\r\n    4. The relationship with Shankar led directly to the 1971 **Concert for Bangladesh**, Harrison's greatest humanitarian achievement.\r\n\r\nIn essence, the sitar was the instrument that allowed George Harrison to find his own voice, not just musically, but spiritually, leading him out of the shadow of Lennon-McCartney and into the light of his own identity.","src/content/research/harrison-sitar-influences.md","c39f7d9a24ea4f98",{html:2260,metadata:2261},"<h2 id=\"george-harrisons-sitar-journey\"><strong>George Harrison’s Sitar Journey</strong></h2>\n<h3 id=\"phase-1-initial-encounter-and-curiosity-early-1965\"><strong>Phase 1: Initial Encounter and Curiosity (Early 1965)</strong></h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>The Catalyst:</strong> Harrison’s first direct exposure to the sitar occurred during the filming of <em>Help!</em> in April 1965. A scene filmed in a fictional Indian restaurant featured session musicians playing the instrument. While the music was played for comic effect in the film, the unique, droning sound captivated Harrison.</li>\n<li><strong>The Acquisition:</strong> Shortly after, Harrison was at a London studio session when a friend mentioned the Indian section of London. Intrigued, he visited a shop called Indiacraft and purchased his first, relatively cheap sitar. At this stage, it was an object of <strong>exotic curiosity</strong>, not a serious musical pursuit. He would toy with it at home, trying to figure out how to make sounds, but without any formal knowledge.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"phase-2-the-first-experiment-and-global-impact-late-1965\"><strong>Phase 2: The First Experiment and Global Impact (Late 1965)</strong></h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>The Song:</strong> During the recording sessions for the <em>Rubber Soul</em> album in October 1965, John Lennon was working on the song “Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown).” The song’s contemplative, slightly melancholic mood felt like a fit for a new sound. Harrison suggested using the sitar.</li>\n<li><strong>The Performance:</strong> Harrison worked out a simple, melodic line that mimicked the song’s main melody. It was not played in an authentic Indian classical style; rather, it was used as an <strong>exotic texture</strong>, a new color in the band’s sonic palette.</li>\n<li><strong>The Impact:</strong> The release of “Norwegian Wood” was a watershed moment in pop music. It was the first time a sitar had been featured so prominently on a Western pop record. The effect was immediate and immense, kicking off the “raga rock” trend and cementing the sitar as the definitive sound of psychedelia. For Harrison, its success transformed the instrument from a passing fancy into a serious point of focus.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"phase-3-the-meeting-of-the-master-june-1966\"><strong>Phase 3: The Meeting of the Master (June 1966)</strong></h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>The Introduction:</strong> Deepening his interest, Harrison was introduced to the world’s foremost sitar virtuoso, <strong>Ravi Shankar</strong>, at the home of a mutual friend in London. This meeting was the single most important event in Harrison’s journey with the instrument.</li>\n<li><strong>The Shift in Perspective:</strong> Harrison asked Shankar to teach him. Shankar was initially hesitant, wary of a pop star’s fleeting interest. But he sensed a genuine humility and spiritual hunger in Harrison. This meeting shifted Harrison’s goal from simply “playing the sitar” to understanding the deep spiritual and philosophical tradition from which the music emerged. The sitar was no longer just an instrument; it became a <strong>discipline and a path to enlightenment</strong>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"phase-4-the-path-of-the-disciple-late-1966--1968\"><strong>Phase 4: The Path of the Disciple (Late 1966 – 1968)</strong></h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Immersion in India:</strong> In September 1966, after the Beatles’ final concert, Harrison and his wife Pattie flew to India, where he studied sitar formally under Shankar for six weeks. This demonstrated a profound commitment, removing himself from the chaos of Beatlemania to become an anonymous, humble student.</li>\n<li><strong>Artistic Evolution:</strong> His study under Shankar is directly audible in his compositions.\n<ul>\n<li><strong>“Love You To” (<em>Revolver</em>, 1966):</strong> His first composition to fully embrace Indian classical structure, featuring sitar, tabla, and a tanpura drone. It was a quantum leap from the simple melody of “Norwegian Wood.”</li>\n<li><strong>“Within You Without You” (<em>Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band</em>, 1967):</strong> The apex of his Indian-influenced work. Recorded with Indian musicians and no other Beatles, it is a piece of pure Indian classical music fused with a Western string arrangement. Lyrically, it is a philosophical sermon, demonstrating that the music and the spiritual message were now inextricably linked for him.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"phase-5-the-withdrawal-and-lasting-legacy-1968-onwards\"><strong>Phase 5: The Withdrawal and Lasting Legacy (1968 onwards)</strong></h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>The Realization:</strong> By 1968, Harrison began to pull back from being the “sitar guy.” He came to a critical realization: mastering the instrument would take a lifetime of dedication that he couldn’t give.

He studied sitar with Ravi Shankar and became a pioneer in bringing the instrument into Western rock. His enthusiasm and musicianship introduced the sitar sound to the UK rock scene and directly inspired George Harrison to explore it.\r\n\r\n- **Harrison’s First Exposure:**  \r\n  Influenced by Brian Jones’ sitar playing and growing fascination with Indian sounds, Harrison bought his first sitar in 1965. This marked the beginning of his journey from casual curiosity toward serious study. That same year, he experimented with sitar on the Beatles track “Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown),” the first use of the instrument in a mainstream Western pop song.\r\n\r\n### **Mid-1960s: Cultural Context and Indirect Influences**\r\n\r\n- **David Crosby and the West Coast Psychedelic Scene:**  \r\n  Although David Crosby did not study under Ravi Shankar, his band The Byrds incorporated Indian-inspired sounds (notably in “Eight Miles High”) reflecting the broader American countercultural interest in Eastern spirituality and music. Crosby and peers helped cultivate an atmosphere that overlapped with Harrison’s own explorations, contributing to the zeitgeist that embraced Indian culture.\r\n\r\n### **1966–1967: The Meeting with Ravi Shankar**\r\n\r\n- **Introduction and Initial Curiosity:**  \r\n  By early 1966, Harrison was actively seeking deeper understanding of Indian music and spirituality. In June 1966, George Harrison and his wife Pattie Boyd traveled to Bombay (now Mumbai), India, where he began formal sitar lessons with Ravi Shankar. Shankar had initially been cautious about teaching a pop star but was impressed by Harrison’s sincere interest.\r\n\r\n- **Immersion in Study:**  \r\n  After a few initial lessons in Bombay, Shankar invited Harrison to continue studying in Kashmir that summer. There, Harrison not only studied sitar more intensely but also began absorbing the spiritual aspects of Indian music, including the philosophy behind it. These experiences shaped both his musical and personal life.\r\n\r\n- **Return to London and Musical Output:**  \r\n  Following his studies, Harrison returned to London more confident in his sitar playing. He applied his learning in several Beatles tracks, most notably:\r\n  - **\"Love You To\"** (*Revolver*, 1966)\r\n  - **\"Within You Without You\"** (*Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band*, 1967)\r\n  - **\"The Inner Light\"** (B-side to \"Lady Madonna\", 1968)\r\n\r\n### **Legacy and Continued Influence**\r\n\r\n- **Musical Impact:**  \r\n  Harrison’s study under Shankar influenced not only Beatles songs but also helped introduce Indian classical music to Western pop audiences. The use of sitar and Indian modes contributed heavily to the psychedelic sound of the late 1960s.\r\n\r\n- **Spiritual Connection:**  \r\n  Beyond the sitar, Harrison’s journey with Shankar opened a lifelong path into Hindu philosophy, meditation, and devotion (bhakti yoga). He later became closely associated with the International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON).\r\n\r\n- **Ongoing Collaborations and Friendship:**  \r\n  Harrison and Shankar remained lifelong friends. They collaborated musically many times, most famously during the **Concert for Bangladesh** in 1971 — a historic fusion of activism and music led by Harrison to support refugees from the Bangladesh Liberation War, with Shankar as a key participant.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### **Sitar Timeline Summary (1965–1969)**\r\n\r\n| Year        | Event                                                                 |\r\n|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|\r\n| **1965**    | Bought first sitar; used on “Norwegian Wood”                          |\r\n| **Early 1966** | Sought deeper understanding of Indian music                        |\r\n| **June 1966** | Began sitar lessons with Ravi Shankar in Bombay                    |\r\n| **Summer 1966** | Continued study in Kashmir; immersed in music and philosophy     |\r\n| **1966–1967** | Recorded “Love You To” and “Within You Without You” using sitar     |\r\n| **1968**    | Released “The Inner Light,” further showcasing Indian influence       |\r\n| **1969**    | Deepened spiritual practices and remained musically connected to India |\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Influencers Summary Table\r\n\r\n| Influencer       | Role in Harrison’s Journey                                   |\r\n|------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\r\n| **Brian Jones**  | Early sitar player; introduced Harrison to sitar & Shankar   |\r\n| **David Crosby** | Part of American counterculture embracing Indian sounds; indirect influence via psychedelic scene |\r\n| **Ravi Shankar** | Master sitar teacher and spiritual mentor to Harrison        |","src/content/research/harrison-sitar-timeline.md","69385b9096149708",{html:2298,metadata:2299},"<h2 id=\"george-harrisons-sitar-journey-and-influences\"><strong>George Harrison’s Sitar Journey and Influences</strong></h2>\n<h3 id=\"early-to-mid-1960s-the-first-spark\"><strong>Early to Mid-1960s: The First Spark</strong></h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Brian Jones’ Role:</strong><br>\nBrian Jones of The Rolling Stones was an early British rock musician deeply interested in Indian classical music.

She instilled in him a sharp wit, a love of reading, and a strong sense of his own specialness, but she was deeply skeptical of his artistic ambitions. Her famous line, \"The guitar's all very well, John, but you'll never make a living out of it,\" became the benchmark of loving skepticism that he spent his life rebelling against and trying to overcome. She represented the world of convention and respectability that he both craved and rejected.\r\n\r\n### Mimi's Relationship with The Beatles & Influence on Lennon's Decisions\r\n\r\n* **Relationship:** Mimi was present from the very beginning, watching the Quarrymen practice in her porch. She was fiercely protective of John but often dismissive of the band, viewing them as \"John's noisy friends.\" She remained a grounding force in his life even at the height of Beatlemania.\r\n* **Influence:** Her influence was foundational. While she didn't make business decisions, her skepticism fueled John's ferocious ambition to prove her, and the world, wrong. His desire to escape the conventional life she represented was a primary driver in his quest for fame. In a way, his entire career was an argument with Mimi's worldview.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## **Julia Lennon** (Mother)\r\n\r\n### Julia's Role in Lennon's Life\r\n\r\n* Julia was John's biological mother. After giving him up to be raised by her sister, she re-entered his life during his teenage years.\r\n* She was a free-spirited, vivacious, and musical figure who stood in stark contrast to the stern Mimi.\r\n\r\n### Nature of Julia's Influence\r\n\r\nJulia was the **artistic and emotional core** of John's life. She taught him his first banjo chords, introduced him to rock and roll, and encouraged his rebellious, creative spirit. Her sudden, tragic death—she was killed by a car driven by an off-duty police officer when John was 17—became the central trauma of his existence. This profound loss fueled his deepest art, from the tender \"Julia\" to the primal scream of \"Mother,\" and left him with a lifelong feeling of abandonment.\r\n\r\n### Julia's Relationship with The Beatles & Influence on Lennon's Decisions\r\n\r\n* **Relationship:** Julia was the **spectral muse** of The Beatles. She died before they achieved fame, but her memory was a constant presence. The band itself was, in part, a way for John to channel his grief and rage.\r\n* **Influence:** Her death created a psychological void that John desperately tried to fill. This shaped his intense, often codependent relationships and his search for a mother figure. His need to process this trauma drove much of his songwriting and, ultimately, his decision to undergo Primal Scream therapy, which resulted in his rawest and most personal solo album.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Stuart Sutcliffe (The Lost Beatle / The Artist)\r\n\r\n### Sutcliffe's Role in Lennon's Life\r\n\r\n* Sutcliffe was John's best friend at Liverpool College of Art and the original bassist for The Beatles.\r\n* He was a hugely talented and serious painter who was more dedicated to his art than to music.\r\n\r\n### Nature of Sutcliffe's Influence\r\n\r\nStu was John's **intellectual and aesthetic soulmate**. Before Paul, Stu was John's \"other half.\" He introduced John to a world of European art, literature, and existentialist philosophy. He was responsible for cultivating the early Beatles' \"look\"—the leather jackets and the moody, rebellious \"exi\" (existentialist) image they adopted in Hamburg. He represented the ideal of the pure, uncompromising artist that John always admired and aspired to be.\r\n\r\n### Sutcliffe's Relationship with The Beatles & Influence on Lennon's Decisions\r\n\r\n* **Relationship:** As the original bassist, his connection was foundational. However, his decision to leave the band in 1961 to stay in Hamburg with his fiancée Astrid Kirchherr and pursue painting was a pivotal moment. His sudden death from a brain hemorrhage a year later was the first great tragedy the band endured together.\r\n* **Influence:** Stu’s departure directly led to Paul McCartney taking over on bass, solidifying the classic four-man lineup. More profoundly, his early death cemented him in John's mind as a romantic, tragic figure—an artist who never \"sold out.\" This ideal of artistic purity, untainted by commercialism, was a standard John would later measure himself against, contributing to his own eventual disillusionment with Beatlemania.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Bob Dylan (The Songwriting Guru)\r\n\r\n### Dylan's Role in Lennon's Life\r\n\r\n* The iconic American folk singer was already a towering figure when The Beatles first met him in New York in 1964.\r\n* He was not a personal friend but a powerful, distant artistic peer and rival.\r\n\r\n### Nature of Dylan's Influence\r\n\r\nDylan was the **catalyst for Lennon's lyrical awakening**. He shattered the conventions of the pop song for John. Dylan's complex, surreal, and deeply personal lyrics gave Lennon \"permission\" to move beyond \"I love you, yeah, yeah, yeah.\" The influence was immediate and profound. Songs like \"I'm a Loser\" and \"You've Got to Hide Your Love Away\" are direct results of Lennon absorbing Dylan's folk-inflected introspection. He showed John that a pop star could also be a serious poet.\r\n\r\n### Dylan's Relationship with The Beatles & Influence on Lennon's Decisions\r\n\r\n* **Relationship:** Their relationship was one of mutual respect, intense competition, and a degree of wariness. They were the two most significant songwriters of their generation, constantly observing and reacting to each other's work.\r\n* **Influence:** Dylan's impact was a key factor in the band's artistic evolution from a pop group to groundbreaking artists. He pushed John to write more honestly and introspectively, which was essential for the creation of seminal albums like *Rubber Soul* and *Revolver*. This shift elevated The Beatles beyond teen idols and directly influenced John's decision-making in the studio, encouraging him to experiment and prioritize lyrical depth over commercial formulas.","src/content/research/lennon-key-influential-characters.md","3cca4aa5598ef0fb",{html:2458,metadata:2459},"<h2 id=\"mimi-smith-aunt-and-guardian\"><strong>Mimi Smith</strong> (Aunt and Guardian)</h2>\n<h3 id=\"mimis-role-in-lennons-life\">Mimi’s Role in Lennon’s Life</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>His mother’s sister, Mimi, raised John from the age of five in her suburban Liverpool home, “Mendips.”</li>\n<li>She was his primary guardian and a stern, no-nonsense matriarch who provided the stability his chaotic childhood lacked.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"nature-of-mimis-influence\">Nature of Mimi’s Influence</h3>\n<p>Mimi was the <strong>anchor of pragmatism and discipline</strong> in his life.

She represented the world of convention and respectability that he both craved and rejected.</p>\n<h3 id=\"mimis-relationship-with-the-beatles--influence-on-lennons-decisions\">Mimi’s Relationship with The Beatles &#x26; Influence on Lennon’s Decisions</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Relationship:</strong> Mimi was present from the very beginning, watching the Quarrymen practice in her porch. She was fiercely protective of John but often dismissive of the band, viewing them as “John’s noisy friends.” She remained a grounding force in his life even at the height of Beatlemania.</li>\n<li><strong>Influence:</strong> Her influence was foundational. While she didn’t make business decisions, her skepticism fueled John’s ferocious ambition to prove her, and the world, wrong. His desire to escape the conventional life she represented was a primary driver in his quest for fame. In a way, his entire career was an argument with Mimi’s worldview.</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"julia-lennon-mother\"><strong>Julia Lennon</strong> (Mother)</h2>\n<h3 id=\"julias-role-in-lennons-life\">Julia’s Role in Lennon’s Life</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Julia was John’s biological mother. After giving him up to be raised by her sister, she re-entered his life during his teenage years.</li>\n<li>She was a free-spirited, vivacious, and musical figure who stood in stark contrast to the stern Mimi.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"nature-of-julias-influence\">Nature of Julia’s Influence</h3>\n<p>Julia was the <strong>artistic and emotional core</strong> of John’s life. She taught him his first banjo chords, introduced him to rock and roll, and encouraged his rebellious, creative spirit. Her sudden, tragic death—she was killed by a car driven by an off-duty police officer when John was 17—became the central trauma of his existence. This profound loss fueled his deepest art, from the tender “Julia” to the primal scream of “Mother,” and left him with a lifelong feeling of abandonment.</p>\n<h3 id=\"julias-relationship-with-the-beatles--influence-on-lennons-decisions\">Julia’s Relationship with The Beatles &#x26; Influence on Lennon’s Decisions</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Relationship:</strong> Julia was the <strong>spectral muse</strong> of The Beatles. She died before they achieved fame, but her memory was a constant presence. The band itself was, in part, a way for John to channel his grief and rage.</li>\n<li><strong>Influence:</strong> Her death created a psychological void that John desperately tried to fill. This shaped his intense, often codependent relationships and his search for a mother figure. His need to process this trauma drove much of his songwriting and, ultimately, his decision to undergo Primal Scream therapy, which resulted in his rawest and most personal solo album.</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"stuart-sutcliffe-the-lost-beatle--the-artist\">Stuart Sutcliffe (The Lost Beatle / The Artist)</h2>\n<h3 id=\"sutcliffes-role-in-lennons-life\">Sutcliffe’s Role in Lennon’s Life</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Sutcliffe was John’s best friend at Liverpool College of Art and the original bassist for The Beatles.</li>\n<li>He was a hugely talented and serious painter who was more dedicated to his art than to music.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"nature-of-sutcliffes-influence\">Nature of Sutcliffe’s Influence</h3>\n<p>Stu was John’s <strong>intellectual and aesthetic soulmate</strong>. Before Paul, Stu was John’s “other half.” He introduced John to a world of European art, literature, and existentialist philosophy. He was responsible for cultivating the early Beatles’ “look”—the leather jackets and the moody, rebellious “exi” (existentialist) image they adopted in Hamburg. He represented the ideal of the pure, uncompromising artist that John always admired and aspired to be.</p>\n<h3 id=\"sutcliffes-relationship-with-the-beatles--influence-on-lennons-decisions\">Sutcliffe’s Relationship with The Beatles &#x26; Influence on Lennon’s Decisions</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Relationship:</strong> As the original bassist, his connection was foundational. However, his decision to leave the band in 1961 to stay in Hamburg with his fiancée Astrid Kirchherr and pursue painting was a pivotal moment. His sudden death from a brain hemorrhage a year later was the first great tragedy the band endured together.</li>\n<li><strong>Influence:</strong> Stu’s departure directly led to Paul McCartney taking over on bass, solidifying the classic four-man lineup. More profoundly, his early death cemented him in John’s mind as a romantic, tragic figure—an artist who never “sold out.” This ideal of artistic purity, untainted by commercialism, was a standard John would later measure himself against, contributing to his own eventual disillusionment with Beatlemania.</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"bob-dylan-the-songwriting-guru\">Bob Dylan (The Songwriting Guru)</h2>\n<h3 id=\"dylans-role-in-lennons-life\">Dylan’s Role in Lennon’s Life</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>The iconic American folk singer was already a towering figure when The Beatles first met him in New York in 1964.</li>\n<li>He was not a personal friend but a powerful, distant artistic peer and rival.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"nature-of-dylans-influence\">Nature of Dylan’s Influence</h3>\n<p>Dylan was the <strong>catalyst for Lennon’s lyrical awakening</strong>. He shattered the conventions of the pop song for John. Dylan’s complex, surreal, and deeply personal lyrics gave Lennon “permission” to move beyond “I love you, yeah, yeah, yeah.” The influence was immediate and profound. Songs like “I’m a Loser” and “You’ve Got to Hide Your Love Away” are direct results of Lennon absorbing Dylan’s folk-inflected introspection. He showed John that a pop star could also be a serious poet.</p>\n<h3 id=\"dylans-relationship-with-the-beatles--influence-on-lennons-decisions\">Dylan’s Relationship with The Beatles &#x26; Influence on Lennon’s Decisions</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Relationship:</strong> Their relationship was one of mutual respect, intense competition, and a degree of wariness. They were the two most significant songwriters of their generation, constantly observing and reacting to each other’s work.</li>\n<li><strong>Influence:</strong> Dylan’s impact was a key factor in the band’s artistic evolution from a pop group to groundbreaking artists. He pushed John to write more honestly and introspectively, which was essential for the creation of seminal albums like <em>Rubber Soul</em> and <em>Revolver</em>. This shift elevated The Beatles beyond teen idols and directly influenced John’s decision-making in the studio, encouraging him to experiment and prioritize lyrical depth over commercial formulas.</li>\n</ul>",{headings:2460,localImagePaths:2509,remoteImagePaths:2510,frontmatter:2511,imagePaths:2514},[2461,2464,2467,2470,2473,2476,2479,2482,2485,2488,2491,2494,2497,2500,2503,2506],{depth:89,slug:2462,text:2463},"mimi-smith-aunt-and-guardian","Mimi Smith (Aunt and Guardian)",{depth:64,slug:2465,text:2466},"mimis-role-in-lennons-life","Mimi’s Role in Lennon’s Life",{depth:64,slug:2468,text:2469},"nature-of-mimis-influence","Nature of Mimi’s Influence",{depth:64,slug:2471,text:2472},"mimis-relationship-with-the-beatles--influence-on-lennons-decisions","Mimi’s Relationship with The Beatles & Influence on Lennon’s Decisions",{depth:89,slug:2474,text:2475},"julia-lennon-mother","Julia Lennon (Mother)",{depth:64,slug:2477,text:2478},"julias-role-in-lennons-life","Julia’s Role in Lennon’s Life",{depth:64,slug:2480,text:2481},"nature-of-julias-influence","Nature of Julia’s Influence",{depth:64,slug:2483,text:2484},"julias-relationship-with-the-beatles--influence-on-lennons-decisions","Julia’s Relationship with The Beatles & Influence on Lennon’s Decisions",{depth:89,slug:2486,text:2487},"stuart-sutcliffe-the-lost-beatle--the-artist","Stuart Sutcliffe (The Lost Beatle / The Artist)",{depth:64,slug:2489,text:2490},"sutcliffes-role-in-lennons-life","Sutcliffe’s Role in Lennon’s Life",{depth:64,slug:2492,text:2493},"nature-of-sutcliffes-influence","Nature of Sutcliffe’s Influence",{depth:64,slug:2495,text:2496},"sutcliffes-relationship-with-the-beatles--influence-on-lennons-decisions","Sutcliffe’s Relationship with The Beatles & Influence on Lennon’s Decisions",{depth:89,slug:2498,text:2499},"bob-dylan-the-songwriting-guru","Bob Dylan (The Songwriting Guru)",{depth:64,slug:2501,text:2502},"dylans-role-in-lennons-life","Dylan’s Role in Lennon’s Life",{depth:64,slug:2504,text:2505},"nature-of-dylans-influence","Nature of Dylan’s Influence",{depth:64,slug:2507,text:2508},"dylans-relationship-with-the-beatles--influence-on-lennons-decisions","Dylan’s Relationship with The Beatles & Influence on Lennon’s Decisions",[],[],{title:2445,category:1426,date_range:2446,reliability:1566,relevance:2447,tags:2512,created:2513},[1430,2449,2450,2451,2452,1496,2131],["Date","2025-07-24T00:00:00.000Z"],[],"lennon-key-influential-characters.md","lennon-quotes",{id:2516,data:2518,body:2524,filePath:2525,digest:2526,rendered:2527,legacyId:2550},{title:2519,category:1426,date_range:2520,reliability:1408,relevance:2521,tags:2522,created:2523},"John Lennon: Exhaustive Quote Compilation","1960–1980","To help capture John Lennon’s unique voice and way of speaking, gathered from interviews, writings, press conferences, and song lyrics—covering a spectrum of tone, philosophy, and wit.",[1430,2203,1799],["Date","2025-07-24T00:00:00.000Z"],"## Philosophical & Reflective Quotes\r\n\r\n- “You may say I'm a dreamer, but I'm not the only one.

He taught Paul to value melody, harmony, and proper song structure, drawn from the world of pre-rock show tunes and jazz standards. He instilled a sense of professionalism, politeness, and a \"get on with it\" attitude. This gave Paul a deep reservoir of traditional musicality and a diplomatic personality that would become crucial within the band.\r\n\r\n### Jim's Relationship with The Beatles & Influence on McCartney's Decisions\r\n\r\n* **Relationship:** Jim was a proud and supportive figure, famously suggesting Paul add the iconic line \"She's been a naughty girl, she's let her father down\" to \"She Loves You.\" He represented the older generation that The Beatles ultimately won over.\r\n* **Influence:** Jim's musical background gave Paul the tools to become the band's most versatile melodicist. While John pushed the band towards raw rock 'n' roll, Paul's grounding in his father's music allowed him to write timeless ballads (\"Yesterday\") and complex arrangements. His father’s emphasis on hard work made Paul the natural driving force in the studio.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## **Mary McCartney** (Mother)\r\n\r\n### Mary's Role in McCartney's Life\r\n\r\n* Paul's mother, a midwife and the family's primary breadwinner.\r\n* She died of an embolism following a battle with breast cancer when Paul was just 14 years old.\r\n\r\n### Nature of Mary's Influence\r\n\r\nMary's sudden death was the **defining trauma of Paul's adolescence**. This profound loss forged an immediate and powerful bond with John Lennon, who had also lost his mother. It fostered in Paul a deep-seated need to maintain harmony and hold things together, fearing further loss and fragmentation. She became a sainted, idealized memory that he carried with him.\r\n\r\n### Mary's Relationship with The Beatles & Influence on McCartney's Decisions\r\n\r\n* **Relationship:** As she passed away before the band's formation, her relationship was entirely posthumous, existing as a powerful memory and creative inspiration.\r\n* **Influence:** The shared trauma of losing their mothers was the initial, powerful glue in the Lennon-McCartney partnership. Years later, during the tense sessions for the White Album, Paul famously had a dream of his mother Mary, who gave him words of comfort. This dream directly inspired the lyrics and consoling tone of \"Let It Be,\" one of the band's most iconic and healing songs.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## **Jane Asher** (The London Muse)\r\n\r\n### Jane's Role in McCartney's Life\r\n\r\n* A successful child actress from a cultured, upper-middle-class London family, Jane was Paul's steady girlfriend from 1963 to 1968, during the height of Beatlemania.\r\n* Paul lived in the Asher family home on Wimpole Street for several years, which became his creative base in London.\r\n\r\n### Nature of Jane's Influence\r\n\r\nJane and her family were **Paul's gateway to the avant-garde and high culture**. They introduced him to a world of classical music, experimental theatre, art galleries, and intellectual society that was far removed from Liverpool. This was Paul's \"university,\" expanding his artistic palette beyond rock and pop and nurturing his curiosity for the experimental.\r\n\r\n### Jane's Relationship with The Beatles & Influence on McCartney's Decisions\r\n\r\n* **Relationship:** She was the most significant partner of a Beatle during their most creative period. While she maintained her own career, she was a direct inspiration for many of Paul's greatest songs, from \"And I Love Her\" to \"For No One.\"\r\n* **Influence:** Living with the Ashers directly fueled The Beatles' artistic leap. Paul's exposure to composers like Stockhausen and his immersion in London's art scene made him the primary driver behind the band's most ambitious projects, including *Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band*. His decision to push the band into more experimental and orchestrated territory was a direct result of the cultural education he received during this time.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## **Brian Epstein** (The Manager / The Architect)\r\n\r\n### Brian's Role in McCartney's Life\r\n\r\n* The Beatles' manager, who discovered them at the Cavern Club in 1961.\r\n* He was a sophisticated, driven, and impeccably organized figure who believed in the band's potential with unwavering faith.\r\n\r\n### Nature of Brian's Influence\r\n\r\nBrian was the **architect of The Beatles' professional success and public image**. He provided the structure, discipline, and direction that Paul's ambitious and orderly nature thrived on. He cleaned up their scruffy leather-clad image, put them in suits, and relentlessly secured their record contract with EMI. For Paul, Brian was a trusted mentor who made everything possible.\r\n\r\n### Brian's Relationship with The Beatles & Influence on McCartney's Decisions\r\n\r\n* **Relationship:** Brian was the band's father figure and their fiercest protector. He managed every aspect of their careers, allowing them to focus purely on the music.\r\n* **Influence:** Brian's sudden death in 1967 was a catastrophic turning point. It created a leadership vacuum that a terrified Paul felt compelled to fill to prevent the band from disintegrating. Paul's attempts to steer the group—by initiating projects like *Magical Mystery Tour*—were a direct response to Brian's absence. This shift in the group dynamic, with Paul perceived as \"the boss,\" created friction and resentment that contributed significantly to the band's eventual breakup.","src/content/research/mccartney-key-influential-characters.md","16289d230e6c688c",{html:2629,metadata:2630},"<h2 id=\"jim-mccartney-father\"><strong>Jim McCartney</strong> (Father)</h2>\n<h3 id=\"jims-role-in-mccartneys-life\">Jim’s Role in McCartney’s Life</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Paul’s father, a cotton salesman and talented amateur musician who led his own jazz band in the 1920s.</li>\n<li>He was the stable, encouraging, and pragmatic head of the McCartney household, providing a stark contrast to the chaos of John Lennon’s upbringing.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"nature-of-jims-influence\">Nature of Jim’s Influence</h3>\n<p>Jim was the <strong>source of Paul’s musical foundation and work ethic</strong>.

He cleaned up their scruffy leather-clad image, put them in suits, and relentlessly secured their record contract with EMI.

He managed every aspect of their careers, allowing them to focus purely on the music.</li>\n<li><strong>Influence:</strong> Brian’s sudden death in 1967 was a catastrophic turning point. It created a leadership vacuum that a terrified Paul felt compelled to fill to prevent the band from disintegrating. Paul’s attempts to steer the group—by initiating projects like <em>Magical Mystery Tour</em>—were a direct response to Brian’s absence. This shift in the group dynamic, with Paul perceived as “the boss,” created friction and resentment that contributed significantly to the band’s eventual breakup.</li>\n</ul>",{headings:2631,localImagePaths:2680,remoteImagePaths:2681,frontmatter:2682,imagePaths:2685},[2632,2635,2638,2641,2644,2647,2650,2653,2656,2659,2662,2665,2668,2671,2674,2677],{depth:89,slug:2633,text:2634},"jim-mccartney-father","Jim McCartney (Father)",{depth:64,slug:2636,text:2637},"jims-role-in-mccartneys-life","Jim’s Role in McCartney’s Life",{depth:64,slug:2639,text:2640},"nature-of-jims-influence","Nature of Jim’s Influence",{depth:64,slug:2642,text:2643},"jims-relationship-with-the-beatles--influence-on-mccartneys-decisions","Jim’s Relationship with The Beatles & Influence on McCartney’s Decisions",{depth:89,slug:2645,text:2646},"mary-mccartney-mother","Mary McCartney (Mother)",{depth:64,slug:2648,text:2649},"marys-role-in-mccartneys-life","Mary’s Role in McCartney’s Life",{depth:64,slug:2651,text:2652},"nature-of-marys-influence","Nature of Mary’s Influence",{depth:64,slug:2654,text:2655},"marys-relationship-with-the-beatles--influence-on-mccartneys-decisions","Mary’s Relationship with The Beatles & Influence on McCartney’s Decisions",{depth:89,slug:2657,text:2658},"jane-asher-the-london-muse","Jane Asher (The London Muse)",{depth:64,slug:2660,text:2661},"janes-role-in-mccartneys-life","Jane’s Role in McCartney’s Life",{depth:64,slug:2663,text:2664},"nature-of-janes-influence","Nature of Jane’s Influence",{depth:64,slug:2666,text:2667},"janes-relationship-with-the-beatles--influence-on-mccartneys-decisions","Jane’s Relationship with The Beatles & Influence on McCartney’s Decisions",{depth:89,slug:2669,text:2670},"brian-epstein-the-manager--the-architect","Brian Epstein (The Manager / The Architect)",{depth:64,slug:2672,text:2673},"brians-role-in-mccartneys-life","Brian’s Role in McCartney’s Life",{depth:64,slug:2675,text:2676},"nature-of-brians-influence","Nature of Brian’s Influence",{depth:64,slug:2678,text:2679},"brians-relationship-with-the-beatles--influence-on-mccartneys-decisions","Brian’s Relationship with The Beatles & Influence on McCartney’s Decisions",[],[],{title:2617,category:1426,date_range:2618,reliability:1566,relevance:2619,tags:2683,created:2684},[1695,2621,2622,2623,1604,1496,2131],["Date","2025-07-24T00:00:00.000Z"],[],"mccartney-key-influential-characters.md","mccartney-quotes",{id:2687,data:2689,body:2695,filePath:2696,digest:2697,rendered:2698,legacyId:2719},{title:2690,category:1426,date_range:2691,reliability:1408,relevance:2692,tags:2693,created:2694},"Paul McCartney: Exhaustive Quote Compilation","1960–Present","To help capture Paul McCartney's unique voice and way of speaking, gathered from interviews, writings, and song lyrics—focusing on his optimism, musical craftsmanship, and diplomatic nature.",[1695,2203,1799],["Date","2025-07-24T00:00:00.000Z"],"## Philosophical & Reflective Quotes\r\n\r\n- “And in the end, the love you take is equal to the love you make.”\r\n- “I used to think that anyone doing anything weird was weird.

From that day on, I was determined to get to the top of the Navy. It was a burning, searing ambition.”\r\n- “The right time to do a thing is when it has to be done.”\r\n- “I am a great believer in seeing the wood for the trees. I'm a great believer in trying to simplify things.”\r\n- “My great gift is to be able to accelerate the inevitable.”\r\n- “I can stand anything but being bored.”\r\n- “I believe that it is more important to be right than to be consistent.”\r\n\r\n## On Leadership, War, and Command\r\n\r\n- “There is no such thing as a born leader. Leadership is a skill, and like any skill, it can be taught and it can be learned.”\r\n- “The first duty of an officer is to get to know his men. His second duty is to see that they are happy and contented.”\r\n- “Keep a hand on the rudder, but don't try and steer the ship.”\r\n- *(On his command in Burma)*: \"I took a beaten army, and I turned it into a victorious army. It was probably the greatest thing I ever did.\"\r\n- “The more you sweat in peace, the less you bleed in war.”\r\n- “A commander must be a master of the art of persuasion.”\r\n\r\n## On The Royal Family and His Place Within It\r\n\r\n- *(To Prince Charles)*: “In a case like yours, the man should sow his wild oats and have as many affairs as he can before settling down, but for a wife he should choose a suitable, attractive and sweet-charactered girl before she has met anyone else she might fall for.”\r\n- *(On Philip's marriage to Elizabeth)*: \"The House of Mountbatten now reigns.\" (A claim that was swiftly and firmly corrected by Churchill and the Queen Mother).\r\n- “I am the Queen’s cousin. I am Prince Philip’s uncle. I am Prince Charles’s great-uncle. I am the last Viceroy of India. I am the first Sea Lord. I’ve done it all.”\r\n- “Listen, my boy, the art of being a king is to be able to make people love you.”\r\n- “I’m a sort of general adviser to the whole family.”\r\n\r\n## On Vanity, Legacy, and Self-Perception\r\n\r\n- “I have an ego. I admit it. But I hope it is a controlled ego.”\r\n- “I have a rule: never pass a staircase you can run up, and never pass a lavatory you can use.”\r\n- *(On his appearance)*: “I have the best pair of legs in the Navy.”\r\n- “I always wanted to be in the centre of things.”\r\n- “I’m just a simple sailor, you know.”\r\n- “My life has been a series of challenges. I’ve always been given the impossible jobs to do.”\r\n\r\n## On India, Partition, and Politics\r\n\r\n- *(On his role as Viceroy)*: “I was given an impossible job, and I think I did it as well as anyone could have done.”\r\n- “I know that my solution for the transfer of power in India will be judged harshly. But what was the alternative? Civil war on a scale that would have made the actual riots look like a children's tea party.”\r\n- “Every single thing I did in India was for the good of India.”\r\n- *(To Mahatma Gandhi)*: “Mr. Gandhi, you are a remarkable man. But you are a very difficult man to deal with.”\r\n- “The transfer of power was the most rewarding and the most heartbreaking period of my life.”\r\n- “I don't mind what you do, as long as you do it with style.”\r\n\r\n## Anecdotes & Famous Dicta\r\n\r\n- “I am the last Viceroy.”\r\n- “The truth is, I’m a very emotional man. I weep very easily.”\r\n- “My dear boy, you must never, never let your enemies see that they have got you down.”\r\n- “The great thing is to be a part of history, not just to read about it.”\r\n\r\n## Table: Quote Themes\r\n\r\n| Theme | Key Quotes |\r\n|---|---|\r\n| Burning Ambition | “My father was sacked...

His pronouncements are often sweeping and definitive.\r\n- **A Master Storyteller:** He framed every event as a dramatic narrative in which he played the heroic, decisive role. He was the star of his own epic.\r\n- **Name-Dropping as a Second Language:** He constantly and casually mentioned his connections to kings, queens, prime ministers, and generals to reinforce his own importance.\r\n- **Naval and Aristocratic Terminology:** His speech was peppered with nautical metaphors (\"rudder,\" \"ship\") and the casual authority of the British aristocracy (\"my dear boy\").\r\n- **Charm as a Weapon:** His voice is often incredibly charming, persuasive, and engaging. This charm was a tool he used expertly to disarm opponents and get his way.\r\n- **Underlying Ruthlessness:** Beneath the polished charm was a cold, pragmatic, and utterly ruthless operator. His advice and actions were almost always calculated to advance his own or his family's position.","src/content/research/mountbatten-quotes.md","0cf176bd5a1299f7",{html:2886,metadata:2887},"<h2 id=\"on-power-destiny-and-ambition\">On Power, Destiny, and Ambition</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>“My father was sacked in a brutal way.

The Metaphorical Significance: A Dance of Destruction**\r\n\r\nThe metaphor of the minuet—a slow, formal, and structured 18th-century court dance—is the key to its significance.\r\n\r\n* **Control vs. Chaos:** The minuet represents the values of the British establishment: order, tradition, precision, and control. This stands in stark contrast to The Beatles, who represent the chaotic, irreverent, and emotionally raw energy of the 1960s counter-culture. The operation is an attempt by the Old World to formally \"dance\" the New World into submission.\r\n* **Leading the Partner:** In the dance, Lord Mountbatten and Prince Philip are the lead partners, choreographing the steps. The Beatles are the unwitting followers, maneuvered into positions of paranoia (Paul), spiritual distraction (George), and creative isolation (John) without ever realizing they are being led.\r\n* **Aristocratic Detachment:** The name perfectly characterizes the conspirators.

The Dramatic and Ironic Payoff**\r\n\r\nThe name's greatest strength lies in how it sets up the story's pivotal turning point. A minuet requires both partners to follow the steps. The plan's success hinges on this.\r\n\r\n* **The Successful Failure (The Midpoint):** The operation succeeds in its goal—the band breaks up. However, it fails in its *true* purpose, which was to neutralize John Lennon and restore Philip's sense of control. By returning his MBE with a political statement, Lennon **breaks the choreography**. He refuses to be led, improvises his own defiant move, and throws the \"dance\" into disarray.\r\n* **Triggering the Escalation:** Philip's realization that the elegant, controlled \"Minuet\" has failed to silence Lennon is what pushes him over the edge. The perceived public humiliation forces him to abandon subtlety. The failure of the dance necessitates a far darker tune.\r\n* **From \"Minuet\" to \"Elegy\":** The shift in codenames is the story's most critical tonal shift. We move from a formal dance (a psychological game) to a funeral song (a murder plot). The name change itself signals that the rules have changed, the stakes are now life and death, and the story has descended from a clever thriller into a dark conspiracy.\r\n\r\nIn summary, \"Operation Minuet\" is the perfect title for the initial conspiracy.

From his early youth until well into his old age, he pursued blood sports with immense passion and skill around the globe. This lifelong activity ran parallel to his pioneering work in conservation, creating a public paradox that he frequently had to defend.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### A Foundational Upbringing and Lifelong Practice\r\n\r\n- Prince Philip was first taught to shoot as a young boy in Germany while staying with his brother-in-law, Berthold, Margrave of Baden, a keen huntsman. (Source: _Young Prince Philip: His Turbulent Early Life_ by Philip Eade).\r\n- Shooting parties, particularly for [pheasant](/research/animal-reference#pheasant) and [partridge](/research/animal-reference#partridge), were a core part of the Royal Family's annual calendar at estates like Sandringham in Norfolk and Balmoral in Scotland. Philip was the organizer and master of these shoots for decades. (Source: Numerous royal biographies and documentaries, including Gyles Brandreth's _Philip: An Intimate Portrait_).\r\n- The scale of shooting at Sandringham was immense. In a 13-year period from 1981 to 1994, it was reported that an estimated 30,000 [pheasants](/research/animal-reference#pheasant) were killed on the estate. Prince Philip himself was estimated to have shot over 10,000 [pheasants](/research/animal-reference#pheasant) personally at Sandringham by the late 1980s. (Source: _The Independent_, reporting on figures compiled by Animal Aid, 1994).\r\n- Even in his final years, his passion remained. In 2011, at the age of 90, he was reportedly seen shooting [pheasants](/research/animal-reference#pheasant) at Sandringham just days after undergoing heart surgery. (Source: _The Telegraph_, December 2011).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### He Hunted a Vast and Global Variety of Game\r\n\r\n- **UK Game:** His primary quarry in the United Kingdom included [red grouse](/research/animal-reference#red-grouse), [partridge](/research/animal-reference#partridge), and [pheasants](/research/animal-reference#pheasant) (on shooting estates) and [red deer](/research/animal-reference#red-deer) stags (stalking at Balmoral). (Source: General royal reporting, BBC documentaries).\r\n- **Wild Boar:** He hunted [wild boar](/research/animal-reference#wild-boar) in Germany on numerous occasions throughout his life, continuing the tradition from his youth. (Source: _Philip: An Intimate Portrait_ by Gyles Brandreth).\r\n- **Tiger:** In 1961, during a royal tour of India, Prince Philip shot and killed a large male [tiger](/research/animal-reference#tiger) in Ranthambore National Park while a guest of the Maharajah of Jaipur. The Queen accompanied him and photographed the hunt. (Source: Widely documented in news archives, including the BBC and Associated Press; featured prominently in documentaries like Netflix's _The Crown_).\r\n- **Crocodile:** During a 1957 royal tour of The Gambia, he shot a 12-foot [crocodile](/research/animal-reference#crocodile) from a dugout canoe on the Gambia River. A famous photograph exists of him standing over the kill. (Source: Photo archives of Getty Images, Associated Press).\r\n- **Wild Sheep:** He hunted [Marco Polo sheep](/research/animal-reference#marco-polo-sheep), a species of argali, in the Himalayas. (Source: _Philip and Elizabeth: Portrait of a Royal Marriage_ by Gyles Brandreth).\r\n- **Other Game:** Over his lifetime, his quarry also reportedly included [quail](/research/animal-reference#quail), [wild duck](/research/animal-reference#wild-duck), [snipe](/research/animal-reference#snipe), [puffins](/research/animal-reference#puffin), [rabbits](/research/animal-reference#rabbit), and various other animals across the Commonwealth and beyond.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### His Hunting Created Significant Public Controversy\r\n\r\n- **The 1961 India Tiger Hunt:** This incident is the most infamous. It occurred just weeks before Philip was set to become the first president of the World Wildlife Fund's (WWF) UK appeal. The timing was disastrous, creating headlines worldwide and accusations of blatant hypocrisy that would follow him for the rest of his life. (Source: _The Guardian_ and other international news archives from 1961).\r\n- **The WWF Presidency Paradox:** Prince Philip was a co-founder of the WWF in 1961 and served as its international president from 1981 to 1996. He consistently defended his passion for shooting alongside his conservation work.\r\n- **His Justification:** He argued that \"culling\" was an essential part of conservation to manage populations and prevent starvation. A famous quote summarizes his view: \"I think that there is a difference between being a conservationist and an animal lover... you can be a naturalist and a hunter at the same time.\" He distinguished between the regulated hunting of game species and the illegal poaching of endangered ones. (Source: _The Guardian_, quoting his own writings and interviews, April 2021).\r\n- **Family Disagreements:** It was reported in later years that he clashed with his grandson, Prince William, over conservation issues, particularly William's desire to destroy the royal ivory collection. Philip reportedly \"berated\" William, arguing the collection had historical value. (Source: _Daily Mail_, reporting on the book _Charles & The Queen_, 2015).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### The Passion Was Deeply Personal and Part of His Identity\r\n\r\n- For Prince Philip, hunting was more than a sport; it was a connection to nature, a test of skill, and a way of life he saw as practical and unsentimental. Gyles Brandreth, his biographer and confidant, noted that Philip saw farming and game management as two sides of the same coin: managing livestock for a purpose.\r\n- He saw the \"antis\" (anti-hunting protestors) as sentimental town-dwellers who did not understand the countryside or the realities of wildlife management. (Source: _Philip: An Intimate Portrait_ by Gyles Brandreth).\r\n- His final public request regarding his funeral arrangements was to be driven to St. George's Chapel in a custom-built Land Rover Defender he had helped design, painted in military \"dark bronze green\"—a color synonymous with his practical, country-based, and outdoors-focused life.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Further Incidents and Public Reactions\r\n\r\n### The Spanish Ibex Controversy (1964)\r\n\r\n- **Details:** In 1964, while on a private trip to Spain as a guest of his cousins, Prince Philip shot a rare [Spanish Ibex](/research/animal-reference#spanish-ibex). At the time, this subspecies of wild goat was protected, and hunting it was strictly controlled.\r\n- **Context:** The World Wildlife Fund (WWF), with Philip as its UK President, was actively campaigning to save the [Spanish Ibex](/research/animal-reference#spanish-ibex) from extinction. His participation in the hunt was seen as a profound betrayal of the organization's mission.\r\n- **Source:** This incident was reported in various international newspapers at the time, including Spanish and British press, and is often cited by biographers and critics.\r\n\r\n### Deer Stalking at Balmoral: A Royal Tradition\r\n\r\n- **Role as Mentor:** Prince Philip was instrumental in teaching the craft of stalking [red deer](/research/animal-reference#red-deer) to his children, particularly Prince Charles, and later to his grandsons, William and Harry.\r\n- **The Practice:** Stalking is a physically demanding form of hunting that involves tracking a specific stag over many miles of difficult, hilly terrain. Philip, known for his physical fitness, excelled at it and saw it as a key part of the royal family's connection to Scotland.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Summary Table of Reported Kills\r\n\r\n| Animal                                                      | Reported Number                                     |\r\n| :---------------------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------- |\r\n| **[Pheasants](/research/animal-reference#pheasant)**        | Over 10,000 (Sandringham) / 30,000 (lifetime brag)  |\r\n| **[Partridges](/research/animal-reference#partridge)**      | 500 (in a single day) / \"thousands\" (lifetime brag) |\r\n| **[Pigeons](/research/animal-reference#pigeon)**            | \"thousands\" (lifetime brag)                         |\r\n| **[Rabbits](/research/animal-reference#rabbit)**            | \"thousands\" (lifetime brag)                         |\r\n| **[Wild Duck](/research/animal-reference#wild-duck)**       | 98 (in a single trip)                               |\r\n| **[Tiger](/research/animal-reference#tiger)**               | 1                                                   |\r\n| **[Crocodile](/research/animal-reference#crocodile)**       | At least 1                                          |\r\n| **[Spanish Ibex](/research/animal-reference#spanish-ibex)** | At least 1                                          |\r\n| **[Puffins](/research/animal-reference#puffin)**            | An unspecified number                               |\r\n\r\nIt is important to note that many of these figures, particularly the larger lifetime estimates, originate from animal rights groups and critical press coverage, while specific day-hunt numbers come from contemporary news reports.","src/content/research/phillip-hunting-obsession.mdx","2059bc16870ec169","phillip-hunting-obsession.mdx","phillip-key-influencial-characters",{id:2973,data:2975,body:2985,filePath:2986,digest:2987,rendered:2988,legacyId:3046},{title:2976,category:1426,date_range:2977,reliability:1566,relevance:2978,tags:2979,created:2984},"Influential Figures in the Life of Prince Philip","1921–1947","Explores the key figures who shaped Prince Philip’s character and influenced his suitability as consort to Queen Elizabeth II.",[2965,2980,2981,2982,2983,1496,2131],"Mountbatten","Kurt Hahn","Princess Alice","Prince Andrew",["Date","2025-07-24T00:00:00.000Z"],"## **Lord Louis \"Dickie\" Mountbatten** (Uncle and Mentor)\r\n\r\n### Dickie's Role in Philip's Life\r\n\r\n- As Philip's maternal uncle, Lord Mountbatten became the primary adult male figure and surrogate father in his life after Philip's own father became estranged.\r\n- He was an ambitious and powerful naval commander who meticulously guided Philip's education and career in the Royal Navy.\r\n- He acted as the royal matchmaker, famously engineering the pivotal meeting between a young Princess Elizabeth and the 18-year-old naval cadet Philip in 1939.\r\n\r\n### Nature of Dickie's Influence\r\n\r\nMountbatten provided the **ambition and direction** that was absent from Philip's chaotic childhood. He gave Philip a sense of belonging within the powerful Mountbatten clan and a clear path forward. Philip learned from him about strategy, naval tradition, and how to navigate the complex world of the British establishment. However, Mountbatten's relentless ambition for his own family name meant his guidance was often self-serving, a fact Philip was keenly aware of. This relationship forged Philip’s drive but also a certain cynicism about the motives of others.\r\n\r\n### Dickie's Relationship with the British Crown & Influence on the Marriage\r\n\r\n- **Relationship:** As a great-grandson of Queen Victoria and a senior Royal Navy officer, Mountbatten was a **consummate royal insider**. His career and status were intrinsically linked to the Crown. After the marriage, his influence soared, eventually becoming First Sea Lord.\r\n- **Influence on Marriage:** His influence was **paramount and strategic**. He saw Philip's marriage to the heir as the ultimate dynastic victory for the Mountbatten family. He actively lobbied King George VI, neutralized opposition from courtiers who disliked Philip's \"foreign\" background, and coached Philip on how to present himself. For Mountbatten, the marriage wasn't just a personal match; it was a political and dynastic maneuver which he orchestrated from start to finish.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## **Kurt Hahn** (Educator and Philosopher)\r\n\r\n### Hahn's Role in Philip's Life\r\n\r\n- Hahn was the German-Jewish founder and headmaster of Gordonstoun, the famously spartan boarding school in Scotland where Philip was sent as a teenager.\r\n- He was a pioneering educator who believed that developing character was more important than rote learning.\r\n\r\n### Nature of Hahn's Influence\r\n\r\nHahn was the **architect of Philip's personal philosophy**. His school's ethos, summarized by its motto \"Plus est en vous\" (\"There is more in you\"), was built on self-reliance, physical hardship, responsibility, and service to the community. This experience was profoundly formative for the young, displaced prince. It instilled in him a lifelong belief in duty, resilience, and the value of challenging oneself. The Duke of Edinburgh's Award, Philip's greatest personal legacy, is a direct application of Kurt Hahn's educational principles.\r\n\r\n### Hahn's Relationship with the British Crown & Influence on the Marriage\r\n\r\n- **Relationship:** Hahn had no direct blood ties to the Crown, but as the educator of many aristocratic sons, he was a highly respected figure within the establishment. His relationship with the Crown was cemented *through Philip* after the marriage, particularly with the founding of the Duke of Edinburgh's award.\r\n- **Influence on Marriage:** His influence was **indirect but crucial**. While Hahn had no say in the decision, the character he forged in Philip at Gordonstoun made him a far more acceptable candidate. Hahn molded a rootless boy into a man defined by duty, resilience, and leadership—qualities King George VI came to admire greatly. He made Philip a man the King could entrust his daughter to, overcoming concerns about his turbulent background.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## **Princess Alice of Battenberg** (Mother)\r\n\r\n### Alice's Role in Philip's Life\r\n\r\n- His mother, who was born congenitally deaf, suffered from severe mental health crises and was institutionalized for much of Philip's childhood.\r\n- In her later years, she found deep spiritual purpose, becoming a Greek Orthodox nun and being honored as \"Righteous Among the Nations\" for sheltering a Jewish family during the Nazi occupation.\r\n\r\n### Nature of Alice's Influence\r\n\r\nPrincess Alice's life had a **complex and dual influence**. Her absence during his youth forced upon him a premature and hardened self-sufficiency. However, her incredible courage, deep piety, and ultimate dedication to selfless service provided a powerful, if distant, moral example of a different, more spiritual form of duty.\r\n\r\n### Alice's Relationship with the British Crown & Influence on the Marriage\r\n\r\n- **Relationship:** Princess Alice's connection was **direct and vital**. She was born at Windsor Castle, a great-granddaughter of Queen Victoria. Her British royal blood was impeccable. In her final years, she lived at Buckingham Palace at the invitation of the Queen.\r\n- **Influence on Marriage:** Her lineage was a **major asset**. It provided Philip with an unimpeachable link to the British monarchy, helping to counteract his Greek title and the \"foreign\" label used by his detractors. While she played no active role in arranging the match, her very existence as a British princess by birth helped legitimize Philip's position and made the marriage far more palatable to the establishment and the public.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## **Prince Andrew of Greece and Denmark** (Father)\r\n\r\n### Andrew's Role in Philip's Life\r\n\r\n- His father was a professional soldier who was court-martialed and exiled from Greece following a disastrous military defeat in 1922.\r\n- He became estranged from his wife and children, living out most of his life in the South of France, largely detached from Philip's upbringing.\r\n\r\n### Nature of Andrew's Influence\r\n\r\nPrince Andrew served primarily as a **negative role model**. His life in exile, perceived by Philip as one of aimlessness and dereliction of family duty, was everything Philip resolved not to be. The perceived failure of his father instilled in Philip a powerful drive for purpose and a fierce commitment to his own responsibilities.\r\n\r\n### Andrew's Relationship with the British Crown & Influence on the Marriage\r\n\r\n- **Relationship:** As a member of the Greek and Danish royal houses, he was distantly related to the British Crown, but he was an outsider with a tarnished reputation. He died in 1944, before the marriage was officially agreed upon.\r\n- **Influence on Marriage:** His influence was almost entirely **negative**. He represented the \"baggage\" that worried the King and courtiers. His exile and detachment from the family were seen as liabilities and points against Philip's suitability as a consort. The marriage was approved *in spite of* Prince Andrew's background. Philip’s success was in overcoming the shadow of his father’s reputation, a feat made possible by his own distinguished naval service and the powerful backing of Lord Mountbatten.","src/content/research/phillip-key-influencial-characters.md","c06766df63f6e329",{html:2989,metadata:2990},"<h2 id=\"lord-louis-dickie-mountbatten-uncle-and-mentor\"><strong>Lord Louis “Dickie” Mountbatten</strong> (Uncle and Mentor)</h2>\n<h3 id=\"dickies-role-in-philips-life\">Dickie’s Role in Philip’s Life</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>As Philip’s maternal uncle, Lord Mountbatten became the primary adult male figure and surrogate father in his life after Philip’s own father became estranged.</li>\n<li>He was an ambitious and powerful naval commander who meticulously guided Philip’s education and career in the Royal Navy.</li>\n<li>He acted as the royal matchmaker, famously engineering the pivotal meeting between a young Princess Elizabeth and the 18-year-old naval cadet Philip in 1939.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"nature-of-dickies-influence\">Nature of Dickie’s Influence</h3>\n<p>Mountbatten provided the <strong>ambition and direction</strong> that was absent from Philip’s chaotic childhood.

He was a naval officer, and it shows in his concise, command-like phrasing.\r\n- **Dry, Caustic Wit:** His humor is rarely warm. It's sharp, sarcastic, and often at someone else's expense. It’s a tool to puncture pomposity or awkwardness.\r\n- **Unsentimental Pragmatism:** He approaches topics logically and practically, whether it's the monarchy, conservation, or family. He avoids emotional or sentimental language.\r\n- **The Voice of a Bygone Era:** Many of his most famous \"gaffes\" are simply expressions of a worldview and vocabulary common for a man of his class and generation but jarring to modern ears.\r\n- **Undercurrent of Restlessness:** There's often a sense of a highly intelligent and energetic man constrained by a purely ceremonial role, which comes out in his more provocative or frustrated remarks.","src/content/research/phillip-quotes.md","0f2cbba84b919992",{html:3059,metadata:3060},"<h2 id=\"philosophical--reflective-quotes\">Philosophical &#x26; Reflective Quotes</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>“It’s a complete misconception to imagine that the monarchy exists in the interests of the monarch.

I do not give you laws or administer justice but I can do something else: I can give my heart and my devotion to these old islands and to all the peoples of our brotherhood of nations.”\r\n- “It has been a privilege to have been alive during part of your lives.”\r\n- “The path, of course, is not always smooth, and may at times this year have felt quite bumpy, but small steps can make a world of difference.”\r\n- “When peace comes, remember it will be for us, the children of today, to make the world of tomorrow a better and happier place.”\r\n- “We will meet again.” (From her 2020 COVID-19 broadcast)\r\n\r\n## Philosophical & Reflective Quotes\r\n\r\n- “Grief is the price we pay for love.”\r\n- “It has always been easy to hate and destroy. To build and to cherish is much more difficult.”\r\n- “The world is not the most pleasant place. Eventually, your parents leave you and nobody is going to go out of their way to protect you. You have to learn to stand up for yourself and what you believe in.”\r\n- “Good memories are our second chance at happiness.”\r\n- “We may hold different points of view but it is in times of stress and difficulty that we most need to remember that we have much more in common than there is dividing us.”\r\n- “Perhaps we make too much of what is wrong and too little of what is right.”\r\n\r\n## Dry Wit, Humor, and Understated Irony\r\n\r\n- *(To G7 leaders at a photoshoot)*: “Are you supposed to be looking as if you're enjoying yourselves?”\r\n- *(To a courtier who suggested she should wear gloves to a garden party)*: “I can't possibly. I might have to clap.”\r\n- *(To her private secretary after a long, flattering speech by a politician)*: “I am glad he thinks I am wonderful. But he has rather gone on, hasn't he?”\r\n- *(On seeing a portrait of herself she disliked)*: \"Yes, it's a very nice frame.\"\r\n- *(When her cousin complained about the noise of Concorde flying over her house)*: \"It is a noise. But it's a friendly noise. It's the noise of people going somewhere.\"\r\n\r\n## On Family & Personal Life\r\n\r\n- *(On Prince Philip)*: “He has, quite simply, been my strength and stay all these years, and I, and his whole family, and this and many other countries, owe him a debt greater than he would ever claim, or we shall ever know.”\r\n- *(The Annus Horribilis speech, 1992)*: “1992 is not a year on which I shall look back with undiluted pleasure. In the words of one of my more sympathetic correspondents, it has turned out to be an 'Annus Horribilis'.”\r\n- “Like all the best families, we have our share of eccentricities, of impetuous and wayward youngsters and of family disagreements.”\r\n- “To be a grandmother is to experience a new dimension of love.”\r\n- “Let us not take ourselves too seriously. None of us has a monopoly on wisdom.”\r\n\r\n## On the Monarchy & The Commonwealth\r\n\r\n- “I have to be seen to be believed.”\r\n- “The function of the monarchy is to personify the state. It's the focus of loyalty, and it gives a sense of continuity.”\r\n- “The Commonwealth is not an empire in reverse. It is a new conception, built on the highest qualities of the spirit of man: friendship, loyalty, and the desire for freedom and peace.”\r\n- “We are a moderate, pragmatic people, more comfortable with practice than with theory.”\r\n- “Some cultures believe a long life brings wisdom. I'd like to think so. Perhaps part of that wisdom is to recognize some of life's baffling paradoxes.”\r\n\r\n## Anecdotes & Reported Remarks\r\n\r\n- *(To American tourists near Balmoral who didn't recognize her and asked if she'd ever met the Queen)*: “No, but he has.” (Pointing to her protection officer.)\r\n- *(To a former bodyguard who was walking with her when she was unrecognized)*: A group of tourists asked, \"Are you the Queen?\" She replied, \"Well, I look like the Queen.\"\r\n- *(On cutting a cake with a ceremonial sword)*: When told there was a knife she could use, she replied, \"I know there is.

Career and Relationship with George Harrison\r\n\r\nLong before his association with The Beatles, Ravi Shankar was one of the most famous Indian musicians in the world. A master of the sitar and a proponent of Hindustani classical music, he began touring Europe and the Americas in the 1950s, collaborating with classical musicians like violinist Yehudi Menuhin.\r\n\r\n* **Pre-Beatles Stature:** He was a serious artist who performed in concert halls, not pop venues. His goal was to bring deep respect and understanding to Indian music in the West.\r\n* **Meeting George Harrison (1966):** After George first used a sitar on \"Norwegian Wood\" (1965), he sought out a true master. They were introduced in London in June 1966. Shankar was initially wary of the pop star, but was won over by George's humility, sincerity, and genuine desire to learn.\r\n* **The Guru-Shishya Relationship:** Their bond was that of a traditional Indian teacher (guru) and disciple (shishya). It was based on immense discipline, respect, and spiritual practice. Shankar taught George in England and later at his home in India. This was not a casual jam session; it was a rigorous, all-encompassing education in music and philosophy.\r\n\r\n## 2. Musical and Spiritual Philosophy\r\n\r\nShankar's entire life was dedicated to the purity and sanctity of his art form. His philosophy was the polar opposite of the instant gratification of pop music.\r\n\r\n* **Music as Spirituality:** For Shankar, music was a form of prayer, a spiritual path (*sadhana*) to connect with the divine. It was a sacred tradition passed down through generations.\r\n* **Discipline and Tradition:** He was a staunch traditionalist who believed in years of arduous practice and complete devotion to one's guru. He saw the structure and rules of the raga system as a framework for spiritual freedom, not a limitation.\r\n* **Cultural Guardian:** He felt a profound responsibility to protect his culture from being cheapened or misunderstood in the West. He was an ambassador, but also a gatekeeper.\r\n\r\n## 3. Views on Western Counter-Culture\r\n\r\nWhile the counter-culture movement embraced Shankar as a figurehead, the feeling was not mutual. He was deeply troubled by the \"hippie\" movement and its superficial adoption of Indian culture.\r\n\r\n* **Disdain for Drug Culture:** Shankar was appalled that his music was being used as a background for drug trips. He believed that the clarity needed for appreciating the music was the exact opposite of what psychedelic drugs provided.\r\n* **The Monterey Pop Festival (1967):** His performance at Monterey was a key turning point. He was horrified by the atmosphere, culminating in Jimi Hendrix setting his guitar on fire. He felt it was a sacrilegious spectacle and that the audience was not truly listening to or respecting his music. He later said, \"That was the day I decided I would never play in a pop festival again.\" (Though he did play Woodstock).\r\n* **Superficial Appropriation:** He was pained by the sight of young people with cheap, poorly-made sitars, beads, and incense, believing they were adopting the aesthetics of India without any of the underlying spiritual discipline or respect.\r\n\r\n## 4. The Concert for Bangladesh (1971): A Culmination\r\n\r\nThis event represents the true culmination of the Shankar-Harrison relationship. It transformed their private musical and spiritual bond into a global force for good.\r\n\r\n* **Shankar's Initiative:** The concert was Shankar's idea. Distraught by the humanitarian crisis caused by the Bhola cyclone and the Bangladesh Liberation War, he approached George—the one person he knew with the global reach to help.\r\n* **A Higher Purpose:** This was not about pop music or fame; it was a humanitarian appeal. George leveraged his \"Beatle\" status and connections to organize the first-ever large-scale rock benefit concert.\r\n* **Vindication of Influence:** The concert demonstrated the true nature of Shankar's influence on George. He had not led him to self-indulgence or radical politics, but to compassion and selfless action. It was the purest expression of using one's art and fame in service to others.\r\n\r\n## 5. Narrative Significance for the Screenplay\r\n\r\nRavi Shankar is the embodiment of an authentic spiritual path that a paranoid, political establishment would be fundamentally incapable of understanding.\r\n\r\n* **The \"Foreign Handler\":** From a surveillance perspective, Shankar's actions fit a suspicious profile: a foreign national takes a major British cultural figure under his wing, isolates him in India, and instills in him a philosophy alien to Western norms. The Committee would see indoctrination, not education.\r\n* **A Comprehension Gap:** The entire basis of Shankar's philosophy—discipline, tradition, spirituality, duty—is the antithesis of the chaotic, rebellious counter-culture the establishment fears. Yet, because he is visually associated with that movement, a conspiracy would conflate the two, seeing him as the \"high priest\" of the whole phenomenon.\r\n* **The Ultimate Red Herring:** His true purpose is so noble and apolitical that it makes the conspiracy's interpretation of him seem utterly foolish in hindsight. The Concert for Bangladesh is an act so far beyond their cynical worldview that it retroactively exposes the absurdity of their suspicions. He is the authentic force that proves the conspiracy's theories bankrupt.","src/content/research/shankar-career-and-context.md","973cbb13d3b24f2d",{html:3392,metadata:3393},"<h2 id=\"1-career-and-relationship-with-george-harrison\">1.

He saw the structure and rules of the raga system as a framework for spiritual freedom, not a limitation.</li>\n<li><strong>Cultural Guardian:</strong> He felt a profound responsibility to protect his culture from being cheapened or misunderstood in the West. He was an ambassador, but also a gatekeeper.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"3-views-on-western-counter-culture\">3. Views on Western Counter-Culture</h2>\n<p>While the counter-culture movement embraced Shankar as a figurehead, the feeling was not mutual. He was deeply troubled by the “hippie” movement and its superficial adoption of Indian culture.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Disdain for Drug Culture:</strong> Shankar was appalled that his music was being used as a background for drug trips. He believed that the clarity needed for appreciating the music was the exact opposite of what psychedelic drugs provided.</li>\n<li><strong>The Monterey Pop Festival (1967):</strong> His performance at Monterey was a key turning point. He was horrified by the atmosphere, culminating in Jimi Hendrix setting his guitar on fire. He felt it was a sacrilegious spectacle and that the audience was not truly listening to or respecting his music. He later said, “That was the day I decided I would never play in a pop festival again.” (Though he did play Woodstock).</li>\n<li><strong>Superficial Appropriation:</strong> He was pained by the sight of young people with cheap, poorly-made sitars, beads, and incense, believing they were adopting the aesthetics of India without any of the underlying spiritual discipline or respect.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"4-the-concert-for-bangladesh-1971-a-culmination\">4. The Concert for Bangladesh (1971): A Culmination</h2>\n<p>This event represents the true culmination of the Shankar-Harrison relationship. It transformed their private musical and spiritual bond into a global force for good.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Shankar’s Initiative:</strong> The concert was Shankar’s idea. Distraught by the humanitarian crisis caused by the Bhola cyclone and the Bangladesh Liberation War, he approached George—the one person he knew with the global reach to help.</li>\n<li><strong>A Higher Purpose:</strong> This was not about pop music or fame; it was a humanitarian appeal. George leveraged his “Beatle” status and connections to organize the first-ever large-scale rock benefit concert.</li>\n<li><strong>Vindication of Influence:</strong> The concert demonstrated the true nature of Shankar’s influence on George. He had not led him to self-indulgence or radical politics, but to compassion and selfless action. It was the purest expression of using one’s art and fame in service to others.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"5-narrative-significance-for-the-screenplay\">5. Narrative Significance for the Screenplay</h2>\n<p>Ravi Shankar is the embodiment of an authentic spiritual path that a paranoid, political establishment would be fundamentally incapable of understanding.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>The “Foreign Handler”:</strong> From a surveillance perspective, Shankar’s actions fit a suspicious profile: a foreign national takes a major British cultural figure under his wing, isolates him in India, and instills in him a philosophy alien to Western norms. The Committee would see indoctrination, not education.</li>\n<li><strong>A Comprehension Gap:</strong> The entire basis of Shankar’s philosophy—discipline, tradition, spirituality, duty—is the antithesis of the chaotic, rebellious counter-culture the establishment fears. Yet, because he is visually associated with that movement, a conspiracy would conflate the two, seeing him as the “high priest” of the whole phenomenon.</li>\n<li><strong>The Ultimate Red Herring:</strong> His true purpose is so noble and apolitical that it makes the conspiracy’s interpretation of him seem utterly foolish in hindsight. The Concert for Bangladesh is an act so far beyond their cynical worldview that it retroactively exposes the absurdity of their suspicions. He is the authentic force that proves the conspiracy’s theories bankrupt.</li>\n</ul>",{headings:3394,localImagePaths:3408,remoteImagePaths:3409,frontmatter:3410,imagePaths:3413},[3395,3398,3401,3404,3407],{depth:89,slug:3396,text:3397},"1-career-and-relationship-with-george-harrison","1.

It served as a kind of mantra or rallying cry for the band during their formative years in Liverpool and Hamburg (roughly 1960-1962).\r\n\r\n* **Meaning:** It was a simple, almost childishly optimistic declaration of their ultimate goal: to reach the very top of the pop music world. It was their version of \"we're gonna be bigger than Elvis.\" The playful, rhyming nature of the phrase (\"toppermost,\" \"poppermost\") captures their youthful, slightly goofy confidence.\r\n\r\n* **Originator:** While all the Beatles used it, it is most famously attributed to John Lennon. It reflects his love of wordplay and nonsense language, a trait that would later define his books (*In His Own Write*) and many of his song lyrics.\r\n\r\n* **Context of Use:** John would often ask the others, \"Where are we going, fellas?\" The required response was, \"To the toppermost of the poppermost, Johnny!\" This call-and-response ritual served to reaffirm their shared ambition and boost morale during the grueling, often dispiriting days of playing long hours in rough clubs for little pay.\r\n\r\n### 2. The Psychology Behind the Phrase\r\n\r\nUnderstanding the psychology of the phrase is key to using it effectively in the screenplay.\r\n\r\n* **An In-Group Ritual:** This was *their* phrase. It was part of the private language that bonded them as a gang before they became a global brand. It was a secret handshake, a sign of belonging.\r\n\r\n* **Manifesting Destiny:** It was more than just a joke; it was an act of collective will. In the face of constant rejection and grueling work, repeating this mantra was a way of manifesting their own success. They believed in it with the unshakeable confidence of youth.\r\n\r\n* **Innocence and Ambition:** The phrase perfectly captures the duality of the early Beatles. It is both charmingly naive (\"poppermost\") and fiercely ambitious (\"toppermost\"). It represents a time before the cynicism and weariness of global fame set in.\r\n\r\n### 3. Usage in Your Screenplay: \"To the Toppermost\" Scene\r\n\r\nYour use of the phrase in Scene 5 is **perfectly placed and thematically resonant.**\r\n\r\n* **Dramatic Irony:** By late 1965, they have *achieved* the \"toppermost of the poppermost.\" They've conquered America, they're getting medals from the Queen. Using the phrase here serves as a poignant, slightly nostalgic callback to their simpler, hungrier days. It's a toast to a goal they've already surpassed.\r\n\r\n* **Character Dynamics:**\r\n  * **John's Leadership:** Having John be the one to reintroduce the phrase reinforces his role as the band's original leader and dreamer.\r\n  * **Papering Over Cracks:** After the brief, tense moment with George, John uses their old rallying cry to pull the group back together. It's an instinctive move to restore the \"gang\" mentality and paper over the newly exposed cracks of individual frustration.

He is intrigued by her piece \"Ceiling Painting/Y E S Painting,\" which requires climbing a ladder to see the word \"YES\" through a magnifying glass. They are formally introduced.\r\n* **Cynthia's Awareness:** **None.** Cynthia was not present. John later described the event to her, portraying Yoko as a \"weirdo\" artist and the event as a curiosity. At this stage, Cynthia perceives Yoko as just another eccentric figure in London's art scene, not a personal threat.\r\n\r\n### **Late 1966 – Late 1967: The Intellectual Courtship**\r\n\r\n* **Event:** Yoko begins a persistent campaign to contact John. She calls their home in Kenwood repeatedly and sends him a series of cryptic, conceptual \"art\" pieces and notes (e.g., a broken cup meticulously repaired, with a note about repairing it). John is both annoyed and fascinated. In October 1967, he secretly provides half the funding (£5,000) for her \"Half-A-Wind Show\" at the Lisson Gallery.\r\n* **Cynthia's Awareness:** **Partial and Dismissive.** Cynthia was aware of the phone calls and the strange packages arriving at their home. According to her memoirs, she found them intrusive and annoying. She saw Yoko as a persistent and strange \"groupie\" or \"hanger-on,\" but still did not view her as a romantic rival. She was completely unaware of John's financial backing of Yoko's art show.\r\n\r\n### **February 1968: The Trip to India**\r\n\r\n* **Event:** The Beatles and their partners, including John and Cynthia, travel to Rishikesh, India, to study Transcendental Meditation with the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi. During this time, John and Yoko maintain contact through correspondence. John receives daily letters from Yoko, which he eagerly awaits and reads in private. His obsession deepens.\r\n* **Cynthia's Awareness:** **Growing Suspicion.** Cynthia was aware that John was receiving letters but did not know their full content or the intensity of the correspondence. She notes in \"John\" that he became more distant and secretive during this period. The trip, meant to bring clarity, instead created a deeper emotional chasm between them. The idea of Yoko as more than just an eccentric fan begins to form, but it's still a vague unease, not a certainty.\r\n\r\n### **May 19, 1968: The Point of No Return**\r\n\r\n* **Event:** With Cynthia away on a pre-planned holiday in Greece with friends, John invites Yoko to his home, Kenwood. Fueled by drugs and creative energy, they spend the night recording experimental sound collages that would become the *Two Virgins* album. They consummate their relationship at dawn.\r\n* **Cynthia's Awareness:** **None.** She is in Greece, believing her marriage is strained but salvageable. This night is the definitive betrayal, happening entirely behind her back.\r\n\r\n### **May 22, 1968: The Discovery**\r\n\r\n* **Event:** Cynthia's holiday is cut short. She returns to Kenwood unexpectedly. She finds John and Yoko in the kitchen, sitting cross-legged on the floor, staring at each other. Yoko is wearing Cynthia's white bathrobe. John's only words to her are a casual, \"Oh, hi.\"\r\n* **Cynthia's Awareness:** **Absolute and Devastating.** This is the moment of irrefutable, traumatic discovery. There is no ambiguity. She sees with her own eyes that her marriage is over. In her memoirs, she describes fleeing the house in shock. This event is the emotional climax of her personal story and the undeniable starting point of John and Yoko's public life together.\r\n\r\n## Narrative Significance\r\n\r\nThis timeline provides the \"official story\" of the breakup, the one that Cynthia and the world understood.\r\n\r\n1. **The Slow Burn:** It shows that the affair wasn't a single impulsive act, but a gradual, year-and-a-half-long process. This gives Operation Minuet's psychological campaign ample time to work on John, with his growing paranoia and alienation being easily misinterpreted by Cynthia as symptoms of his obsession with Yoko.\r\n2. **Cynthia's POV:** Her initial dismissal of Yoko makes her eventual discovery more tragic. She is not paranoid or jealous from the start; she is a wife trying to understand her husband's increasingly erratic behavior, making her a highly sympathetic and reliable narrator of events, even if she's an unreliable narrator of their cause.\r\n3. **The Perfect Cover:** The emotional and domestic drama is so powerful and all-consuming that it provides the perfect cover for the underlying political conspiracy. The audience sees the symptoms of MI5's psychological warfare, but Cynthia can only see the affair.

Man. \r\n\r\nRINGO: [approving] Mm. [Paul laughs]\r\n\r\nPAUL: Well, you know, I’m—\r\n\r\nRINGO: Captain. [laughter] \r\n\r\nPAUL: Yeah. [laughs] But you know me about it, I’m just sort of, I don’t know about it, you know. It’s always – with anything, I’m—\r\n\r\nRINGO: It’s great for the film. \r\n\r\nGEORGE: You just keep on until you do know about it.\r\n\r\nPAUL: Exactly, yeah.\r\n\r\n### Beat 3\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### Beat 4\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### Beat 5\r\n\r\nJOHN & PAUL: Wake up in the morning I don’t feel blue / ’Cause I know I got you / Get a funny feeling all day and night / Get the funny feeling you don’t treat me right / Should have read your letter / And then I’d know / Would have felt much better / Because I know you love me so.\r\n\r\n### Beat 6\r\n\r\nPAUL: I never sort of knew what it was about before. I mean, so, she’s on a train—\r\n\r\nJOHN: Yeah.\r\n\r\nPAUL: And he sort of—\r\n\r\nJOHN: And he goes to the station, and misses it.\r\n\r\nPAUL: [laughs] But he goes back and finds that it was the wrong number. So—\r\n\r\nGEORGE: “Wrong location.”\r\n\r\nJOHN: [officious voice] To rhyme with station, you know.\r\n\r\nPAUL: [laughs] That’s great, that. “The rail man said, ‘You’ve got the wrong location.’” “Well…” Great. [pause] Our kid’s been saying, “You should do that,” for years, you know, and we’ve always sort of, “Yeah, well, you know, Mike, you don’t understand about these things…”\r\n\r\n### Beat 7\r\n\r\nPAUL: I’ll wait until tomorrow / Till you come my way / That’s why I sit here / Alone and I pray…\r\n\r\nJOHN & PAUL: But I’ll wait till tomorrow / Through a thousand setting suns / I’ll wait till tomorrow / If tomorrow ever comes…\r\n\r\n### Beat 8\r\n\r\nJOHN & PAUL: Won’t you please say goodbye / This love has long since gone cold / Won’t you please say goodbye / How many times must you be told…\r\n\r\n### Beat 9\r\n\r\nGEORGE: That band – uh, that band Bonnie & Delaney, for Apple, are more together than we’ve ever been. You know, as a band.\r\n\r\nJOHN: Yeah.\r\n\r\nGEORGE: [inaudible] You know, everyone’s who has ever been to see them playing, and sounding, their lives change. It’s really exciting when you hear a real groove on—\r\n\r\nJOHN: You see, I think when we’ve done a month of this and that, and we do an album, that somehow we should either use what we’ve – the togetherness, to do the album. You know.\r\n\r\nGEORGE: Yeah, to do a new one.\r\n\r\nPAUL: Yeah?\r\n\r\nJOHN: Yeah. But you know what I mean. We – we’re – we don’t fit. We’ve sort of run out of touch with it. If we get into the swinging of playing, let’s do an album after this album. You know, about a month later. That is, if we all— [inaudible]\r\n\r\nPAUL: But I mean, you know—\r\n\r\nJOHN: I mean, if we spend two – a month on this—\r\n\r\nPAUL: We are.\r\n\r\nJOHN: —just get to a good peak playing, and then we split.\r\n\r\nPAUL: No, well, we should – we should sort of organise our career, man.\r\n\r\nGEORGE: Yeah.\r\n\r\nPAUL: Get our career together. And this, you know, this is like the idea of this. It’s to get us so we quite enjoy this. Of doing it again. And then what would we like to do next? Well, I would like— [inaudible] —to do a live show, lads?\r\n\r\nGEORGE: Yeah. I think – I think when we learn to, like [inaudible] then we’d dig it. And we know ‘em all, what – you know, if somebody could say “that one” [and we could play them] when we were asked, that’d be great.\r\nPAUL: Well, we can do it, but— [inaudible]\r\n\r\nGEORGE: It’s just that choice. It’s like hard work, really, to do it. And uh, it’s – you know, it’s a drag to try and, you know – ‘cause I want to remember all the words—\r\nPAUL: Right.\r\n\r\nGEORGE: —and really, really get ‘em the way I want it to get ‘em, and to get the guitar, [and not keep being] made to perform when I don’t want to play the guitar. And then you’ve got to play the guitar… when you’re not ready for it. But that… that’s alright.\r\n\r\nPAUL: I don’t know, you know, I mean—\r\n\r\nGEORGE: I mean, we’ve got to do that in order to get the good bit.\r\n\r\nPAUL: Right, yeah.\r\n\r\nGEORGE: We’ve got to get through that bit of shit of the meeting until we get it together again.\r\n\r\nPAUL: [receptive] You know, I can see it just – so we’re just working.\r\n\r\nGEORGE: But – and also there’s so much to get out, you know…\r\n\r\nPAUL: Yeah, right.\r\n\r\nGEORGE: [sincere] And there’s nobody better to get it out with than us. For me, anyway, really. In my heart of hearts.\r\n\r\nPAUL: [long pause; reserved] Yeah.\r\n\r\nGEORGE: It should be where – you know, if you write a song, I feel as though I’ve wrote it. And mine versus – vice versa. You know, I mean – or to be involved, really, as much, as if… That was the good thing about the last album, [because] it’s the only album so far I’ve tried to get involved with.\r\n\r\nPAUL: Yeah.\r\n\r\nGEORGE: [inaudible]\r\n\r\nPAUL: Mm.\r\n\r\nGEORGE: The last one.\r\n\r\n## Notes\r\n\r\nBeat 1: \r\n\r\nBeat 2:\r\n\r\nBeat 3:\r\n\r\nBeat 4:\r\n\r\nBeat 5:\r\n\r\nBeat 6:\r\n\r\nBeat 7:\r\n\r\nBeat 8:\r\n\r\nBeat 9: Amidst a discussion of what the Beatles should play for their projected live show to culminate the (Get Back/Let It Be) sessions  and the general concern of playing live again, John suggests they ride on the momentum that will be built from these sessions/song rehearsals and go directly into making a new album right after (instead of falling into their previous pattern of having long breaks in between recording sessions, which has affected their band chemistry and allowed them to become complacent). Whether John is intentionally implying the breakup of the Beatles as an eventuality or merely using an innocent turn of phrase is unclear, but it prompts both Paul and George to relays their optimism about the band’s future prospects as long as they remain focused.\r\n\r\nGeorge stresses the importance of rehearsing together until they have every number down by heart so that the band can go onstage again without insecurities and utterly assured of themselves and one another. He admits that the pain and tedium of the process has in the past frustrated his resolve in his own compositions and discouraged his level of involvement in the band (i.e. the others’ songs), but acknowledges that it is a necessary course to take and that they would not get anywhere without putting in raw hours of conscientious effort.\r\n\r\nIn this frame of mind, George contends that the Beatles could realign themselves once again as a band more than the sum of their parts if everyone approached every song as if it were their own with the same amount of care and creativity, and in a moment of (perhaps uncharacteristic) sentiment expresses that when the four of them have it together, there’s no one else he’d rather play with.","src/content/research/get-back-dialogue-day-to-day/day-1-get-back.md","ebc745fb5301bcc0",{html:3504,metadata:3505},"<h2 id=\"day-1-overview-january-3-1969\">Day 1 Overview (January 3, 1969)</h2>\n<h3 id=\"beat-1\">Beat 1</h3>\n<h4 id=\"context--proposal\">Context &#x26; Proposal:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>While waiting for John and George to arrive in the studio, Paul noodles on the piano and plays Samuel Barber’s ‘Adagio For Strings’.

He admits that the pain and tedium of the process has in the past frustrated his resolve in his own compositions and discouraged his level of involvement in the band (i.e. the others’ songs), but acknowledges that it is a necessary course to take and that they would not get anywhere without putting in raw hours of conscientious effort.</p>\n<p>In this frame of mind, George contends that the Beatles could realign themselves once again as a band more than the sum of their parts if everyone approached every song as if it were their own with the same amount of care and creativity, and in a moment of (perhaps uncharacteristic) sentiment expresses that when the four of them have it together, there’s no one else he’d rather play with.</p>",{headings:3506,localImagePaths:3572,remoteImagePaths:3573,frontmatter:3574,imagePaths:3577},[3507,3510,3513,3516,3519,3522,3525,3528,3531,3534,3537,3540,3542,3545,3548,3551,3553,3555,3557,3559,3561,3563,3565,3567,3569],{depth:89,slug:3508,text:3509},"day-1-overview-january-3-1969","Day 1 Overview (January 3, 1969)",{depth:64,slug:3511,text:3512},"beat-1","Beat 1",{depth:47,slug:3514,text:3515},"context--proposal","Context & Proposal:",{depth:64,slug:3517,text:3518},"beat-2","Beat 2",{depth:64,slug:3520,text:3521},"beat-3","Beat 3",{depth:64,slug:3523,text:3524},"beat-4","Beat 4",{depth:64,slug:3526,text:3527},"beat-5","Beat 5",{depth:64,slug:3529,text:3530},"beat-6","Beat 6",{depth:64,slug:3532,text:3533},"beat-7","Beat 7",{depth:64,slug:3535,text:3536},"beat-8","Beat 8",{depth:64,slug:3538,text:3539},"beat-9","Beat 9",{depth:47,slug:3541,text:3515},"context--proposal-1",{depth:47,slug:3543,text:3544},"paul--georges-response","Paul & George’s Response:",{depth:47,slug:3546,text:3547},"georges-perspective","George’s Perspective:",{depth:89,slug:3549,text:3550},"actual-dialogue","Actual Dialogue",{depth:64,slug:3552,text:3512},"beat-1-1",{depth:64,slug:3554,text:3518},"beat-2-1",{depth:64,slug:3556,text:3521},"beat-3-1",{depth:64,slug:3558,text:3524},"beat-4-1",{depth:64,slug:3560,text:3527},"beat-5-1",{depth:64,slug:3562,text:3530},"beat-6-1",{depth:64,slug:3564,text:3533},"beat-7-1",{depth:64,slug:3566,text:3536},"beat-8-1",{depth:64,slug:3568,text:3539},"beat-9-1",{depth:89,slug:3570,text:3571},"notes","Notes",[],[],{title:3495,category:1789,date_range:3496,source:1791,reliability:1792,relevance:1793,tags:3575,created:3576},[1431,1795,1796,1797,1798,1799,3498],["Date","2025-12-19T00:00:00.000Z"],[],"get-back-dialogue-day-to-day/day-1-get-back.md","get-back-dialogue-day-to-day/day-11-get-back",{id:3579,data:3581,body:3594,filePath:3595,digest:3596,rendered:3597,legacyId:3632},{title:3582,category:1789,date_range:3583,source:1791,reliability:1792,relevance:1793,tags:3584,created:3593},"Get Back / Let It Be Sessions: Day 11 transcripts and notes","January 23, 1969",[1431,1795,1796,1797,1798,1799,3585,3586,3587,3588,3589,3590,3591,3592],"1/23/1969","JOHN","PAUL","RINGO","GEORGE","MICHAEL","ROBERT","YOKO",["Date","2025-12-19T00:00:00.000Z"],"# 23 January 1969\r\n\r\n## 1\r\n\r\n### Overview\r\n\r\nJanuary 23rd, 1969 (Apple Studios, London): While waiting for Paul and George to arrive in the studio, Michael Lindsay-Hogg asks a piano-toying Ringo if he will have his own song for the upcoming Beatles album.

Paul responds in a possible intimation of his own investment in the band in comparison to John's, and John, in possible acknowledgment of it, contends that he would dig playing onstage as The Beatles again, if not for the inertia they would inevitably labour under as a touring group.\r\n\r\nAs Paul bleakly compares their present monotony in the studio precisely to the monotony they felt while on tour performing the same songs over and over again night after night, George reasons (not unkindly) that it's an emotional cycle that everyone goes through, no matter the state of affairs they're in, and in this case, feels the familiarity of Apple Studios (attendant film crew non-withstanding) would be better for the group's musical finesse than having to involve themselves with the hassle of touring again. Paul, however, remains uncertain of his own feelings and wonders aloud about why he feels them at all. Producer Glyn Johns, who has been listening in, sincerely vouches for the buoyant studio atmosphere and heartening improvement the band has made in the past couple of days, and Yoko, likewise, encourages Paul to ride on the upswing and not tie himself down with the variables.\r\n\r\n### Dialogue\r\n\r\nGEORGE: The things that've worked out best ever for us haven't really been planned any more than this has. It's just, you know, it's like you just go into something and then it does it itself, you know. Whatever it's gonna be, it becomes that, you know.\r\n\r\nJOHN: See, it's turned out – that, for that, but it's not what Paul wants. Like, you know, it was – it's like if – say it's his number, this whole show. Well it's turned – it's a compromise. So now it's actually turned into our number more than his number. That's all.\r\n\r\nPAUL: Yeah, and that's—\r\n\r\nJOHN: And uh—\r\n\r\nPAUL: —and that's alright, you know. It's—\r\n\r\nJOHN: It's alright, but I mean that's what's bugging you, really. Because it's a different number, you know. It's turned into a rock number as opposed to a choir number or something, you know, like that. And uh… [quiet] it's just that, really. [silence]\r\n\r\nPAUL:\r\n\r\nBut it's just funny to sort of realise that after this is all over, you'll be off in a black bag somewhere – on the Albert Hall, you know.\r\n\r\nJOHN: Yes.\r\n\r\nPAUL: And sort of doing shows and stuff, and you know, digging—\r\n\r\nJOHN: Yeah, but I—\r\n\r\nPAUL: —digging that thing of it.\r\n\r\nJOHN: But I don't – I would dig to play on stage, you know.\r\n\r\nPAUL: Yeah.\r\n\r\nJOHN: I mean, if it was – if everything was alright and there was no messing, and we were just going to play onstage… you know.\r\n\r\nPAUL: Yeah. But it's only that. It's only that. I'd like to see Ringo and us – [inaudible] you know, and all that. But I mean—\r\n\r\nJOHN: That's why I said yes to the TV show. I didn't want the – the hell of doing it.\r\n\r\nPAUL: —and I'd like that. I'd like that, see, so that's—\r\n\r\nJOHN: Well, I like playing – 'cause that's why I went on the Stones show [Rock and Roll Circus], you know?\r\n\r\nPAUL: Mm.\r\n\r\nJOHN: [faltering] And that's why I'll – I'll do – things, but I mean if – if we all don't want to do that…\r\n\r\nPAUL: [reserved] Yeah, I know, it is that. It's like the majority decision to – yeah.\r\n\r\nJOHN: [wary] But I don't want to sort of, uh, go on the road again. [silence; guitar playing]\r\n\r\nPAUL: Yeah. I just feel as though we are on the road again. I mean, we are, but we're in the studio. Like, and we just keep to the same environment, totally. Always. We don't ever attempt to break out of that.\r\n\r\nJOHN: Well, we did, though! We did.\r\n\r\nPAUL: And that's – you know. So I mean—\r\n\r\nGEORGE: Yeah. It's just, you break out of one into another and then you want to break out of that.\r\n\r\nPAUL: Yeah, but I mean – you know.\r\n\r\nYOKO: Maybe next week—\r\n\r\nPAUL: [preoccupied] It is like the reason it's nice to live on the country, you know. Just because it's nice out there. It's nice in a warm environment, you know.\r\n\r\nYOKO: [to Paul referring to the other Beatles?] Maybe next week they might change their minds, though.\r\n\r\nJOHN: [to Yoko] [inaudible]\r\n\r\nGEORGE: In my opinion this is the nicest place I've been for a long time, this studio.\r\n\r\nPAUL: Yeah, it is.\r\n\r\nGEORGE: No, really, you know. I mean, and also we've played – this is the most I've ever played, by playing everyday. And I can just, you know, feel myself getting – me fingers getting loose, a bit. Because we don't get a chance for that. But if we go out on the road, then – or whatever – it falls, it gets back into that one. But really I just want to play, and you can play better without having to, you know, do all those things.\r\n\r\nPAUL: [preoccupied] Yeah.\r\n\r\nGEORGE: I mean, it's not so bad now – but it is, really, it would be easier to play without all these mics and without all the cameras and things like that. But uh…\r\n\r\nPAUL: Yeah, it's alright. [silence; George starts playing Bob Dylan's 'All I Really Want To Do']\r\n\r\n…\r\n\r\nPAUL: I don't know what it is, you know, that I'm moaning about, but it's just sort of—\r\n\r\nGLYN: I must admit, I can't really see it like – [laughs; optimistic] because it's – it's just seeing the last two days, everything's gone so ridiculously well.\r\n\r\nPAUL: It is, it's going great, really good.\r\n\r\nYOKO: It's going great.\r\n\r\nGLYN: We still need—\r\n\r\nYOKO: [to Paul; encouraging] And maybe next week it might change, you don't know.\r\n\r\nPAUL: Yeah, sure, I mean…\r\n\r\nYOKO: I mean, it might be great… and everyone might feel like going outside, you know.\r\n\r\nPAUL: Mm.\r\n\r\n### Notes\r\n\r\nA crucial conversation revealing the underlying tensions in the band. John accurately diagnoses that Paul's frustration stems from the project becoming \"our number\" instead of \"his number\"—a compromise Paul struggles with. Paul's cryptic \"you'll be off in a black bag somewhere\" likely references John's increasing separate activities with Yoko. George's measured response shows his growing confidence and articulation of his needs. The exchange reveals how each member is processing the band's direction differently, with Glyn and Yoko trying to inject optimism.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 2\r\n\r\n### Overview\r\n\r\nJanuary 25th, 1969 (Apple Studios, London): Uninterested in discussing the technical vagaries of the Get Back/Let It Be production with Paul and Michael-Lindsay Hogg any longer, John starts to riff on Paul's very first composition, 'I Lost My Little Girl'. Everyone else in the group eventually joins in to jam. (Note: John actually starts singing the song about three minutes prior to the start of this clip, when Paul is still in discussion with Michael Lindsay-Hogg. So, he's been going on for a while.)\r\n\r\n### Dialogue\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### Notes\r\n\r\nJohn's choice to play Paul's first-ever song while Paul is engaged in serious production discussions is both an act of affection and subtle sabotage—a way to deflect from the heavy conversation.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 3\r\n\r\n### Overview\r\n\r\nJanuary 25th, 1969: John and Paul amuse themselves with 'Two Of Us', singing it in German accents, Scottish accents, Jamaican accents, and… whatever else besides.\r\n\r\n### Dialogue\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### Notes\r\n\r\nPlayful vocal experimentation titled \"Eins zwei drei vier! You and I have memories\" in the transcripts. Shows their ability to shift from tension to playfulness.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 4\r\n\r\n### Overview\r\n\r\nJanuary 25th, 1969 (Apple Studios, London): As the band starts to meander after several imperfect and increasingly unserious rehearsals of 'Let It Be' (including a stray comment from Paul that prompts John and George to break into Chuck Berry's 'I'm Talking About You'), Paul tries to steer them back to a serious run-through. John protests in jest and, perhaps reminded of the Beatles' improvised Christmas records, starts thanking the fans for all of the gifts they've sent. The next rehearsal of 'Let It Be' is foiled again by Paul and Ringo, however, enabling John to get into a mock-tirade about not even reaching the part of the song where he comes in (to the amusement of the group).\r\n\r\n### Dialogue\r\n\r\nPAUL: Come on now, come on now, come on now. Come on now – back to the drudgery.\r\n\r\nJOHN: [mock-outrage] It's you that's making it like this, it's you that's bloody making it like—\r\n\r\nPAUL: The real meaning of Christmas. [starts playing 'Let It Be']\r\n\r\nJOHN: I'd especially like to thank you for all the birthday presents…\r\n\r\n…\r\n\r\nPAUL: There will be an answer, let it be… [falters; laughs] Then, is it—\r\n\r\nJOHN: Ah!\r\n\r\nPAUL: Ah.\r\n\r\nJOHN: You shook me. [to Ringo] You stuck in another verse there, Richard.\r\n\r\nPAUL: Yeah. You send me.\r\n\r\nRINGO: What?\r\n\r\nJOHN: He's got another verse in there, now. You come in with the flugle.\r\n\r\nRINGO: Alright, John!\r\n\r\nPAUL: [laughs] You only have to pick your nose and a camera and a boom is over there…\r\n\r\nJOHN: Okay, this is your last chance.\r\n\r\nPAUL: Now look boys, now come on. Enthuse a little.\r\n\r\nJOHN: [mock-outrage] I can't, I don't even get up to my bit, you keep finishing! [everyone laughs] Shut up, will ya, or I'll have you banned from bloody Apple if you don't shut up! [Paul laughs; John subdues himself] Okay, \"Let it be…\" is where I come in… [laughter]\r\n\r\n### Notes\r\n\r\nJohn's mock-outrage at not getting to his part of 'Let It Be' perfectly captures the absurdist humor the Beatles use to defuse tension. Paul's acknowledgment of the ever-present cameras and microphones reveals their self-awareness about being filmed. The \"real meaning of Christmas\" quip references their tradition of making humorous Christmas records for the fan club.","src/content/research/get-back-dialogue-day-to-day/day-13-get-back.md","635a6adc6051fe25",{html:3728,metadata:3729},"<h1 id=\"25-january-1969\">25 January 1969</h1>\n<h2 id=\"1\">1</h2>\n<h3 id=\"overview\">Overview</h3>\n<p>January 25th, 1969 (Apple Studios, London): After a protracted discussion about the prospective production value of (what will eventually be) the Let It Be documentary, George tries to allay Paul’s underlying (overriding) concerns about the still-unstructured production and tells him that the group’s best efforts have tended to be spontaneous anyway, and John points out that Paul’s retainment of his original intentions for this project, in spite of its changes over the past three weeks, is what is causing him anxiety.

It’s just, you break out of one into another and then you want to break out of that.</p>\n<p>PAUL: Yeah, but I mean – you know.</p>\n<p>YOKO: Maybe next week—</p>\n<p>PAUL: [preoccupied] It is like the reason it’s nice to live on the country, you know. Just because it’s nice out there. It’s nice in a warm environment, you know.</p>\n<p>YOKO: [to Paul referring to the other Beatles?] Maybe next week they might change their minds, though.</p>\n<p>JOHN: [to Yoko] [inaudible]</p>\n<p>GEORGE: In my opinion this is the nicest place I’ve been for a long time, this studio.</p>\n<p>PAUL: Yeah, it is.</p>\n<p>GEORGE: No, really, you know. I mean, and also we’ve played – this is the most I’ve ever played, by playing everyday. And I can just, you know, feel myself getting – me fingers getting loose, a bit. Because we don’t get a chance for that. But if we go out on the road, then – or whatever – it falls, it gets back into that one. But really I just want to play, and you can play better without having to, you know, do all those things.</p>\n<p>PAUL: [preoccupied] Yeah.</p>\n<p>GEORGE: I mean, it’s not so bad now – but it is, really, it would be easier to play without all these mics and without all the cameras and things like that. But uh…</p>\n<p>PAUL: Yeah, it’s alright. [silence; George starts playing Bob Dylan’s ‘All I Really Want To Do’]</p>\n<p>…</p>\n<p>PAUL: I don’t know what it is, you know, that I’m moaning about, but it’s just sort of—</p>\n<p>GLYN: I must admit, I can’t really see it like – [laughs; optimistic] because it’s – it’s just seeing the last two days, everything’s gone so ridiculously well.</p>\n<p>PAUL: It is, it’s going great, really good.</p>\n<p>YOKO: It’s going great.</p>\n<p>GLYN: We still need—</p>\n<p>YOKO: [to Paul; encouraging] And maybe next week it might change, you don’t know.</p>\n<p>PAUL: Yeah, sure, I mean…</p>\n<p>YOKO: I mean, it might be great… and everyone might feel like going outside, you know.</p>\n<p>PAUL: Mm.</p>\n<h3 id=\"notes\">Notes</h3>\n<p>A crucial conversation revealing the underlying tensions in the band. John accurately diagnoses that Paul’s frustration stems from the project becoming “our number” instead of “his number”—a compromise Paul struggles with. Paul’s cryptic “you’ll be off in a black bag somewhere” likely references John’s increasing separate activities with Yoko. George’s measured response shows his growing confidence and articulation of his needs. The exchange reveals how each member is processing the band’s direction differently, with Glyn and Yoko trying to inject optimism.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"2\">2</h2>\n<h3 id=\"overview-1\">Overview</h3>\n<p>January 25th, 1969 (Apple Studios, London): Uninterested in discussing the technical vagaries of the Get Back/Let It Be production with Paul and Michael-Lindsay Hogg any longer, John starts to riff on Paul’s very first composition, ‘I Lost My Little Girl’. Everyone else in the group eventually joins in to jam. (Note: John actually starts singing the song about three minutes prior to the start of this clip, when Paul is still in discussion with Michael Lindsay-Hogg. So, he’s been going on for a while.)</p>\n<h3 id=\"dialogue-1\">Dialogue</h3>\n<p>N/A</p>\n<h3 id=\"notes-1\">Notes</h3>\n<p>John’s choice to play Paul’s first-ever song while Paul is engaged in serious production discussions is both an act of affection and subtle sabotage—a way to deflect from the heavy conversation.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"3\">3</h2>\n<h3 id=\"overview-2\">Overview</h3>\n<p>January 25th, 1969: John and Paul amuse themselves with ‘Two Of Us’, singing it in German accents, Scottish accents, Jamaican accents, and… whatever else besides.</p>\n<h3 id=\"dialogue-2\">Dialogue</h3>\n<p>N/A</p>\n<h3 id=\"notes-2\">Notes</h3>\n<p>Playful vocal experimentation titled “Eins zwei drei vier! You and I have memories” in the transcripts. Shows their ability to shift from tension to playfulness.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"4\">4</h2>\n<h3 id=\"overview-3\">Overview</h3>\n<p>January 25th, 1969 (Apple Studios, London): As the band starts to meander after several imperfect and increasingly unserious rehearsals of ‘Let It Be’ (including a stray comment from Paul that prompts John and George to break into Chuck Berry’s ‘I’m Talking About You’), Paul tries to steer them back to a serious run-through. John protests in jest and, perhaps reminded of the Beatles’ improvised Christmas records, starts thanking the fans for all of the gifts they’ve sent. The next rehearsal of ‘Let It Be’ is foiled again by Paul and Ringo, however, enabling John to get into a mock-tirade about not even reaching the part of the song where he comes in (to the amusement of the group).</p>\n<h3 id=\"dialogue-3\">Dialogue</h3>\n<p>PAUL: Come on now, come on now, come on now. Come on now – back to the drudgery.</p>\n<p>JOHN: [mock-outrage] It’s you that’s making it like this, it’s you that’s bloody making it like—</p>\n<p>PAUL: The real meaning of Christmas. [starts playing ‘Let It Be’]</p>\n<p>JOHN: I’d especially like to thank you for all the birthday presents…</p>\n<p>…</p>\n<p>PAUL: There will be an answer, let it be… [falters; laughs] Then, is it—</p>\n<p>JOHN: Ah!</p>\n<p>PAUL: Ah.</p>\n<p>JOHN: You shook me. [to Ringo] You stuck in another verse there, Richard.</p>\n<p>PAUL: Yeah. You send me.</p>\n<p>RINGO: What?</p>\n<p>JOHN: He’s got another verse in there, now. You come in with the flugle.</p>\n<p>RINGO: Alright, John!</p>\n<p>PAUL: [laughs] You only have to pick your nose and a camera and a boom is over there…</p>\n<p>JOHN: Okay, this is your last chance.</p>\n<p>PAUL: Now look boys, now come on. Enthuse a little.</p>\n<p>JOHN: [mock-outrage] I can’t, I don’t even get up to my bit, you keep finishing! [everyone laughs] Shut up, will ya, or I’ll have you banned from bloody Apple if you don’t shut up! [Paul laughs; John subdues himself] Okay, “Let it be…” is where I come in… [laughter]</p>\n<h3 id=\"notes-3\">Notes</h3>\n<p>John’s mock-outrage at not getting to his part of ‘Let It Be’ perfectly captures the absurdist humor the Beatles use to defuse tension. Paul’s acknowledgment of the ever-present cameras and microphones reveals their self-awareness about being filmed. The “real meaning of Christmas” quip references their tradition of making humorous Christmas records for the fan club.</p>",{headings:3730,localImagePaths:3750,remoteImagePaths:3751,frontmatter:3752,imagePaths:3755},[3731,3734,3735,3736,3737,3738,3739,3740,3741,3742,3743,3744,3745,3746,3747,3748,3749],{depth:15,slug:3732,text:3733},"25-january-1969","25 January 1969",{depth:89,slug:3605,text:3605},{depth:64,slug:1581,text:1582},{depth:64,slug:1799,text:3608},{depth:64,slug:3570,text:3571},{depth:89,slug:3611,text:3611},{depth:64,slug:3613,text:1582},{depth:64,slug:3615,text:3608},{depth:64,slug:3617,text:3571},{depth:89,slug:3619,text:3619},{depth:64,slug:3621,text:1582},{depth:64,slug:3623,text:3608},{depth:64,slug:3625,text:3571},{depth:89,slug:3664,text:3664},{depth:64,slug:3666,text:1582},{depth:64,slug:3668,text:3608},{depth:64,slug:3670,text:3571},[],[],{title:3718,category:1789,date_range:3719,source:1791,reliability:1792,relevance:1793,tags:3753,created:3754},[1431,1795,1796,1797,1798,1799,3721,3586,3587,3589,3588,3592,3722],["Date","2025-12-19T00:00:00.000Z"],[],"get-back-dialogue-day-to-day/day-13-get-back.md","get-back-dialogue-day-to-day/day-14-get-back",{id:3757,data:3759,body:3767,filePath:3768,digest:3769,rendered:3770,legacyId:3803},{title:3760,category:1789,date_range:3761,source:1791,reliability:1792,relevance:1793,tags:3762,created:3766},"Get Back / Let It Be Sessions: Day 14 transcripts and notes","January 26, 1969",[1431,1795,1796,1797,1798,1799,3763,3586,3587,3589,3588,3764,3765],"1/26/1969","HEATHER","LINDA",["Date","2025-12-19T00:00:00.000Z"],"# 26 January 1969\r\n\r\n## 1\r\n\r\n### Overview\r\n\r\nJanuary 26th, 1969: Paul arrives at the studio accompanied by Linda and Heather just as George and Ringo are working out the melody for 'Octopus's Garden' on the piano. John, who has been playing around on drums, chimes in none too discreetly with a question he's been eager to ask Paul.\r\n\r\n### Dialogue\r\n\r\nJOHN: Hey! Did you dream about me last night?\r\n\r\nPAUL: [long pause] I can't remember.\r\n\r\nJOHN: Very strong dream. We both dreamt about it. It was amazing! Different dreams, you know, but I thought you must've been there. [inaudible] I was touching you. [inaudible]\r\n\r\nPAUL: Nothing to worry about, though?\r\n\r\nJOHN: Nothing to worry about, no.\r\n\r\n### Notes\r\n\r\nOne of the most intimate and revealing exchanges in the sessions. John's eagerness to share his dream about Paul—in which he was \"touching\" him—and his assumption that Paul must have had the same dream shows the depth of their psychic connection. Paul's cautious response (\"Nothing to worry about, though?\") suggests both curiosity and unease. John's reassurance is gentle.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 2\r\n\r\n### Overview\r\n\r\nJanuary 26th, 1969 (Apple Studios, London): As the Beatles work on the arrangement for Octopus's Garden', Ringo tells Paul about the basis for the song, piquing George's memory of what he was once told about octopuses. (Note: John's on drums. This clip from the sessions is shortly followed by Heather sharing her personal octopus anecdote with John—which I can't make out, unfortunately—and more animal banter.)\r\n\r\n### Dialogue\r\n\r\nGEORGE: Hey, it was somebody – he was telling me octopuses go and pick up all the seashells. You know about that?\r\n\r\nRINGO: Yes, that's why I wrote it! 'Cause the guides told me [about them] on the boat in Sardinia. [inaudible]\r\n\r\nGEORGE: Yeah. [to Paul] You know about that? They collect all nice-looking things and make a garden around where they are and just with all their groovy things to sleep behind.\r\n\r\nRINGO: Yeah.\r\n\r\nGEORGE: [laughs] It's great.\r\n\r\n### Notes\r\n\r\nThe origin story of 'Octopus's Garden'—Ringo learned about octopuses' nest-building behavior from boat guides in Sardinia. George's enthusiasm for the natural world comes through clearly. The song represents Ringo's desire for a peaceful underwater escape, a telling metaphor during these tense sessions.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 3\r\n\r\n### Overview\r\n\r\nJanuary 26th, 1969 (Apple Studio): While Paul, George, and Ringo work on the arrangement for 'Octopus's Garden', John teases Paul and Linda's daughter Heather about her new pets.\r\n\r\n### Dialogue\r\n\r\nHEATHER: We've got some baby kittens only about that big—\r\n\r\nJOHN: Are you going to eat them?\r\n\r\nHEATHER: No!\r\n\r\nJOHN: Lots of people do, you know.

On toast?\r\n\r\nJOHN: You put pastry around them, and then you have cat pie.\r\n\r\nHEATHER: A few days they were just born, weren't they?\r\n\r\nJOHN: Oh, you'd better wait a week or two before you eat them.\r\n\r\nHEATHER: No, I'm never going to eat them!\r\n\r\nJOHN: Aren't you? Well, that's very good.\r\n\r\nHEATHER: And then we took the grown-ups, and one of them's beautiful, like this Daddy cat.

[laughter]\r\n\r\nHEATHER: You don't eat any cats! They don't taste good.

'Much more than I love the Queen.'\" [laughter; Paul hums]\r\n\r\nJOHN:\r\n\r\nThe layout of the book's really good though, the way he's done it.\r\n\r\nPAUL: This – is this the layout?\r\n\r\nJOHN: No, this is just the bit – that bit, you know. Because he's gonna have that folding out of the book, sheets, like, because – to get them all together. But it's just, you know. The packaging is great.\r\n\r\nPAUL: It's good, yeah. Great. [inaudible; continues reading articles aloud]\r\n\r\n?: What else is there?\r\n\r\nJOHN: There's hundreds of things, you know, this is just the press part of it. There's all the letters I got, and the photos of the exhibition, and – yeah.\r\n\r\n?: Oh, just this topic.\r\n\r\nJOHN: Yeah. The whole You Are Here book, you know. Book of the film of the video.\r\n\r\n?: And the policeman. Is that included in the film? The statement—\r\n\r\nJOHN: No, no. This is just – just that one day. Reaction to one day.\r\n\r\nYOKO: It's amazing, isn't it? Just for that one day.\r\n\r\nPAUL: Yes.\r\n\r\nJOHN: But it's just great you know, it's sort of like what we're doing now. We're doing a show, and then you bring in a book of the show—\r\n\r\nPAUL: Yeah.\r\n\r\n?: Who's doing it?\r\n\r\nJOHN: Uh, publishing it?\r\n\r\n?: Yeah.\r\n\r\nJOHN: Cape. That's what I think—\r\n\r\nYOKO: That's what – I think that's where we're going with, Cape.\r\n\r\nJOHN: Yeah, I'm gonna go to Cape.\r\n\r\nPAUL: Is there a next book that you'll be expecting?\r\n\r\nJOHN: Yeah, but I owe it [inaudible] in the contract.\r\n\r\nPAUL: Oh, indeed. Great.\r\n\r\nJOHN: So they'll have to pay for it, and it's expensive. The other one's cost nothing to do.\r\n\r\n?: Who does this for you?\r\n\r\nYOKO: Oh, the [inaudible] or something.\r\n\r\n?: Oh, you have a [clipping] service, do you? Yeah, great.\r\n\r\n### Notes\r\n\r\nPaul's willingness to engage with John's art projects shows his support despite the underlying tensions. The press clippings about John and Yoko's relationship and the \"actress Yoko Ono\" designation provide humor. John's comparison of his art book to their current documentary project (\"We're doing a show, and then you bring in a book of the show\") shows he's thinking across multiple media formats.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 2\r\n\r\n### Overview\r\n\r\nJanuary 27th, 1969 (Apple Studios, London): As producer Glyn Johns grouses about having been apprehended by the police on a petty driving charge (and causing him to be late to arrive in the studio), Paul commiserates and humorously shares his own peeved exchanges with policemen on the road.\r\n\r\n### Dialogue\r\n\r\nPAUL: Let me take you down, 'cause I'm going to…\r\n\r\nGLYN: Can you believe that bleeding copper! [stuffy voice] \"Oh, alright, I'll have to report this, you know, anything you say will be taken down,\" and it went through all that!\r\n\r\nJOHN: Have you got a fag?\r\n\r\nGLYN: Yeah.\r\n\r\nPAUL: I had a terrible scene the other day on the motorway with a copper. 'Cause they stopped me, and I – I don't like it, getting stopped by police. I always get – I get obnoxious with them, you know. [Yoko laughs] 'Cause I'll just sort of check around to see if I'm in the right, and once I know I am, and they've stopped me, I get very… But they just stopped me because I was hogging the outside lane, and you're not supposed to do that. So he said, \"You did, you know.\" You're going seventy. You've got to stay out there, but you're not supposed to get back in. So he stopped me, and then it really got sort of nasty after a bit. 'Cause Linda just had her hand round the back of my head, and then he said, \"You can't possibly be in – in control!\"\r\n\r\nYOKO: [laughs] Oh, no.\r\n\r\nPAUL: \"You see how that young lady was fondling the back of your neck…\" [uproarious laughter] And I said, \"Oh, what's up with you, then? Don't you get it?\" [laughter] You know, and it got really like that. \"Oh! You can't book me for that, Constable!\" You know, it got really sort of… \"Oh, can't I!\" [laughter] And of course, my tax. [laughs] They got me. My tax wasn't up to date and all.\r\n\r\nJOHN:\r\n\r\nDon't they just do it at the office for us?\r\n\r\nPAUL: No.\r\n\r\nJOHN: Oh. I probably haven't had one done since I started, then. [laughter]\r\n\r\nPAUL: They keep doing that. I was going through Mersey Tunnel, and they keep stopping me in the Mersey Tunnel 'cause they see you and they just want an autograph. So I sort of thought, \"Right, this time, they're not going to stop me.\" And a fella comes up, and I just – all the way through the tunnel, I did thirty. Just saw him in the mirror all the time. I thought, \"You… you're going to stop me at the end and ask me for an autograph.\"\r\n\r\nSo he just sort of drives in front of me waves me down, so I'm just — ah! [laughter] – crash in with him and say, \"No, no, I have no time, no time!\" And he just… [grumbling] So he stopped me and said, \"… Your tax.\" [laughter] Yeah. I can't stand that, I really go sort of funny with police. You know, police [inaudible] when nothing's been done, fighting against them before they've got me for anything. I don't like it.\r\n\r\n### Notes\r\n\r\nPaul's detailed story about being stopped by police reveals his confrontational streak and his resentment of authority. The policeman's accusation that Linda \"fondling\" Paul's neck means he can't be in control of the vehicle leads to Paul's cheeky response. John's admission that he probably hasn't had his car tax done \"since I started\" is classic Lennon obliviousness to practical matters.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 3\r\n\r\n### Overview\r\n\r\nJanuary 27th, 1969 (Apple Studios, London): A chipper George is the last to arrive at the studio while the rest of the group is having breakfast. He tells the group that he was up the previous night writing a song (prompting John to reveal that he's been having trouble sleeping himself), in mind of John's old advice to finish a song within the time you start writing it. This, in full awareness of John's own less-than-disciplined creative process, incites knowing laughter from the group. (Note: The song George wrote was 'Old Brown Shoe'.)\r\n\r\n### Dialogue\r\n\r\nJOHN: I have a complaint as a director of Apple – no bog paper.\r\n\r\nPAUL: Oh yeah? [Yoko laughs]\r\n\r\nJOHN: Terrible disgrace.\r\n\r\nPAUL: They've got [it in] pink upstairs.\r\n\r\nJOHN: Have they?\r\n\r\nPAUL: Yeah. [George arrives]\r\n\r\nJOHN: Hi.\r\n\r\nPAUL: Hi, George.\r\n\r\nGEORGE: Hello, how are you? Happy new year!\r\n\r\nJOHN: [joking] George's just come from a party too.\r\n\r\nGEORGE: [laughs] Yeah, I thought…\r\n\r\nJOHN: Two hours extra sleep [inaudible].\r\n\r\nGEORGE: Oh, I didn't, I went to bed very late. I wrote a new song, actually.\r\n\r\nJOHN: I couldn't sleep.\r\n\r\nGEORGE: I wrote a great song actually.\r\n\r\nJOHN: About what? [taps out a familiar rhythm in question]\r\n\r\nGEORGE: No, though – oh that, no, I just played with that bit. Just – a different one, altogether. Very exciting. [laughs]\r\n\r\nJOHN: It's such a high when you get home.\r\n\r\nYOKO: Mm.\r\n\r\nGEORGE: Happy. Happy, and a rocker…\r\n\r\nPAUL: Yeah?\r\n\r\nGEORGE: Happy and a rocker! [laughs] Too much.\r\n\r\n…\r\n\r\nJOHN: Well, it's just so high when you get in at night.\r\n\r\nGEORGE: Yeah, it's great, isn't it? [laughs]\r\n\r\nJOHN: I just – you know, that bit like on acid, where you see a little hand miles away.\r\n\r\nPAUL: Mm.\r\n\r\nJOHN: I was just sitting there listening to the last bit. [stage whisper] \"Help! What if I have? What if I haven't, today?\" [laughter] You know, \"[inaudible] Do they have anything?\"\r\n\r\nYOKO: You should just try in general.\r\n\r\nJOHN: I just can't sleep! I just— [starts making garbled noises and sounds] You know. \"I'm a feeling a little thing here…\" [makes the sound of a trumpet blaring; laughs]\r\n\r\nGEORGE: Uh, I keep thinking, \"Oh, I'll just go to bed now,\" and then I keep hearing your voice from about ten years ago saying, \"Finish 'em straightaway. As soon as you start 'em, you've got finish it too.\" [pause] You once told me it was best to finish a song, so I was just there to… [uproarious laughter]\r\n\r\nJOHN: [laughs] But I never do it, you know. I can't do it. But I know it's the best.\r\n\r\nPAUL: Yeah.\r\n\r\n### Notes\r\n\r\nGeorge arrives energized after writing 'Old Brown Shoe' overnight, following John's decade-old advice to finish songs immediately—advice John admits he never follows himself. The group's laughter at this hypocrisy is warm. John's description of his insomnia and acid-like sensations suggests he's struggling with something (possibly withdrawal or drug effects). George's creative burst and happiness is a positive sign for the sessions.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 4\r\n\r\n### Overview\r\n\r\nJanuary 27th, 1969 (Apple Studios, London): The Beatles play an extended run-through of 'Oh! Darling', with John offering harmony and call-and-response to Paul's lead vocal. (Note: A considerably shorter and edited version of this take was included on Anthology 3.)\r\n\r\n### Dialogue\r\n\r\nPAUL: When you told me…\r\n\r\nJOHN: When you told me…\r\n\r\nPAUL: You didn't need me…\r\n\r\nJOHN: You'd never leave me…\r\n\r\nPAUL: Anymore / You know I nearly broke down and died / Oh when you told me / You didn't need me anymore / You know I nearly broke down and died…\r\n\r\n### Notes\r\n\r\nThe interplay between John and Paul's vocals on 'Oh! Darling' is poignant given the band's circumstances. John's harmony line \"You'd never leave me\" against Paul's \"You didn't need me\" creates a dialogue of abandonment and reassurance.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 5\r\n\r\n### Overview\r\n\r\nJanuary 27th, 1969 (Apple Studios, London): John and Paul sing an ephemeral mashup of Sam Cooke's 'Bring It On Home To Me' and 'Oh! Darling' before segueing into 'Oh! Darling' proper.\r\n\r\n### Dialogue\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### Notes\r\n\r\nBrief musical moment blending Sam Cooke's soul classic with their own song.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 6\r\n\r\n### Overview\r\n\r\nJanuary 27th, 1969: Paul sings an amusing mock-German version of 'Get Back' (along with liberal doses of mock-French).\r\n\r\n### Dialogue\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### Notes\r\n\r\nMore playful vocal experimentation, showing the band's ability to find levity.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 7\r\n\r\n### Overview\r\n\r\nJanuary 27th, 1969: John and Paul play a bluesy mash-up during the Let It Be sessions, with John taking lead vocal for 'Get Back', and Paul singing an unidentified song (possibly made up on the spot) full of holy, apocalyptic fervor.\r\n\r\n### Dialogue\r\n\r\nPAUL: Order! Order! We've got to call order, John, I mean, you know, we're wasting valuable time here, son.\r\n\r\nJOHN: Don't let me down, babe!\r\n\r\n### Notes\r\n\r\nPaul's attempt to rein in the jam session with \"we're wasting valuable time\" contrasts with John's musical response—a plea from 'Don't Let Me Down'. The exchange encapsulates their dynamic: Paul as taskmaster, John as resistant artist.","src/content/research/get-back-dialogue-day-to-day/day-15-get-back.md","fd9f207637fad515",{html:3816,metadata:3817},"<h1 id=\"27-january-1969\">27 January 1969</h1>\n<h2 id=\"1\">1</h2>\n<h3 id=\"overview\">Overview</h3>\n<p>January 27th, 1969 (Apple Studios, London): Over breakfast, John shows Paul a book he’s had compiled of the various press articles covering John and Yoko’s You Are Here art show.

At a loss for articulating in concrete terms what may be obstructing the group from performing as well as they could, Paul wonders if they can only be cured of their repression and/or indecision if they are thrust unexpectedly into a foreign situation and forced by circumstance to adapt and improve unquestioningly, as they experienced in the early days of the band.\r\n\r\n(Note: An edited segment of this discussion was later included in the official Let It Be documentary. Overall, the reality of John and Paul's exchange is less one-sided than it may seem in the film; this excerpt in itself is but a portion of it, and it shortly after expands to include George as well when he arrives at the studio.)\r\n\r\n### Dialogue\r\n\r\nJOHN: I can't wait to work, here, you know.\r\n\r\nPAUL: Yeah.\r\n\r\nJOHN: Either… Anyway, you know. I just can't wait to just—\r\n\r\nPAUL: Do it.\r\n\r\nJOHN: —have it, you know.\r\n\r\nPAUL: Yeah, but so… Hmm. But I'm just talking about this thing, like this thing we've entered upon now, we still haven't got any aim for it, except another album, again. Our only aim, ever, is an album. Which is like a very non-visual thing, it's very sort of… But it's great, isn't it, and we do albums, then. But—\r\n\r\nJOHN: But albums is what we're doing, at the moment.\r\n\r\nPAUL: [uneasy] Yeah, but I don't know. Like—\r\n\r\nJOHN: I mean, that's what we [inaudible] talk about.\r\n\r\nPAUL: —like I was saying the other day, is that you – is that you – you— [hesitating] We're into albums as the four of us, but I really think we could be into other things. But every time I talk about it, I really sound like I'm the showbiz correspondent, trying to hustle us to do a Judy Garland comeback, you know. But really, all I mean is – well, look, let's get – let's change, or let's go into a studio, like a vision studio, after we've learnt all of these, that's just as good as this for sound, that's got the same sort of thinking…\r\n\r\nJOHN: I think it's daft to move from this one, you know, I mean—\r\n\r\nPAUL: But it's like we got much better takes after we moved from Twickenham to here.\r\n\r\nJOHN: Oh, yeah, but I mean here, in our life it's like home, you know.\r\n\r\nPAUL: Yeah, sure, but our takes are getting not as good. So I'm just trying to think of a remedy.\r\n\r\nJOHN: Yes, but it's up to Glyn to take it.\r\n\r\nPAUL: Which he has been doing all yesterday, now, and 'Get Back', like you said, you know, we're not in it.\r\n\r\nJOHN: Yeah, but that depends on the day.\r\n\r\nPAUL: But the thing that puts us in it are the things – the only ever thing that has put us in it is a novelty. We're, you know—\r\n\r\nJOHN: Yes, yes.\r\n\r\nPAUL: We're ve– we work on novelty. If there's a new approach, if he says, \"Take\", we take for the first time.\r\n\r\nJOHN: Mm.\r\n\r\nPAUL: Oh, you know, I mean, we're gonna be great in the rough dubs, these, because we don't care, you know, and it's great. And now it's gonna be very hard to better those – that dub we've got. There's just so much in it, even 'Teddy Boy', not having words. It's just, there's so much in all of that.\r\n\r\nJOHN: Yeah. Yeah, I have to agree—\r\n\r\nPAUL: And it's like, it's gonna be hard to better it.\r\n\r\nJOHN: —but I don't think another move is gonna be the answer. It's just like every—[inaudible]\r\n\r\nPAUL: You see, I said to Michael that he should really just—just black this, just make this black one day, so that when we come in in the morning, it's – \"What is it?\" I mean, you know. You've got to be sneaky with the Beatles, or else we'll just go on forever in a circle. We really won't get out of it. 'Cause whenever we talk about it, we have certain rules – like George was saying. \"What do you want to do?\" And he says, \"No films.\" But it's wrong, that. It's very wrong, though, because you don't know. He says – what he means is, \"No Help! or Hard Day's,\" and I agree, you know. But like, films – 'cause this is a film – and he now doesn't mind this.\r\n\r\nJOHN: Yeah.\r\n\r\nPAUL: But it's like – it's that kind of thing, like no TV shows, no audience. But, I mean – see, it's like when we came back from Hamburg and did Leicester Du Montfort Hall, or wherever it was, Coventry – we played the ballroom, and we had the worst first night then, and we were all nervous, and it was terrible. Then we played another the next night, and we got a little bit better; the next night, hmm; and then the next! [vocalising] It was just too much, and we got into the playing because we got over the hang-up of the audience, and it was just like there was no one there, but it was a ner– a new sort of thing, and there was some fella in the front watching how you were playing… you know? And you just – we were just right into it. And those would have been – if we could have recorded those things, they will have been the greatest, because it is. It's like Mal was saying, he said, \"It's the bounce thing,\" you know. And we're good at that, you know, once we get over the nervousness. But it's like, it's the hurdle of that nervousness is there, now. So that… you know. [hesitating] We're – we can't get over it now, unless – well, unless we really sort of, like, go to the Albert Hall and get in a black bag, you know.\r\n\r\nJOHN: Mm.\r\n\r\nPAUL: There's no other way. We can't think ourselves out of it. And we can't sort of say, well, it will be alright. See, and then the only other alternative to that is to say, well, we don't – we will never do it to an audience again. But if we intend to – to keep any sort of contact on that scene… [pause] Yeah. I do understand George's just saying, \"There's no point,\" you know, because it is like we're Stravinsky, and it's in the music. And he doesn't sort of get up and play his 'Joanna' for them anymore. He just writes it, and just sort of maybe occasionally conducts it.\r\n\r\nJOHN: But as long as there's a good reason – like George wants to do a heavy show, like Dylan and Presley, all that.\r\n\r\nPAUL: Mm.\r\n\r\nJOHN: And that'll be a large – I don't know, like, I mean, that – that's all this.\r\n\r\nPAUL: Mm, yeah, I know, yeah. that's always – that's always just—\r\n\r\nJOHN: Okay, yeah.\r\n\r\nPAUL: That's us again, you know.\r\n\r\nJOHN: Yes, I know.\r\n\r\nPAUL: It's us going silly again.\r\n\r\nJOHN: It is, and I think – I think we might do it.\r\n\r\nPAUL: Yeah, sure, but I mean the thing is they could do that one after you've done your own one, you know.\r\n\r\nJOHN: Yes, yeah. But I think that—\r\n\r\nPAUL: It's like, it's like this thing, man. There is a show to be had out of what we've got here, which is just so incredible. It's unbelievable. And you don't have to go on the roof, you don't have to go anywhere. You really only have to sing 'em. And combined with the documentary material leading up to it, it's just like an unbelievable thing. Because you'll have the two elements and you've got it there, and there's no – we don't need any need to move from here. But somehow we need to get us for the – see, it's like we've got all the lead-up, and the only thing we haven't got for every song is the – the song, yet.\r\n\r\n### Notes\r\n\r\nThis extensive conversation is one of the most revealing about the Beatles' creative process and their internal struggles. Paul articulates his frustration that the band only works when faced with novelty or external pressure, and can't motivate themselves through pure intention. His insight that \"you've got to be sneaky with the Beatles\" acknowledges their resistance to being managed or directed. John's position that Apple Studios is \"like home\" reveals his desire for comfort over challenge. Paul's Hamburg analogy—where repeated performances dissolved their nervousness—shows he understands they need the pressure of an audience to transcend their current malaise. The exchange is circular, exhausting, and ultimately unresolved, foreshadowing the band's inability to find a sustainable working method.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 2\r\n\r\n### Overview\r\n\r\nJanuary 29th, 1969: John and Paul work carefully on their vocal harmony for the refrain of 'Dig A Pony'. John, whose voice is tired and strained, is self-deprecating about his own efforts. Paul, perhaps attuned to it, is quick to profess his admiration for the song.\r\n\r\n### Dialogue\r\n\r\nJOHN & PAUL: All I want is you…\r\n\r\nJOHN: But see, now we get into adding a little bit more paint, you know.\r\n\r\nPAUL: It's alright, yeah. No, that's good, that one.\r\n\r\nJOHN: Okay, tick it.\r\n\r\nPAUL: [sincere] I love that one.\r\n\r\nJOHN: [reticent] Thank you.\r\n\r\nPAUL: [insistent] I really really do.\r\n\r\nJOHN: Thank you. [quiet] I enjoy it too. Sometimes. [pause] So that's done.\r\n\r\nPAUL: Um—\r\n\r\nJOHN: Next, please\r\n\r\n### Notes\r\n\r\nA tender moment. Paul's insistent praise for 'Dig A Pony' meets John's self-deprecating reticence. John's admission that he enjoys his own song \"sometimes\" reveals his insecurity and perhaps his altered emotional state (possibly due to heroin use). Paul's repeated reassurance shows care and support, but John deflects with \"Next, please,\" unable to accept the compliment fully.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 3\r\n\r\n### Overview\r\n\r\nJanuary 29th, 1969 (Apple Studios, London): With some reservation (and/or hesitation), George expresses his desire to record and release an album of solo material after the sessions for Get Back/Let It Be are concluded, in mind of all the songs he's written and accumulated over the years. John and Yoko support the idea, but George (perhaps sensing that John's perception of \"going solo\" and what it symbolises is more absolute than his own) elaborates that he thinks it'd be a good thing not just for each member of the band, but for the Beatles as a band proper—they would be able to both free themselves creatively in their own personal outlets as well as play and record as a group without feeling stifled, innately in tune with one another.\r\n\r\n(In other words, the band doesn't have to sever all ties to go their own way. Ultimately, it's difficult to determine if George is merely expressing, in a carefully unassuming way, his own intentions for individuation in light of John's recent solo output with Yoko and growing estrangement from the Beatles family, or if he is making a discrete appeal to John of making up instead of breaking up, and is still, despite all of the Beatles' overlapping troubles over the past two years, not least the past two weeks, genuinely attuned to the idea of the band staying together.)\r\n\r\n### Dialogue\r\n\r\nGEORGE: John.\r\n\r\nJOHN: Yeah?\r\n\r\nGEORGE: I tell you what I'd like to do. After this—\r\n\r\nPAUL: After this TV—?\r\n\r\nGEORGE: —after this show. Um, you know, I've got so many songs that I've got, like, my quota of tunes for the next ten – you know, years, or albums.\r\n\r\nJOHN: Yeah.\r\n\r\nGEORGE: And I'd just like to maybe do an album, of songs.\r\n\r\nJOHN: Of – on your own?\r\n\r\nGEORGE: Yeah.\r\n\r\nJOHN: Yeah.\r\n\r\nGEORGE: But I mean, I'd like it so that if… uh… [long pause] 'Cause it would be nice, it would be nice to mainly get them all out of the way—\r\n\r\nJOHN: Yeah. It'd be nice anyway.\r\n\r\nGEORGE: And secondly, just to hear what I – what all mine are like all together.\r\n\r\nJOHN: Yeah, as long – you see, it's good. If we put [out] an LP and it's all safe that will be 'cause it's together, but George is doing an album and—\r\n\r\nGEORGE: Oh yeah, but I mean it'd be nice to, uh—\r\n\r\nJOHN: It'd be the same as me doing an album.\r\n\r\nGEORGE: —if any of us can do the separate things, like, as well.\r\n\r\nJOHN:\r\n\r\nWell, I mean—\r\n\r\nGEORGE: That way, it also preserves this, the Beatle bit of it, more. 'Cause then—\r\n\r\nJOHN: This – there's an outlet for every note you want.\r\n\r\nGEORGE: You know, 'cause all these songs of mine, I can give them to people who could do them good, but I suddenly realised – fuck all that. I'm just gonna do me for a bit. [laughs] You know?\r\n\r\nYOKO: That's great. That's a good idea.\r\n\r\nJOHN: Yeah.\r\n\r\nGEORGE: And uh, you know. [pause] With all these tunes I could do 'em like – I could them in a week, at the most. I could have it all, just record 'em all, remixed and everything, 'cause they're all very simple, you know. I mean, I don't think they need much. I mean with a Leslie it's too much, just one guitar.

His careful framing—that solo albums would \"preserve\" the Beatles rather than threaten them—shows he's trying to find a middle path. His realization \"fuck all that, I'm just gonna do me for a bit\" is a declaration of independence. John's support is genuine but also reflects his own desire for creative autonomy. George's backlog of songs (which would become his acclaimed triple album \"All Things Must Pass\") shows how constrained he's felt within the Beatles' structure. This conversation plants the seed for the band's eventual dissolution, even as George frames it as a way to keep the band together.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 4\r\n\r\n### Overview\r\n\r\nJanuary 29th, 1969 (Apple Studios, London): The Beatles perform a boozy rendition of The Coasters' 'Three Cool Cats'.\r\n\r\n### Dialogue\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### Notes\r\n\r\nBrief musical interlude covering a 1950s rock and roll classic.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 5\r\n\r\n### Overview\r\n\r\nJanuary 29th, 1969: John and Paul amuse themselves with 'Two Of Us', singing it with grit teeth.\r\n\r\n### Dialogue\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### Notes\r\n\r\nMore playful experimentation with vocal techniques on 'Two Of Us', showing their continued ability to find humor together.","src/content/research/get-back-dialogue-day-to-day/day-17-get-back.md","32b7e48db573bb36",{html:3915,metadata:3916},"<h1 id=\"29-january-1969\">29 January 1969</h1>\n<h2 id=\"1\">1</h2>\n<h3 id=\"overview\">Overview</h3>\n<p>January 29th, 1969 (Apple Studios, London): A scattered morning discussion with Michael Lindsay-Hogg, Glyn Johns, and George Martin on the advent of having the group perform on the Apple Studios rooftop leads Paul into a circular conversation with John about the multiple media ventures they’re trying to pursue with this one recording session, and the persisting concern that the Beatles’ apparent lack of restriction (and lack of tolerance for having others impose restrictions upon them) is actually counterproductive to their efforts to complete the recording of the album. At a loss for articulating in concrete terms what may be obstructing the group from performing as well as they could, Paul wonders if they can only be cured of their repression and/or indecision if they are thrust unexpectedly into a foreign situation and forced by circumstance to adapt and improve unquestioningly, as they experienced in the early days of the band.</p>\n<p>(Note: An edited segment of this discussion was later included in the official Let It Be documentary. Overall, the reality of John and Paul’s exchange is less one-sided than it may seem in the film; this excerpt in itself is but a portion of it, and it shortly after expands to include George as well when he arrives at the studio.)</p>\n<h3 id=\"dialogue\">Dialogue</h3>\n<p>JOHN: I can’t wait to work, here, you know.</p>\n<p>PAUL: Yeah.</p>\n<p>JOHN: Either… Anyway, you know. I just can’t wait to just—</p>\n<p>PAUL: Do it.</p>\n<p>JOHN: —have it, you know.</p>\n<p>PAUL: Yeah, but so… Hmm. But I’m just talking about this thing, like this thing we’ve entered upon now, we still haven’t got any aim for it, except another album, again. Our only aim, ever, is an album. Which is like a very non-visual thing, it’s very sort of… But it’s great, isn’t it, and we do albums, then. But—</p>\n<p>JOHN: But albums is what we’re doing, at the moment.</p>\n<p>PAUL: [uneasy] Yeah, but I don’t know. Like—</p>\n<p>JOHN: I mean, that’s what we [inaudible] talk about.</p>\n<p>PAUL: —like I was saying the other day, is that you – is that you – you— [hesitating] We’re into albums as the four of us, but I really think we could be into other things. But every time I talk about it, I really sound like I’m the showbiz correspondent, trying to hustle us to do a Judy Garland comeback, you know. But really, all I mean is – well, look, let’s get – let’s change, or let’s go into a studio, like a vision studio, after we’ve learnt all of these, that’s just as good as this for sound, that’s got the same sort of thinking…</p>\n<p>JOHN: I think it’s daft to move from this one, you know, I mean—</p>\n<p>PAUL: But it’s like we got much better takes after we moved from Twickenham to here.</p>\n<p>JOHN: Oh, yeah, but I mean here, in our life it’s like home, you know.</p>\n<p>PAUL: Yeah, sure, but our takes are getting not as good. So I’m just trying to think of a remedy.</p>\n<p>JOHN: Yes, but it’s up to Glyn to take it.</p>\n<p>PAUL: Which he has been doing all yesterday, now, and ‘Get Back’, like you said, you know, we’re not in it.</p>\n<p>JOHN: Yeah, but that depends on the day.</p>\n<p>PAUL: But the thing that puts us in it are the things – the only ever thing that has put us in it is a novelty. We’re, you know—</p>\n<p>JOHN: Yes, yes.</p>\n<p>PAUL: We’re ve– we work on novelty. If there’s a new approach, if he says, “Take”, we take for the first time.</p>\n<p>JOHN: Mm.</p>\n<p>PAUL: Oh, you know, I mean, we’re gonna be great in the rough dubs, these, because we don’t care, you know, and it’s great. And now it’s gonna be very hard to better those – that dub we’ve got. There’s just so much in it, even ‘Teddy Boy’, not having words. It’s just, there’s so much in all of that.</p>\n<p>JOHN: Yeah. Yeah, I have to agree—</p>\n<p>PAUL: And it’s like, it’s gonna be hard to better it.</p>\n<p>JOHN: —but I don’t think another move is gonna be the answer. It’s just like every—[inaudible]</p>\n<p>PAUL: You see, I said to Michael that he should really just—just black this, just make this black one day, so that when we come in in the morning, it’s – “What is it?” I mean, you know. You’ve got to be sneaky with the Beatles, or else we’ll just go on forever in a circle. We really won’t get out of it. ‘Cause whenever we talk about it, we have certain rules – like George was saying. “What do you want to do?” And he says, “No films.” But it’s wrong, that. It’s very wrong, though, because you don’t know. He says – what he means is, “No Help! or Hard Day’s,” and I agree, you know. But like, films – ‘cause this is a film – and he now doesn’t mind this.</p>\n<p>JOHN: Yeah.</p>\n<p>PAUL: But it’s like – it’s that kind of thing, like no TV shows, no audience. But, I mean – see, it’s like when we came back from Hamburg and did Leicester Du Montfort Hall, or wherever it was, Coventry – we played the ballroom, and we had the worst first night then, and we were all nervous, and it was terrible. Then we played another the next night, and we got a little bit better; the next night, hmm; and then the next! [vocalising] It was just too much, and we got into the playing because we got over the hang-up of the audience, and it was just like there was no one there, but it was a ner– a new sort of thing, and there was some fella in the front watching how you were playing… you know? And you just – we were just right into it. And those would have been – if we could have recorded those things, they will have been the greatest, because it is. It’s like Mal was saying, he said, “It’s the bounce thing,” you know. And we’re good at that, you know, once we get over the nervousness. But it’s like, it’s the hurdle of that nervousness is there, now. So that… you know. [hesitating] We’re – we can’t get over it now, unless – well, unless we really sort of, like, go to the Albert Hall and get in a black bag, you know.</p>\n<p>JOHN: Mm.</p>\n<p>PAUL: There’s no other way. We can’t think ourselves out of it. And we can’t sort of say, well, it will be alright. See, and then the only other alternative to that is to say, well, we don’t – we will never do it to an audience again. But if we intend to – to keep any sort of contact on that scene… [pause] Yeah. I do understand George’s just saying, “There’s no point,” you know, because it is like we’re Stravinsky, and it’s in the music. And he doesn’t sort of get up and play his ‘Joanna’ for them anymore. He just writes it, and just sort of maybe occasionally conducts it.</p>\n<p>JOHN: But as long as there’s a good reason – like George wants to do a heavy show, like Dylan and Presley, all that.</p>\n<p>PAUL: Mm.</p>\n<p>JOHN: And that’ll be a large – I don’t know, like, I mean, that – that’s all this.</p>\n<p>PAUL: Mm, yeah, I know, yeah. that’s always – that’s always just—</p>\n<p>JOHN: Okay, yeah.</p>\n<p>PAUL: That’s us again, you know.</p>\n<p>JOHN: Yes, I know.</p>\n<p>PAUL: It’s us going silly again.</p>\n<p>JOHN: It is, and I think – I think we might do it.</p>\n<p>PAUL: Yeah, sure, but I mean the thing is they could do that one after you’ve done your own one, you know.</p>\n<p>JOHN: Yes, yeah. But I think that—</p>\n<p>PAUL: It’s like, it’s like this thing, man. There is a show to be had out of what we’ve got here, which is just so incredible. It’s unbelievable. And you don’t have to go on the roof, you don’t have to go anywhere. You really only have to sing ‘em. And combined with the documentary material leading up to it, it’s just like an unbelievable thing. Because you’ll have the two elements and you’ve got it there, and there’s no – we don’t need any need to move from here. But somehow we need to get us for the – see, it’s like we’ve got all the lead-up, and the only thing we haven’t got for every song is the – the song, yet.</p>\n<h3 id=\"notes\">Notes</h3>\n<p>This extensive conversation is one of the most revealing about the Beatles’ creative process and their internal struggles. Paul articulates his frustration that the band only works when faced with novelty or external pressure, and can’t motivate themselves through pure intention. His insight that “you’ve got to be sneaky with the Beatles” acknowledges their resistance to being managed or directed. John’s position that Apple Studios is “like home” reveals his desire for comfort over challenge. Paul’s Hamburg analogy—where repeated performances dissolved their nervousness—shows he understands they need the pressure of an audience to transcend their current malaise. The exchange is circular, exhausting, and ultimately unresolved, foreshadowing the band’s inability to find a sustainable working method.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"2\">2</h2>\n<h3 id=\"overview-1\">Overview</h3>\n<p>January 29th, 1969: John and Paul work carefully on their vocal harmony for the refrain of ‘Dig A Pony’. John, whose voice is tired and strained, is self-deprecating about his own efforts. Paul, perhaps attuned to it, is quick to profess his admiration for the song.</p>\n<h3 id=\"dialogue-1\">Dialogue</h3>\n<p>JOHN &#x26; PAUL: All I want is you…</p>\n<p>JOHN: But see, now we get into adding a little bit more paint, you know.</p>\n<p>PAUL: It’s alright, yeah. No, that’s good, that one.</p>\n<p>JOHN: Okay, tick it.</p>\n<p>PAUL: [sincere] I love that one.</p>\n<p>JOHN: [reticent] Thank you.</p>\n<p>PAUL: [insistent] I really really do.</p>\n<p>JOHN: Thank you. [quiet] I enjoy it too. Sometimes. [pause] So that’s done.</p>\n<p>PAUL: Um—</p>\n<p>JOHN: Next, please</p>\n<h3 id=\"notes-1\">Notes</h3>\n<p>A tender moment. Paul’s insistent praise for ‘Dig A Pony’ meets John’s self-deprecating reticence. John’s admission that he enjoys his own song “sometimes” reveals his insecurity and perhaps his altered emotional state (possibly due to heroin use). Paul’s repeated reassurance shows care and support, but John deflects with “Next, please,” unable to accept the compliment fully.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"3\">3</h2>\n<h3 id=\"overview-2\">Overview</h3>\n<p>January 29th, 1969 (Apple Studios, London): With some reservation (and/or hesitation), George expresses his desire to record and release an album of solo material after the sessions for Get Back/Let It Be are concluded, in mind of all the songs he’s written and accumulated over the years. John and Yoko support the idea, but George (perhaps sensing that John’s perception of “going solo” and what it symbolises is more absolute than his own) elaborates that he thinks it’d be a good thing not just for each member of the band, but for the Beatles as a band proper—they would be able to both free themselves creatively in their own personal outlets as well as play and record as a group without feeling stifled, innately in tune with one another.</p>\n<p>(In other words, the band doesn’t have to sever all ties to go their own way. Ultimately, it’s difficult to determine if George is merely expressing, in a carefully unassuming way, his own intentions for individuation in light of John’s recent solo output with Yoko and growing estrangement from the Beatles family, or if he is making a discrete appeal to John of making up instead of breaking up, and is still, despite all of the Beatles’ overlapping troubles over the past two years, not least the past two weeks, genuinely attuned to the idea of the band staying together.)</p>\n<h3 id=\"dialogue-2\">Dialogue</h3>\n<p>GEORGE: John.</p>\n<p>JOHN: Yeah?</p>\n<p>GEORGE: I tell you what I’d like to do. After this—</p>\n<p>PAUL: After this TV—?</p>\n<p>GEORGE: —after this show. Um, you know, I’ve got so many songs that I’ve got, like, my quota of tunes for the next ten – you know, years, or albums.</p>\n<p>JOHN: Yeah.</p>\n<p>GEORGE: And I’d just like to maybe do an album, of songs.</p>\n<p>JOHN: Of – on your own?</p>\n<p>GEORGE: Yeah.</p>\n<p>JOHN: Yeah.</p>\n<p>GEORGE: But I mean, I’d like it so that if… uh… [long pause] ‘Cause it would be nice, it would be nice to mainly get them all out of the way—</p>\n<p>JOHN: Yeah. It’d be nice anyway.</p>\n<p>GEORGE: And secondly, just to hear what I – what all mine are like all together.</p>\n<p>JOHN: Yeah, as long – you see, it’s good.

They talk about ‘Golden Slumbers’ and the originally intended music-hall feel of ‘Carry That Weight’. Paul imagines a verse about getting drunk and waking with “a weight upon my head,” then undercuts the drama with trivial everyday troubles.\r\n\r\n### Dialogue\r\n\r\nPAUL: That really should be like a fairy tale. “Once upon a time there lived a princess and…” Once upon a time / There lived a king / “Sleep pretty darling do not cry / And I will sing a lullaby.”\r\n\r\nMAL: [laughs] And the king will sing a lullaby. \r\n\r\n…\r\n\r\nPAUL AND RINGO: And this is why she said… She said, “Boy, you’re gonna carry that weight, carry that weight a long time…”\r\n\r\nPAUL: Like their troubles, all their troubles.

Mal connects Paul’s “winding road” to The Wizard of Oz and the Yellow Brick Road; Michael pushes Paul on how the song should end. Paul arrives at the idea of being led back to the door.\r\n\r\n### Dialogue\r\n\r\nPAUL: See I was thinking of having another – like the weather obstacle. \r\n\r\nMICHAEL: It’s beautiful. What’s it called?\r\n\r\nPAUL: ‘The Long And Winding Road’. [tries playing; falters] The only trouble is I always think of the… The storm clouds and the rain / Break up over the winding road… [trails off]\r\n\r\n…\r\n\r\nPAUL: I suppose it should still be about this sort of winding road. I’ve just got that picture – just the winding road that leads to your door, it will never disappear, I’ve seen that road before, it’ll always lead me here, lead me to your door. [audio feedback] Oh no!\r\n\r\nRINGO: [laughs] It’s a start.\r\n\r\nMAL: What you’re talking is sort of like The Wizard of Oz. Did you ever see The Wizard of Oz?\r\n\r\nPAUL: No no no, I didn’t, but I’ve—\r\n\r\nMAL: ‘The Yellow Brick Road’?\r\n\r\nPAUL: Yeah. I know. \r\n\r\nMAL: ‘The Long And Winding Road’. \r\n\r\nMICHAEL: It’s great. \r\n\r\nPAUL: You see, it’s also something… [starts playing again]\r\n\r\nMAL: It’s got that feel about it, you know? [inaudible] —so [Dorothy] gets back to, back to the boys— [inaudible] —and she’s never going to see them again.\r\n\r\nMICHAEL: Yeah, yeah, exactly. \r\n\r\nMAL: It’s a terrible feeling. \r\n\r\nMICHAEL: Heartbreaker, yeah. It’s great.\r\n\r\nMAL: It made me cry.\r\n\r\n…\r\n\r\nPAUL: It could be like the thing that’s up ahead. The thing that’s up ahead / At the end of the road… \r\n\r\nMAL: Like, how about like the obstacles on the road, that you’re going over?\r\n\r\nPAUL: No, but I think the obstacles – eh, you know. I have enough obstacles without putting them in the song. [laughs] \r\n\r\nMICHAEL: How’s it going to end? Is it going to end happily, or just – not sure yet? Is that the end?\r\n\r\nPAUL: No, it should end something like this. But still they lead me back / To the long and winding road / You left me waiting here / A long long time ago / Don’t leave me standing here / Lead me to your door…\r\n\r\n### Notes\r\n\r\nShows Paul’s reluctance to make metaphors too literal (“I have enough obstacles without putting them in the song”) but also how receptive he is to Mal’s emotional framing of the song as a “heartbreaker” about lost paths.","src/content/research/get-back-dialogue-day-to-day/day-5-get-back.md","8c09e65aaacb39fd",{html:4048,metadata:4049},"<h2 id=\"1\">1</h2>\n<h3 id=\"overview\">Overview</h3>\n<p>January 9th, 1969 (Twickenham Film Studios, London): With John and George yet to arrive, Mal and Ringo sit with Paul at the piano as he works on lyrics for the middle eight of ‘The Long And Winding Road’.

[starts playing jaunty piano] Boy, you’re gonna carry that weight / Carry that weight a long time…</p>\n<p>…</p>\n<p>PAUL: See, I think there might a verse about, I got drunk, I got in trouble with the wife, got drunk, so on and so on and so on, and it all goes to the next morning with a weight upon my head, and I found out it was my head. [laughs; starts playing jaunty piano] Boy, you’re gonna carry that weight / Carry that weight a long time… Just sort of normal kind of troubles that everyone has, and then just boy, you’re gonna…</p>\n<p>…</p>\n<p>PAUL: But it could be one of those things where, you know like in those songs where you’ve got everything, and everything’s going so great, but like, “This morning, one of my eggs broke,” you know.

I’ve just got that picture – just the winding road that leads to your door, it will never disappear, I’ve seen that road before, it’ll always lead me here, lead me to your door. [audio feedback] Oh no!</p>\n<p>RINGO: [laughs] It’s a start.</p>\n<p>MAL: What you’re talking is sort of like The Wizard of Oz. Did you ever see The Wizard of Oz?</p>\n<p>PAUL: No no no, I didn’t, but I’ve—</p>\n<p>MAL: ‘The Yellow Brick Road’?</p>\n<p>PAUL: Yeah. I know.</p>\n<p>MAL: ‘The Long And Winding Road’.</p>\n<p>MICHAEL: It’s great.</p>\n<p>PAUL: You see, it’s also something… [starts playing again]</p>\n<p>MAL: It’s got that feel about it, you know?

I have enough obstacles without putting them in the song. [laughs]</p>\n<p>MICHAEL: How’s it going to end? Is it going to end happily, or just – not sure yet? Is that the end?</p>\n<p>PAUL: No, it should end something like this.

George tries repeatedly to offer ideas and grows frustrated as his suggestions are overridden or deferred. This is the first major “Paul vs. George” creative friction in the Get Back/Let It Be sessions.\r\n\r\n### Dialogue\r\n\r\nGEORGE: If what you’re saying is what [John] said, then it’s easy, ’cause if you don’t know the words, then he tells you what you’re saying.\r\n\r\nPAUL: Yeah I know, but you see, like you said, it was corny before, and so to change the corniness, I was changing the words—\r\n\r\nGEORGE: Yeah, but the corny beginsel I thought was the notes that he was doing, you know, and the way he was doing it, not really what he was saying— \r\n\r\nPAUL: Yeah. So – okay.\r\n\r\nGEORGE: —and if it seems good, it doesn’t matter what—\r\n\r\nPAUL: What I’m trying to say is, you can get – I think you can get around the beginsel by singing the corny notes first, and having new words, and – you know. So I’m – but it’s like – so we still have to try and do it. So you still keep saying it’s wrong. Well, let’s try it. And then when we’ve tried it, then we can see if it’s wrong, you know.\r\n\r\nGEORGE: You already seem to have tried it a lot.\r\n\r\nPAUL: Yeah, I know, but we haven’t – we still haven’t done this. I’m in love for the first time in my life. “Don’t you know it’s gonna last.” [pause] “I’ll never let it get away.” [laughs] It’s a love that lasts forever…\r\n\r\nJOHN: “Forever and a day.”\r\n\r\nPAUL: Yeah. There’s some – there’s some new words there. And – and guitar–\r\n\r\nJOHN: I just haven’t tied to a way of singing yet.\r\n\r\nPAUL: No, that’s what I mean, you know, that’s all I want – to just have them–\r\n\r\nJOHN: Can you both do it, ’cause – okay.\r\n\r\nPAUL: Yeah. I’m in love for the first time…\r\n\r\nPAUL & GEORGE: For the first time in my life…\r\n\r\nJOHN: Don’t you know it’s gonna last…\r\n\r\nPAUL & GEORGE: Don’t ever let it get away…\r\n\r\nJOHN: It’s a love that lasts forever…\r\n\r\nGEORGE: I just wanna say— [playing halts]\r\n\r\nPAUL: [to George] I just want to get a bit – we’ll try, you know. We’ll go right through. But you keep talking about it. \r\n\r\nGEORGE: You see, if he was, say, if it was like— [plays different rhythm] Like that, you know. “You know it’s gonna last.”\r\n\r\nPAUL: [impatient] Yeah, sure, let’s just repeat whatever you say.\r\n\r\nGEORGE: Don’t you know it’s gonna last…\r\n\r\nJOHN & PAUL: I’m in love for the first time…\r\n\r\nPAUL & GEORGE: For the first time in my life…\r\n\r\nJOHN: Don’t you know it’s gonna last…\r\n\r\nPAUL & GEORGE: Don’t you know it’s gonna last…\r\n\r\nJOHN: It’s a love that lasts forever…\r\n\r\nPAUL & GEORGE: It’s a love that lasts forever…\r\n\r\nJOHN: It’s a love that has no past…\r\n\r\nPAUL & GEORGE: It’s a love that has no past…\r\n\r\nJOHN: Don’t let me down… [playing halts]\r\n\r\nPAUL: Okay, that’s – that’s alright. That’s—\r\n\r\nJOHN: Yes. [to George] I can’t hear you.\r\n\r\nGEORGE: Right.\r\n\r\nPAUL: No, uh—\r\n\r\nGEORGE: I think it’s awful. I’m trying to get it started—\r\n\r\nPAUL: Uh… okay.\r\n\r\nJOHN: [to George] Well, have you got anything? To supplant it?\r\n\r\nPAUL: [to George] Okay, yeah, come on. Do something better, then.\r\n\r\nGEORGE: Well, I just think that, you know– I think, for a start, it’d be better to sing – [plays descending chords] instead of— [plays repeating chords] Ah… For the first time…\r\n\r\nPAUL: Yeah, but see, in a way, that’s even cornier, I think. That – that little harmony bit, it’s just too – it’s too pretty.\r\n\r\nGEORGE: Well it’s just there’s one holding – it’s like that. [plays staggered chords] I mean at the moment, it’s just— [plays straight chords] And maybe it’s cornier if you do [plays staggered chords], a groove like that—\r\n\r\nPAUL: Yeah.\r\n\r\nGEORGE: But if it’s something like that— [plays sustained chords]\r\n\r\nPAUL: Okay. Now for the first time in my life… One, two, three – you take the lower one, then.\r\n\r\nJOHN: I’m in love for the first time…\r\n\r\nPAUL & GEORGE: I’m in love for the first time…\r\n\r\nJOHN: Don’t you know it’s gonna last…\r\n\r\nPAUL & GEORGE: Don’t you know it’s gonna last…\r\n\r\nJOHN: It’s a love that lasts forever…\r\n\r\nPAUL & GEORGE: It’s a love that lasts forever…\r\n\r\nJOHN: It’s a love that has no past!\r\n\r\nPAUL & GEORGE: It’s a love that has no past… [playing halts]\r\n\r\nGEORGE: I thought we should do something like this— [plays different rhythm]\r\n\r\nPAUL: No. You see—\r\n\r\nGEORGE: [continues playing] It’s a love that lasts forever, love that lasts forever, love that lasts forever…\r\n\r\nJOHN: [unconvinced] Yeah, well, that’s it. [pause] I think you should just get a corny one first, and then start doing that bit. You know, you’ll start to get the rhythm to it, and then sort of change it.\r\n\r\nGEORGE: [plays differently] Love that’s gonna last… Da da da da da da…\r\n\r\nPAUL: Yeah, that’s it. [George continues playing] Uh… [George’s playing halts] Let’s just sing, you know, the corny one. [laughs]\r\n\r\nJOHN: Yeah, do the corny one.\r\n\r\nPAUL: Just to get this bit, you know. And then we can like – you see, that’s it. We’ll make it better as it goes on.\r\n\r\nJOHN: Yeah. I mean – I—\r\n\r\nPAUL: But if we don’t, then it just doesn’t go on. You know, we’ve just gone round for like an hour, with nothing in our heads. Just— And we’re back, you know. So let’s—\r\n\r\nGEORGE: I can keep doing the permutations, then.\r\n\r\nPAUL: Yeah, I know, but let’s just sort of move on, now. Let’s just get this.\r\n\r\nJOHN: I’d like to hear any of ‘em – right ones.\r\n\r\nPAUL: Yeah. Right, okay. So repeat exactly what he says, but then we can’t, on one of the lines. So, I’m in love for the first time…\r\n\r\nGEORGE: See, that’s why you don’t get any further, because you just kept using the same lines against the one that doesn’t work—\r\n\r\nPAUL: [ignores] For the first time in my life…\r\n\r\nJOHN: Don’t you know it’s gonna last…\r\n\r\nGEORGE: [grudging] It’s a love that’s gonna last…\r\n\r\nJOHN: It’s a love that lasts forever…\r\n\r\nPAUL & GEORGE: It’s a love that lasts forever…\r\n\r\nJOHN: It’s a love that has no past… [playing halts] Love that lasts forever, love that lasts…\r\n\r\nPAUL: Okay, so how about, how about – changing ‘round these two, and when you sing, “don’t you know it’s gonna last,” we sing, “it’s a love that has no past.” And then we repeat, “it’s a love that lasts forever,” exactly. And then when you sing, “it’s a love that has no past,” we sing “it’s a love that’s gonna last.”\r\n\r\nJOHN: Yes. I agree.\r\n\r\nPAUL: Okay? So, I’m in love for the— “Love for the first time in my life.” “It’s a love that has no past.” Swap that one for the other. So that when he’s singing that, we’re singing the other. Then, “it’s a love that lasts forever,” repeat that – even though it sounds funny, it’ll be alright. And then, “don’t you know it’s gonna last.” Just try it through, roughly.\r\n\r\nGEORGE: I’m trying to—\r\n\r\nPAUL: Listen – uh, uh.\r\n\r\nJOHN: I’m in love for the first time…\r\n\r\nPAUL & GEORGE: Love for the first time in my life…\r\n\r\nJOHN: Don’t you know it’s gonna last…\r\n\r\nPAUL & GEORGE: It’s a love that has no past…\r\n\r\nJOHN: It’s a love that lasts forever… [playing halts]\r\n\r\nPAUL: Okay, uh, The only time that works, really, is on the last line. So we sing, “love for the first time—” Just, just try it all exactly as it is. Repeating that. We’ll just on the last time. Sing, repeat, “it’s a love that’s gonna last,” and then you say, “it’s a love that has no past.”\r\n\r\nJOHN: Okay.\r\n\r\nPAUL: You see, it’s verging between ridiculous and alright, that, you know. Singing different words. ’Cause it is like—\r\n\r\nJOHN: That’s the bones of it, though. [inaudible; playing guitar] She’s in, she’s in pain, you know. [laughs]\r\n\r\nPAUL: [laughs] Okay.\r\n\r\nJOHN: I’m in love for the first time…\r\n\r\nPAUL & GEORGE: For the first time in my life…\r\n\r\nJOHN: Don’t you know it’s gonna last…\r\n\r\nPAUL & GEORGE: Don’t you know it’s gonna last…\r\n\r\nJOHN: It’s a love that lasts forever…\r\n\r\nPAUL & GEORGE: It’s a love that lasts forever…\r\n\r\nJOHN: It’s a love that has no past…\r\n\r\nPAUL & GEORGE: It’s a love that’s gonna last…\r\n\r\nGEORGE: Can I make a suggestion there, for the last line?\r\n\r\nPAUL: What?\r\n\r\nGEORGE: Well, forget the last line. It’s a love that lasts forever…\r\n\r\nPAUL: It’s a love that has no past… dun dun dun dun dun dun. Don’t let me down… Okay.\r\n\r\n### Notes\r\n\r\nEarly, extended Paul–George conflict around arrangement and “corniness” of ‘Don’t Let Me Down’ chorus. Shows John siding musically with Paul while trying to mediate, and George’s growing feeling that he can’t get ideas through.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 2\r\n\r\n### Overview\r\n\r\nFurther work on the ‘Don’t Let Me Down’ chorus. George is skeptical about the arrangement; Paul insists it will be improved and focuses on rhythm and weak spots. John supports Paul’s assessment that the problem is structural rather than purely melodic.\r\n\r\n### Dialogue\r\n\r\nPAUL: So that’s – that’s near enough for the time being. [inaudible]\r\n\r\nJOHN: We’ve still got that hole, like at the—\r\n\r\nGEORGE: But really, it’s like that doesn’t sound all that… you know. I’m iffy on that.\r\n\r\nPAUL: Well, we’re gonna improve on that. But the—\r\n\r\nGEORGE: If we had a tape recorder now – just tape down, play it back, you’d throw that out straightaway.\r\n\r\nPAUL: Yeah, right, but—\r\n\r\nGEORGE: You know, really—\r\n\r\nPAUL: Yeah—\r\n\r\nGEORGE: —you’d throw it out right damn in—\r\n\r\nPAUL: Okay. Uh. Well, okay, that’s the—\r\n\r\nGEORGE: You know, it’s either be— I know, you know.\r\n\r\nPAUL: Yeah, I know, but you— [makes helpless sound]\r\n\r\nJOHN: [mediating] See, I think, there… [starts playing]\r\n\r\nPAUL: [to John] Give in!\r\n\r\nGEORGE: I’m in love for the first time…\r\n\r\nPAUL: I give in.\r\n\r\nJOHN: We’re right, but it’s wrong there, on that bit.\r\n\r\nGEORGE: You see, the first one’s not bad. [playing halts]\r\n\r\nJOHN: No, the thing that we’ve done is that we found out that’s the weak bit, right.\r\n\r\nPAUL: Yeah.\r\n\r\nJOHN: So we tried putting voices on it. But it’s still down to the rhythm, somehow. The ba— Love for the first time… [starts playing]\r\n\r\nPAUL: But it was always weak on your guitar.\r\n\r\nJOHN: [agreeing] Yeah, sure.\r\n\r\nPAUL: That’s the weak bit of the song, that.\r\n\r\n### Notes\r\n\r\nShorter exchange that crystallizes the structural problem with the chorus and John’s view of it as a “weak bit” in need of rhythmic, not just vocal, adjustment. Continues the pattern of George’s skepticism and Paul’s insistence that the part can be refined.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 3\r\n\r\n### Overview\r\n\r\nPaul, George, and John argue over process: whether to keep playing through a “confused” arrangement or stop and methodically fix parts. Paul is acutely aware that he sounds like a director; George insists you only find what works by playing. John acts as mediator and offers practical suggestions (vamping, structure), while Paul openly worries about filming and time pressure.\r\n\r\n### Dialogue\r\n\r\nPAUL: You see, we’re really – we’re gonna have to sorta bring it together, because we’re all at odds, we’re doing that thing we did on The Beatles, we’re all playing, you know, like… [incoherent] Like in this verse, it’s two harmonies singing, trying to say some words, right. So like you know, you can just, duh duh dun… ch cha. And in the bits, when we need bits, we’re not—\r\n\r\nJOHN: Yeah I know the bits. I’m just trying to sing it, and do it through.\r\n\r\nPAUL: [plays] You know what I mean? We’ve got to get riffs, when the riff bits come up.\r\n\r\nGEORGE: The riffs. Uh, there’s no riffs. I mean, it’s nice to get – just to get what you’re playing—\r\n\r\nPAUL: No, but it’s just, look – you see, “you and I”, uh – on—\r\n\r\nGEORGE: You and I, our memories…\r\n\r\nPAUL: Uh, but it’s not – it’s not together, you see, so it’s not sounding together. Even on—\r\n\r\nGEORGE: So we can only play until we – until we can find the bit—\r\n\r\nPAUL: Or we can stop and say it’s not together.\r\n\r\nGEORGE: Yes, then you’ve got to carry on until we get it together. So I mean, that’s all, that’s all I can do is play—\r\n\r\nPAUL: Okay. Well, I, you know—\r\n\r\nGEORGE: —until it sounds as though it’s blending with the rest—\r\n\r\nPAUL: I never know what to say to that, you know, ’cause what I want to say is now come on, and play… you know.\r\n\r\nGEORGE: Yes, I know.\r\n\r\nPAUL: But I can’t, you know, because we get into that line.\r\n\r\nGEORGE: It does.\r\n\r\nPAUL: Okay. [laughs nervously] So, here we go. [starts playing] You know, I mean, well. Tell us something about that. I can’t make it eyond that. It’s like, it’s – it’s complicated now. So. See, if we can get simpler, and then complicate it where it needs complications, but it’s complicated in the bit—\r\n\r\nGEORGE: It’s not complicated. I’m just gonna—\r\n\r\nPAUL: I know, but I mean – you know.\r\n\r\nGEORGE: I mean, I’ll play just the chords, if you’ll like, and—\r\n\r\nPAUL: [hushed] No, come on, you always get like—\r\n\r\nGEORGE: —and then – but that’s all I’m trying to do—\r\n\r\nPAUL: [anxious] You always get annoyed when I say that. I’m – I’m trying to help, you know, but I always hear myself annoying you, and I’m trying to—\r\n\r\nGEORGE: No, you’re not annoying me.\r\n\r\nPAUL: —I get so I can’t say—\r\n\r\nGEORGE: [acquiescent] You don’t annoy me [anymore?].\r\n\r\nPAUL: But you know what I mean. You know, well, do this, then. [plays] And then… I don’t know. [long pause] Yeah. I can’t do it on film, either. [laughs; bleak] I don’t know if I can do it on camera. [long silence; guitar playing]\r\n\r\nJOHN: Do you want me to keep this up? [plays riff] ’Cause I’m trying to find something that’s nice to sing to—\r\n\r\nPAUL: Yeah, you see, I don’t mind—\r\n\r\nJOHN: Yeah, and—\r\n\r\nPAUL: —but doesn’t everyone agree that it’s confused at the moment?\r\n\r\nJOHN: Yeah.\r\n\r\nPAUL: So all I’m trying to say is – is like, let’s get the confusion unconfusing, and then confuse it. You know, like, we’re just – this is what we’ve been doing all afternoon. This is why we’re not getting anything done. You know, we’re just rolling on with it. We’ve only got twelve more days. So you know, we’ve really got to do this methodically, this one. Like unconfused, then a bit more confused, then a bit more, now try this drumming here, try this drumming there, now okay, let’s stop and go look into this bit—\r\n\r\nJOHN: Well, I’ve got an idea. I should vamp, ’cause I’ve got to sing, and it’s hard going— [plays rhythm]\r\n\r\nPAUL: Doing that?\r\n\r\nJOHN: But it’s annoying, you know. And let me do it— [plays rhythm]\r\n\r\nPAUL: Okay, can you do that—\r\n\r\nJOHN: I’ll do just that kind of vamping. [plays rhythm]\r\n\r\nPAUL: Yeah. [laughs] Drag it halfway through candid camera. [long pause; listening to John playing] Yeah.\r\n\r\nJOHN: [reassuring] Forget about candid camera.\r\n\r\nPAUL: [wan] Can’t, though. [quietly; to George] But you see we’ve been saying— [inaudible] —a lot of, uh— [inaudible] —that I can do about. You know, it’s like I’ve always found that – but I always feel it, though, like you think I’m trying to put you down, or stop you from playing, but I’m not. I’m trying to stop us all playing, until we know what we’re playing.\r\n\r\nGEORGE: Yeah, but you’ve got to play it in order to find which fits and which doesn’t.\r\n\r\nPAUL: Mm.\r\n\r\nGEORGE: You see, that’s all you can do in this—\r\n\r\nPAUL: But it’s like – I know, but I’m thinking of this other thing which is where we’re playing the solos. We’re improvising the solos, but we’ll play strict chords and strict rhythms.\r\n\r\nGEORGE: Yeah.\r\n\r\nPAUL: Without the vocals.\r\n\r\nGEORGE: [inaudible; drowned out by playing]\r\n\r\nPAUL: You know, but I don’t want to say it, because I really just hear myself as being the only one saying it. Always. And I just basically sort of sit there, like— [inaudible; drowned out by playing] —and I never get any support or anything. So I just think, “Oh well. [inaudible]” You know. It’s right. [to John] And you know it’s right.\r\n\r\nJOHN: [consenting] Yes, alright, but I just don’t know what to do about it.\r\n\r\nPAUL: Well, you know.\r\n\r\nJOHN: You know, I mean, up ’til then—\r\n\r\nGEORGE: I mean, I’ll wait until you figure out your bits and then work my part out, if you like.\r\n\r\nPAUL: No no no—\r\n\r\nGEORGE: It’s like that, it’s like a matter of working it out with you while you’re working your bit out. You know, if you’ve got your bass bit. [plays] You know, I mean, so. It just would—\r\n\r\nPAUL: I know, I know, but I’m—\r\n\r\nGEORGE: Because it’ll take even longer in a way, if there—\r\n\r\nPAUL: Look, I’m not trying to say that, and I’m not trying to say that about you. You know, you’re doing this again as though I’m trying to say that, and what we said the other day, you know – I’m not trying to get [at] you. But what I really am trying to just say is, “Look, lads.” The band, you know. “Should we try it like this?” You know.\r\n\r\nGEORGE: It’s funny now how it only occurs when you put the – on—\r\n\r\nPAUL: I know, if this one is like, “Should we play guitar all through ‘Hey Jude’?” Well, I don’t think we should, but—\r\n\r\nGEORGE: Well, okay, I don’t mind, I’ll play, you know, whatever you want me to play. Or I won’t play at all, if you don’t want me to play. Now, whatever it is that will please you, I’ll do it. [pause] But I don’t think you really know what that one is. [long pause; playing]\r\n\r\nJOHN: [hedging] But do you want to take the [inaudible]?\r\n\r\nGEORGE: [singing quietly] Going nowhere…\r\n\r\nPAUL: [exasperated] No, okay, but don’t – come on. Look, you know—\r\n\r\nJOHN: The galloping bit. And I’ll just vamp.\r\n\r\nPAUL: Look, you know, the… [sighs] No, it’s not like that. You see, that’s it, it’s like, we can’t do this. We’ve really got to sort out this, ’cause we’re – this is  – we’re like – this is the one, you know. Now we’re rehearsing, and we’re trying to like get it together for a TV show, so we really – like you said, we’ve only been through four numbers, you know.\r\n\r\nGEORGE: Mm.\r\n\r\nJOHN: Well…\r\n\r\nPAUL: So we’ve probably got to get some system to get through like twenty, or thirty, and no more, and have learnt them. And it’s probably going to be like sculpture. So that we get all the chords. So we can all vamp and all. Then we can all play, like, every solo we need. But like… You know what I mean? It’s got to sound as though it’s improving.\r\n\r\nGEORGE: [careful] Yeah, well, it actually – it sounded to me, that for me, it was a waste of me time playing, when we started it today. I mean, I just started remembering then what it could get into the other day, after playing for around an hour, an hour and a half. And suddenly, you know, I just don’t find that my – that what I’m doing is starting to have something, you know. Have some structure to it. [pause] You know, that’s the thing.\r\n\r\nPAUL: Yeah, I know, I know what you mean, you know. ’Cause it’s like—\r\n\r\nGEORGE: You know, I mean—\r\n\r\nPAUL: It’s just that that way of doing it, you know, puts me off the way I’m trying to do it, and—\r\n\r\nGEORGE: [resigned] Well, that’s – you know. That’s all, then. I can only do me, in that one way, however I do it, you know. [long pause]\r\n\r\nPAUL: [resigned] Let’s do another song.\r\n\r\nGEORGE: [commiserating] No, come on, we just have to learn this—\r\n\r\nPAUL: No, no, it’s – let’s just do something else.\r\n\r\nGEORGE: Do you want to do… ‘Maxwell Silver Hammer’?\r\n\r\nJOHN: [encouraging] Well, let’s do this, ’cause then we – we’re gonna come to this, or whatever it is. And the thing is just try and think what – the stage we’ve got to be in then.\r\n\r\nPAUL: You just have to know that. I think we’ve wasted a lot of time, I think. I think we do like waste, physically waste a heck of a lot of time, you know, when the four of us are together.\r\n\r\n### Notes\r\n\r\nDefines the core “process” disagreement between Paul and George: stop and fix vs. play until it gels. Shows Paul’s anxiety about being the only one saying “this is confused,” his awareness of annoying George, and John’s role as mediator.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 4\r\n\r\n### Overview\r\n\r\nLater in the day, Paul, John, and George discuss leadership, songs as “your scene”, and the difficulty of being “the boss”. Paul acknowledges he has been effectively leading for a couple of years and is now scared of that role; George insists that Paul doesn’t “boss out” on them and that the group’s slowness is partly due to lack of clear direction.\r\n\r\n### Dialogue\r\n\r\nGEORGE: But that’s like, I’ve learnt that bit, and I’m trying to – I’m trying to take that – those chords along with it…\r\n\r\nPAUL: [inaudible; drowned out by George’s voice] I’m not trying to – I only want to ask you. You know.\r\n\r\nJOHN: I think, it’s your song. And you’ve gotta— [inaudible] —gotta have it exactly how he wants to do it, you know. If you say, “Don’t play that, play that,” it’s up to you, you know. You sort of take it. ’Cause it’s your scene. If somebody’s gonna ask for [inaudible], it’s his song.\r\n\r\nPAUL: But now I – now I’m scared of that. To be the boss. And I – and I have been, for like, uh, a couple of years. And we all have, you know. There’s no pretending about that.\r\n\r\nJOHN: Yeah I know, but – but this—\r\n\r\nPAUL: And no one is [the boss]. That is what we decided, you know. And no one is—\r\n\r\nJOHN: But it’s all in—\r\n\r\nPAUL: And no one’s – you know how rush— [audio cuts off] —and this is why, you know, it’s chaos—\r\n\r\nGEORGE: You don’t boss out on us. It’s fine.\r\n\r\nPAUL: Until it sort of… That’s why we take so long! Because, really, you know, and we get sort of – so that’s the thing. We can play it shitty and all. I – I think we can play it shitty like ten times, so it’s sort of in there, and then I think we can kind of play it quite good, then. But it’s only – I don’t know, it’s just like different approaches, you know. I think we’d be better just learn, just doing it all, like uh, you know, the Red Norvo Five. Just really, like, uh—\r\n\r\nGEORGE: Vamping away.\r\n\r\nPAUL: Vamping, sort of efficient vamping, really, you know, and then get the imaginative thing. You know. [pauses] But anyway, I know it’s impossible for us to go like – because we can’t get into the moment, ’cause you don’t do it like that, and— [plays riff]\r\n\r\nGEORGE: I know, and I’m trying, but— [plays]\r\n\r\nPAUL: No no no I mean, just, generally… [John sings ‘Two Of Us’ under his breath] It’s like when you’ve been trying to get me to do it and I do it. And that’s how I do it, but that’s not how you do it. [everyone plays]\r\n\r\nJOHN: [laughs; stops playing] See, I suppose that’s how they do it.\r\n\r\n### Notes\r\n\r\nImportant self-awareness moment for Paul about his reluctant leadership and fear of being “the boss”. John explicitly affirms the songwriter’s right to direct their own song; George tries to reassure Paul he doesn’t feel bossed.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 5\r\n\r\n### Overview\r\n\r\nPaul proposes a structural solution to conflicting working methods: each Beatle should have undivided creative direction over their own compositions, with improvisation agreed upon explicitly. George likes the idea; John prefers improvisation. Paul muses that their discord is “far further reaching” than just music.\r\n\r\n### Dialogue\r\n\r\nPAUL: [inaudible; drowned out by guitar] —of seeing yourself nearly go round a past you’ve been down too many times, you know I go down it, you know, like us going on about this. I really don’t want to go back to that. And it’s just silly. And I just can’t think of any solution out of here. The problem is that we should all arrange our own tunes, and if you want improvisation, then we should just say, you know, right, and—\r\n\r\nGEORGE: That’s the best way.\r\n\r\nPAUL: —and we improvise here. But look, it puts on much more work on each one of us, then, because then you’ve got to work out my bassline.\r\n\r\nJOHN: I’d say improvise it, like.\r\n\r\nPAUL: Yeah. [laughs bleakly] It’s like a bunch of theories, isn’t it? It’s like, it’s not just to do with playing music, this. It’s far further reaching, this sort of – this thing, you know.\r\n\r\nGEORGE: It’s always the far reaching end of it. It stems from the mad thing they call— [audio cuts off]\r\n\r\n### Notes\r\n\r\nSets up the idea (that will later partly come true) of each member having their own “domain” on their songs. Also shows Paul’s sense that their disagreements are metaphysical, not just technical.","src/content/research/get-back-dialogue-day-to-day/day-2-get-back.md","044d39bb21182037",{html:4083,metadata:4084},"<h2 id=\"1\">1</h2>\n<h3 id=\"overview\">Overview</h3>\n<p>John allies himself with Paul as they work through different lyric and harmony options for the chorus of ‘Don’t Let Me Down’. George tries repeatedly to offer ideas and grows frustrated as his suggestions are overridden or deferred. This is the first major “Paul vs. George” creative friction in the Get Back/Let It Be sessions.</p>\n<h3 id=\"dialogue\">Dialogue</h3>\n<p>GEORGE: If what you’re saying is what [John] said, then it’s easy, ’cause if you don’t know the words, then he tells you what you’re saying.</p>\n<p>PAUL: Yeah I know, but you see, like you said, it was corny before, and so to change the corniness, I was changing the words—</p>\n<p>GEORGE: Yeah, but the corny beginsel I thought was the notes that he was doing, you know, and the way he was doing it, not really what he was saying—</p>\n<p>PAUL: Yeah. So – okay.</p>\n<p>GEORGE: —and if it seems good, it doesn’t matter what—</p>\n<p>PAUL: What I’m trying to say is, you can get – I think you can get around the beginsel by singing the corny notes first, and having new words, and – you know. So I’m – but it’s like – so we still have to try and do it. So you still keep saying it’s wrong. Well, let’s try it. And then when we’ve tried it, then we can see if it’s wrong, you know.</p>\n<p>GEORGE: You already seem to have tried it a lot.</p>\n<p>PAUL: Yeah, I know, but we haven’t – we still haven’t done this. I’m in love for the first time in my life. “Don’t you know it’s gonna last.” [pause] “I’ll never let it get away.” [laughs] It’s a love that lasts forever…</p>\n<p>JOHN: “Forever and a day.”</p>\n<p>PAUL: Yeah. There’s some – there’s some new words there. And – and guitar–</p>\n<p>JOHN: I just haven’t tied to a way of singing yet.</p>\n<p>PAUL: No, that’s what I mean, you know, that’s all I want – to just have them–</p>\n<p>JOHN: Can you both do it, ’cause – okay.</p>\n<p>PAUL: Yeah. I’m in love for the first time…</p>\n<p>PAUL &#x26; GEORGE: For the first time in my life…</p>\n<p>JOHN: Don’t you know it’s gonna last…</p>\n<p>PAUL &#x26; GEORGE: Don’t ever let it get away…</p>\n<p>JOHN: It’s a love that lasts forever…</p>\n<p>GEORGE: I just wanna say— [playing halts]</p>\n<p>PAUL: [to George] I just want to get a bit – we’ll try, you know. We’ll go right through. But you keep talking about it.</p>\n<p>GEORGE: You see, if he was, say, if it was like— [plays different rhythm] Like that, you know. “You know it’s gonna last.”</p>\n<p>PAUL: [impatient] Yeah, sure, let’s just repeat whatever you say.</p>\n<p>GEORGE: Don’t you know it’s gonna last…</p>\n<p>JOHN &#x26; PAUL: I’m in love for the first time…</p>\n<p>PAUL &#x26; GEORGE: For the first time in my life…</p>\n<p>JOHN: Don’t you know it’s gonna last…</p>\n<p>PAUL &#x26; GEORGE: Don’t you know it’s gonna last…</p>\n<p>JOHN: It’s a love that lasts forever…</p>\n<p>PAUL &#x26; GEORGE: It’s a love that lasts forever…</p>\n<p>JOHN: It’s a love that has no past…</p>\n<p>PAUL &#x26; GEORGE: It’s a love that has no past…</p>\n<p>JOHN: Don’t let me down… [playing halts]</p>\n<p>PAUL: Okay, that’s – that’s alright. That’s—</p>\n<p>JOHN: Yes. [to George] I can’t hear you.</p>\n<p>GEORGE: Right.</p>\n<p>PAUL: No, uh—</p>\n<p>GEORGE: I think it’s awful. I’m trying to get it started—</p>\n<p>PAUL: Uh… okay.</p>\n<p>JOHN: [to George] Well, have you got anything? To supplant it?</p>\n<p>PAUL: [to George] Okay, yeah, come on. Do something better, then.</p>\n<p>GEORGE: Well, I just think that, you know– I think, for a start, it’d be better to sing – [plays descending chords] instead of— [plays repeating chords] Ah… For the first time…</p>\n<p>PAUL: Yeah, but see, in a way, that’s even cornier, I think. That – that little harmony bit, it’s just too – it’s too pretty.</p>\n<p>GEORGE: Well it’s just there’s one holding – it’s like that. [plays staggered chords] I mean at the moment, it’s just— [plays straight chords] And maybe it’s cornier if you do [plays staggered chords], a groove like that—</p>\n<p>PAUL: Yeah.</p>\n<p>GEORGE: But if it’s something like that— [plays sustained chords]</p>\n<p>PAUL: Okay. Now for the first time in my life… One, two, three – you take the lower one, then.</p>\n<p>JOHN: I’m in love for the first time…</p>\n<p>PAUL &#x26; GEORGE: I’m in love for the first time…</p>\n<p>JOHN: Don’t you know it’s gonna last…</p>\n<p>PAUL &#x26; GEORGE: Don’t you know it’s gonna last…</p>\n<p>JOHN: It’s a love that lasts forever…</p>\n<p>PAUL &#x26; GEORGE: It’s a love that lasts forever…</p>\n<p>JOHN: It’s a love that has no past!</p>\n<p>PAUL &#x26; GEORGE: It’s a love that has no past… [playing halts]</p>\n<p>GEORGE: I thought we should do something like this— [plays different rhythm]</p>\n<p>PAUL: No. You see—</p>\n<p>GEORGE: [continues playing] It’s a love that lasts forever, love that lasts forever, love that lasts forever…</p>\n<p>JOHN: [unconvinced] Yeah, well, that’s it. [pause] I think you should just get a corny one first, and then start doing that bit. You know, you’ll start to get the rhythm to it, and then sort of change it.</p>\n<p>GEORGE: [plays differently] Love that’s gonna last… Da da da da da da…</p>\n<p>PAUL: Yeah, that’s it. [George continues playing] Uh… [George’s playing halts] Let’s just sing, you know, the corny one. [laughs]</p>\n<p>JOHN: Yeah, do the corny one.</p>\n<p>PAUL: Just to get this bit, you know. And then we can like – you see, that’s it. We’ll make it better as it goes on.</p>\n<p>JOHN: Yeah. I mean – I—</p>\n<p>PAUL: But if we don’t, then it just doesn’t go on. You know, we’ve just gone round for like an hour, with nothing in our heads. Just— And we’re back, you know. So let’s—</p>\n<p>GEORGE: I can keep doing the permutations, then.</p>\n<p>PAUL: Yeah, I know, but let’s just sort of move on, now. Let’s just get this.</p>\n<p>JOHN: I’d like to hear any of ‘em – right ones.</p>\n<p>PAUL: Yeah. Right, okay. So repeat exactly what he says, but then we can’t, on one of the lines. So, I’m in love for the first time…</p>\n<p>GEORGE: See, that’s why you don’t get any further, because you just kept using the same lines against the one that doesn’t work—</p>\n<p>PAUL: [ignores] For the first time in my life…</p>\n<p>JOHN: Don’t you know it’s gonna last…</p>\n<p>GEORGE: [grudging] It’s a love that’s gonna last…</p>\n<p>JOHN: It’s a love that lasts forever…</p>\n<p>PAUL &#x26; GEORGE: It’s a love that lasts forever…</p>\n<p>JOHN: It’s a love that has no past… [playing halts] Love that lasts forever, love that lasts…</p>\n<p>PAUL: Okay, so how about, how about – changing ‘round these two, and when you sing, “don’t you know it’s gonna last,” we sing, “it’s a love that has no past.” And then we repeat, “it’s a love that lasts forever,” exactly. And then when you sing, “it’s a love that has no past,” we sing “it’s a love that’s gonna last.”</p>\n<p>JOHN: Yes. I agree.</p>\n<p>PAUL: Okay? So, I’m in love for the— “Love for the first time in my life.” “It’s a love that has no past.” Swap that one for the other. So that when he’s singing that, we’re singing the other. Then, “it’s a love that lasts forever,” repeat that – even though it sounds funny, it’ll be alright. And then, “don’t you know it’s gonna last.” Just try it through, roughly.</p>\n<p>GEORGE: I’m trying to—</p>\n<p>PAUL: Listen – uh, uh.</p>\n<p>JOHN: I’m in love for the first time…</p>\n<p>PAUL &#x26; GEORGE: Love for the first time in my life…</p>\n<p>JOHN: Don’t you know it’s gonna last…</p>\n<p>PAUL &#x26; GEORGE: It’s a love that has no past…</p>\n<p>JOHN: It’s a love that lasts forever… [playing halts]</p>\n<p>PAUL: Okay, uh, The only time that works, really, is on the last line. So we sing, “love for the first time—” Just, just try it all exactly as it is. Repeating that. We’ll just on the last time. Sing, repeat, “it’s a love that’s gonna last,” and then you say, “it’s a love that has no past.”</p>\n<p>JOHN: Okay.</p>\n<p>PAUL: You see, it’s verging between ridiculous and alright, that, you know. Singing different words. ’Cause it is like—</p>\n<p>JOHN: That’s the bones of it, though. [inaudible; playing guitar] She’s in, she’s in pain, you know. [laughs]</p>\n<p>PAUL: [laughs] Okay.</p>\n<p>JOHN: I’m in love for the first time…</p>\n<p>PAUL &#x26; GEORGE: For the first time in my life…</p>\n<p>JOHN: Don’t you know it’s gonna last…</p>\n<p>PAUL &#x26; GEORGE: Don’t you know it’s gonna last…</p>\n<p>JOHN: It’s a love that lasts forever…</p>\n<p>PAUL &#x26; GEORGE: It’s a love that lasts forever…</p>\n<p>JOHN: It’s a love that has no past…</p>\n<p>PAUL &#x26; GEORGE: It’s a love that’s gonna last…</p>\n<p>GEORGE: Can I make a suggestion there, for the last line?</p>\n<p>PAUL: What?</p>\n<p>GEORGE: Well, forget the last line. It’s a love that lasts forever…</p>\n<p>PAUL: It’s a love that has no past… dun dun dun dun dun dun.

[inaudible]</p>\n<p>JOHN: We’ve still got that hole, like at the—</p>\n<p>GEORGE: But really, it’s like that doesn’t sound all that… you know. I’m iffy on that.</p>\n<p>PAUL: Well, we’re gonna improve on that. But the—</p>\n<p>GEORGE: If we had a tape recorder now – just tape down, play it back, you’d throw that out straightaway.</p>\n<p>PAUL: Yeah, right, but—</p>\n<p>GEORGE: You know, really—</p>\n<p>PAUL: Yeah—</p>\n<p>GEORGE: —you’d throw it out right damn in—</p>\n<p>PAUL: Okay. Uh. Well, okay, that’s the—</p>\n<p>GEORGE: You know, it’s either be— I know, you know.</p>\n<p>PAUL: Yeah, I know, but you— [makes helpless sound]</p>\n<p>JOHN: [mediating] See, I think, there… [starts playing]</p>\n<p>PAUL: [to John] Give in!</p>\n<p>GEORGE: I’m in love for the first time…</p>\n<p>PAUL: I give in.</p>\n<p>JOHN: We’re right, but it’s wrong there, on that bit.</p>\n<p>GEORGE: You see, the first one’s not bad. [playing halts]</p>\n<p>JOHN: No, the thing that we’ve done is that we found out that’s the weak bit, right.</p>\n<p>PAUL: Yeah.</p>\n<p>JOHN: So we tried putting voices on it. But it’s still down to the rhythm, somehow. The ba— Love for the first time… [starts playing]</p>\n<p>PAUL: But it was always weak on your guitar.</p>\n<p>JOHN: [agreeing] Yeah, sure.</p>\n<p>PAUL: That’s the weak bit of the song, that.</p>\n<h3 id=\"notes-1\">Notes</h3>\n<p>Shorter exchange that crystallizes the structural problem with the chorus and John’s view of it as a “weak bit” in need of rhythmic, not just vocal, adjustment.

Paul is acutely aware that he sounds like a director; George insists you only find what works by playing. John acts as mediator and offers practical suggestions (vamping, structure), while Paul openly worries about filming and time pressure.</p>\n<h3 id=\"dialogue-2\">Dialogue</h3>\n<p>PAUL: You see, we’re really – we’re gonna have to sorta bring it together, because we’re all at odds, we’re doing that thing we did on The Beatles, we’re all playing, you know, like… [incoherent] Like in this verse, it’s two harmonies singing, trying to say some words, right. So like you know, you can just, duh duh dun… ch cha. And in the bits, when we need bits, we’re not—</p>\n<p>JOHN: Yeah I know the bits. I’m just trying to sing it, and do it through.</p>\n<p>PAUL: [plays] You know what I mean? We’ve got to get riffs, when the riff bits come up.</p>\n<p>GEORGE: The riffs. Uh, there’s no riffs. I mean, it’s nice to get – just to get what you’re playing—</p>\n<p>PAUL: No, but it’s just, look – you see, “you and I”, uh – on—</p>\n<p>GEORGE: You and I, our memories…</p>\n<p>PAUL: Uh, but it’s not – it’s not together, you see, so it’s not sounding together. Even on—</p>\n<p>GEORGE: So we can only play until we – until we can find the bit—</p>\n<p>PAUL: Or we can stop and say it’s not together.</p>\n<p>GEORGE: Yes, then you’ve got to carry on until we get it together. So I mean, that’s all, that’s all I can do is play—</p>\n<p>PAUL: Okay. Well, I, you know—</p>\n<p>GEORGE: —until it sounds as though it’s blending with the rest—</p>\n<p>PAUL: I never know what to say to that, you know, ’cause what I want to say is now come on, and play… you know.</p>\n<p>GEORGE: Yes, I know.</p>\n<p>PAUL: But I can’t, you know, because we get into that line.</p>\n<p>GEORGE: It does.</p>\n<p>PAUL: Okay. [laughs nervously] So, here we go. [starts playing] You know, I mean, well. Tell us something about that. I can’t make it eyond that. It’s like, it’s – it’s complicated now. So. See, if we can get simpler, and then complicate it where it needs complications, but it’s complicated in the bit—</p>\n<p>GEORGE: It’s not complicated. I’m just gonna—</p>\n<p>PAUL: I know, but I mean – you know.</p>\n<p>GEORGE: I mean, I’ll play just the chords, if you’ll like, and—</p>\n<p>PAUL: [hushed] No, come on, you always get like—</p>\n<p>GEORGE: —and then – but that’s all I’m trying to do—</p>\n<p>PAUL: [anxious] You always get annoyed when I say that. I’m – I’m trying to help, you know, but I always hear myself annoying you, and I’m trying to—</p>\n<p>GEORGE: No, you’re not annoying me.</p>\n<p>PAUL: —I get so I can’t say—</p>\n<p>GEORGE: [acquiescent] You don’t annoy me [anymore?].</p>\n<p>PAUL: But you know what I mean. You know, well, do this, then. [plays] And then… I don’t know. [long pause] Yeah. I can’t do it on film, either. [laughs; bleak] I don’t know if I can do it on camera. [long silence; guitar playing]</p>\n<p>JOHN: Do you want me to keep this up? [plays riff] ’Cause I’m trying to find something that’s nice to sing to—</p>\n<p>PAUL: Yeah, you see, I don’t mind—</p>\n<p>JOHN: Yeah, and—</p>\n<p>PAUL: —but doesn’t everyone agree that it’s confused at the moment?</p>\n<p>JOHN: Yeah.</p>\n<p>PAUL: So all I’m trying to say is – is like, let’s get the confusion unconfusing, and then confuse it. You know, like, we’re just – this is what we’ve been doing all afternoon. This is why we’re not getting anything done. You know, we’re just rolling on with it. We’ve only got twelve more days. So you know, we’ve really got to do this methodically, this one. Like unconfused, then a bit more confused, then a bit more, now try this drumming here, try this drumming there, now okay, let’s stop and go look into this bit—</p>\n<p>JOHN: Well, I’ve got an idea. I should vamp, ’cause I’ve got to sing, and it’s hard going— [plays rhythm]</p>\n<p>PAUL: Doing that?</p>\n<p>JOHN: But it’s annoying, you know. And let me do it— [plays rhythm]</p>\n<p>PAUL: Okay, can you do that—</p>\n<p>JOHN: I’ll do just that kind of vamping. [plays rhythm]</p>\n<p>PAUL: Yeah. [laughs] Drag it halfway through candid camera. [long pause; listening to John playing] Yeah.</p>\n<p>JOHN: [reassuring] Forget about candid camera.</p>\n<p>PAUL: [wan] Can’t, though. [quietly; to George] But you see we’ve been saying— [inaudible] —a lot of, uh— [inaudible] —that I can do about. You know, it’s like I’ve always found that – but I always feel it, though, like you think I’m trying to put you down, or stop you from playing, but I’m not. I’m trying to stop us all playing, until we know what we’re playing.</p>\n<p>GEORGE: Yeah, but you’ve got to play it in order to find which fits and which doesn’t.</p>\n<p>PAUL: Mm.</p>\n<p>GEORGE: You see, that’s all you can do in this—</p>\n<p>PAUL: But it’s like – I know, but I’m thinking of this other thing which is where we’re playing the solos. We’re improvising the solos, but we’ll play strict chords and strict rhythms.</p>\n<p>GEORGE: Yeah.</p>\n<p>PAUL: Without the vocals.</p>\n<p>GEORGE: [inaudible; drowned out by playing]</p>\n<p>PAUL: You know, but I don’t want to say it, because I really just hear myself as being the only one saying it. Always. And I just basically sort of sit there, like— [inaudible; drowned out by playing] —and I never get any support or anything. So I just think, “Oh well. [inaudible]” You know. It’s right. [to John] And you know it’s right.</p>\n<p>JOHN: [consenting] Yes, alright, but I just don’t know what to do about it.</p>\n<p>PAUL: Well, you know.</p>\n<p>JOHN: You know, I mean, up ’til then—</p>\n<p>GEORGE: I mean, I’ll wait until you figure out your bits and then work my part out, if you like.</p>\n<p>PAUL: No no no—</p>\n<p>GEORGE: It’s like that, it’s like a matter of working it out with you while you’re working your bit out. You know, if you’ve got your bass bit. [plays] You know, I mean, so. It just would—</p>\n<p>PAUL: I know, I know, but I’m—</p>\n<p>GEORGE: Because it’ll take even longer in a way, if there—</p>\n<p>PAUL: Look, I’m not trying to say that, and I’m not trying to say that about you. You know, you’re doing this again as though I’m trying to say that, and what we said the other day, you know – I’m not trying to get [at] you. But what I really am trying to just say is, “Look, lads.” The band, you know. “Should we try it like this?” You know.</p>\n<p>GEORGE: It’s funny now how it only occurs when you put the – on—</p>\n<p>PAUL: I know, if this one is like, “Should we play guitar all through ‘Hey Jude’?” Well, I don’t think we should, but—</p>\n<p>GEORGE: Well, okay, I don’t mind, I’ll play, you know, whatever you want me to play. Or I won’t play at all, if you don’t want me to play. Now, whatever it is that will please you, I’ll do it. [pause] But I don’t think you really know what that one is. [long pause; playing]</p>\n<p>JOHN: [hedging] But do you want to take the [inaudible]?</p>\n<p>GEORGE: [singing quietly] Going nowhere…</p>\n<p>PAUL: [exasperated] No, okay, but don’t – come on. Look, you know—</p>\n<p>JOHN: The galloping bit. And I’ll just vamp.</p>\n<p>PAUL: Look, you know, the… [sighs] No, it’s not like that. You see, that’s it, it’s like, we can’t do this. We’ve really got to sort out this, ’cause we’re – this is  – we’re like – this is the one, you know. Now we’re rehearsing, and we’re trying to like get it together for a TV show, so we really – like you said, we’ve only been through four numbers, you know.</p>\n<p>GEORGE: Mm.</p>\n<p>JOHN: Well…</p>\n<p>PAUL: So we’ve probably got to get some system to get through like twenty, or thirty, and no more, and have learnt them. And it’s probably going to be like sculpture. So that we get all the chords. So we can all vamp and all. Then we can all play, like, every solo we need. But like… You know what I mean? It’s got to sound as though it’s improving.</p>\n<p>GEORGE: [careful] Yeah, well, it actually – it sounded to me, that for me, it was a waste of me time playing, when we started it today. I mean, I just started remembering then what it could get into the other day, after playing for around an hour, an hour and a half. And suddenly, you know, I just don’t find that my – that what I’m doing is starting to have something, you know. Have some structure to it. [pause] You know, that’s the thing.</p>\n<p>PAUL: Yeah, I know, I know what you mean, you know. ’Cause it’s like—</p>\n<p>GEORGE: You know, I mean—</p>\n<p>PAUL: It’s just that that way of doing it, you know, puts me off the way I’m trying to do it, and—</p>\n<p>GEORGE: [resigned] Well, that’s – you know. That’s all, then. I can only do me, in that one way, however I do it, you know. [long pause]</p>\n<p>PAUL: [resigned] Let’s do another song.</p>\n<p>GEORGE: [commiserating] No, come on, we just have to learn this—</p>\n<p>PAUL: No, no, it’s – let’s just do something else.</p>\n<p>GEORGE: Do you want to do… ‘Maxwell Silver Hammer’?</p>\n<p>JOHN: [encouraging] Well, let’s do this, ’cause then we – we’re gonna come to this, or whatever it is. And the thing is just try and think what – the stage we’ve got to be in then.</p>\n<p>PAUL: You just have to know that. I think we’ve wasted a lot of time, I think. I think we do like waste, physically waste a heck of a lot of time, you know, when the four of us are together.</p>\n<h3 id=\"notes-2\">Notes</h3>\n<p>Defines the core “process” disagreement between Paul and George: stop and fix vs. play until it gels. Shows Paul’s anxiety about being the only one saying “this is confused,” his awareness of annoying George, and John’s role as mediator.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"4\">4</h2>\n<h3 id=\"overview-3\">Overview</h3>\n<p>Later in the day, Paul, John, and George discuss leadership, songs as “your scene”, and the difficulty of being “the boss”. Paul acknowledges he has been effectively leading for a couple of years and is now scared of that role; George insists that Paul doesn’t “boss out” on them and that the group’s slowness is partly due to lack of clear direction.</p>\n<h3 id=\"dialogue-3\">Dialogue</h3>\n<p>GEORGE: But that’s like, I’ve learnt that bit, and I’m trying to – I’m trying to take that – those chords along with it…</p>\n<p>PAUL: [inaudible; drowned out by George’s voice] I’m not trying to – I only want to ask you. You know.</p>\n<p>JOHN: I think, it’s your song. And you’ve gotta— [inaudible] —gotta have it exactly how he wants to do it, you know. If you say, “Don’t play that, play that,” it’s up to you, you know. You sort of take it. ’Cause it’s your scene. If somebody’s gonna ask for [inaudible], it’s his song.</p>\n<p>PAUL: But now I – now I’m scared of that. To be the boss. And I – and I have been, for like, uh, a couple of years. And we all have, you know. There’s no pretending about that.</p>\n<p>JOHN: Yeah I know, but – but this—</p>\n<p>PAUL: And no one is [the boss]. That is what we decided, you know. And no one is—</p>\n<p>JOHN: But it’s all in—</p>\n<p>PAUL: And no one’s – you know how rush— [audio cuts off] —and this is why, you know, it’s chaos—</p>\n<p>GEORGE: You don’t boss out on us. It’s fine.</p>\n<p>PAUL: Until it sort of… That’s why we take so long! Because, really, you know, and we get sort of – so that’s the thing. We can play it shitty and all. I – I think we can play it shitty like ten times, so it’s sort of in there, and then I think we can kind of play it quite good, then. But it’s only – I don’t know, it’s just like different approaches, you know. I think we’d be better just learn, just doing it all, like uh, you know, the Red Norvo Five. Just really, like, uh—</p>\n<p>GEORGE: Vamping away.</p>\n<p>PAUL: Vamping, sort of efficient vamping, really, you know, and then get the imaginative thing. You know. [pauses] But anyway, I know it’s impossible for us to go like – because we can’t get into the moment, ’cause you don’t do it like that, and— [plays riff]</p>\n<p>GEORGE: I know, and I’m trying, but— [plays]</p>\n<p>PAUL: No no no I mean, just, generally… [John sings ‘Two Of Us’ under his breath] It’s like when you’ve been trying to get me to do it and I do it. And that’s how I do it, but that’s not how you do it. [everyone plays]</p>\n<p>JOHN: [laughs; stops playing] See, I suppose that’s how they do it.</p>\n<h3 id=\"notes-3\">Notes</h3>\n<p>Important self-awareness moment for Paul about his reluctant leadership and fear of being “the boss”. John explicitly affirms the songwriter’s right to direct their own song; George tries to reassure Paul he doesn’t feel bossed.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"5\">5</h2>\n<h3 id=\"overview-4\">Overview</h3>\n<p>Paul proposes a structural solution to conflicting working methods: each Beatle should have undivided creative direction over their own compositions, with improvisation agreed upon explicitly. George likes the idea; John prefers improvisation. Paul muses that their discord is “far further reaching” than just music.</p>\n<h3 id=\"dialogue-4\">Dialogue</h3>\n<p>PAUL: [inaudible; drowned out by guitar] —of seeing yourself nearly go round a past you’ve been down too many times, you know I go down it, you know, like us going on about this. I really don’t want to go back to that. And it’s just silly. And I just can’t think of any solution out of here. The problem is that we should all arrange our own tunes, and if you want improvisation, then we should just say, you know, right, and—</p>\n<p>GEORGE: That’s the best way.</p>\n<p>PAUL: —and we improvise here. But look, it puts on much more work on each one of us, then, because then you’ve got to work out my bassline.</p>\n<p>JOHN: I’d say improvise it, like.</p>\n<p>PAUL: Yeah. [laughs bleakly] It’s like a bunch of theories, isn’t it? It’s like, it’s not just to do with playing music, this. It’s far further reaching, this sort of – this thing, you know.</p>\n<p>GEORGE: It’s always the far reaching end of it. It stems from the mad thing they call— [audio cuts off]</p>\n<h3 id=\"notes-4\">Notes</h3>\n<p>Sets up the idea (that will later partly come true) of each member having their own “domain” on their songs. Also shows Paul’s sense that their disagreements are metaphysical, not just technical.</p>",{headings:4085,localImagePaths:4106,remoteImagePaths:4107,frontmatter:4108,imagePaths:4111},[4086,4087,4088,4089,4090,4091,4092,4093,4094,4095,4096,4097,4098,4099,4100,4101,4102,4103,4104,4105],{depth:89,slug:3605,text:3605},{depth:64,slug:1581,text:1582},{depth:64,slug:1799,text:3608},{depth:64,slug:3570,text:3571},{depth:89,slug:3611,text:3611},{depth:64,slug:3613,text:1582},{depth:64,slug:3615,text:3608},{depth:64,slug:3617,text:3571},{depth:89,slug:3619,text:3619},{depth:64,slug:3621,text:1582},{depth:64,slug:3623,text:3608},{depth:64,slug:3625,text:3571},{depth:89,slug:3664,text:3664},{depth:64,slug:3666,text:1582},{depth:64,slug:3668,text:3608},{depth:64,slug:3670,text:3571},{depth:89,slug:3672,text:3672},{depth:64,slug:3674,text:1582},{depth:64,slug:3676,text:3608},{depth:64,slug:3678,text:3571},[],[],{title:4073,category:1789,date_range:4074,source:1791,reliability:1792,relevance:1793,tags:4109,created:4110},[1431,1795,1796,1797,1798,1799,4076,3586,3587,3589,3588,3590,4077,4042,3722],["Date","2025-12-19T00:00:00.000Z"],[],"get-back-dialogue-day-to-day/day-2-get-back.md","get-back-dialogue-day-to-day/day-3-get-back",{id:4113,data:4115,body:4121,filePath:4122,digest:4123,rendered:4124,legacyId:4158},{title:4116,category:1789,date_range:4117,source:1791,reliability:1792,relevance:1793,tags:4118,created:4120},"Get Back / Let It Be Sessions: Day 3 transcripts and notes","January 7, 1969",[1431,1795,1796,1797,1798,1799,4119,3586,3587,3589,3588,3590,4042],"1/7/1969",["Date","2025-12-19T00:00:00.000Z"],"## 1\r\n\r\n### Overview\r\n\r\nJanuary 7th, 1969: In the morning, Paul sings ‘Golden Slumbers’ and ‘Carry That Weight’ by himself while waiting for the other Beatles to arrive in the studio.\r\n\r\n### Dialogue\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### Notes\r\n\r\nSolo piano work; no verbatim dialogue given in the master notes, but it establishes Paul’s early-morning composing/woodshedding mood.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 2\r\n\r\n### Overview\r\n\r\nAs Michael Lindsay-Hogg pushes for a concrete plan for the concert/TV special, Paul tries to stir enthusiasm; George openly rejects the idea of returning to early Beatlemania–style performance. The discussion circles around whether they still want to “do it” live at all, and what “doing it” even means now that they’ve grown up.\r\n\r\n### Dialogue\r\n\r\nPAUL: But we had a lot more incentive, then.\r\n\r\nGEORGE: Ah, but I was so much older then… I’m younger than that now… \r\n\r\nPAUL: But we really don’t need— You know, those films of us [back then]– that was us doing it, you know. \r\n\r\nGEORGE: [chagrined] Well, if that’s what doing it is, that’s why I don’t want to do it.\r\n\r\nPAUL: Yeah. Yeah, I think—\r\n\r\nGEORGE: Because I never liked that. It was always a drag. \r\n\r\nPAUL: [upset] Yeah, but – right. You know. You know, uh— [faltering] You see, that – that takes the thing, and – and twists it a bit.\r\n\r\nGEORGE: Well, it does, because I never liked that. That’s why I—\r\n\r\nPAUL: Well, you see, nowadays, you’ve grown up. And you don’t have to do that anymore. \r\n\r\nGEORGE: Yeah. \r\n\r\nPAUL: You see, that’s it. You don’t have to do – put the pancake [makeup] up, and go out in front and sweat, and shake our heads, because we’re not that anymore. We’ve grown up a bit. \r\n\r\nGEORGE: Because we’ve done that anyway.\r\n\r\nPAUL: Yeah, right. So what I mean is, we did it then, but it doesn’t mean, like, to do it again, we have to do all that.\r\n\r\nMICHAEL: Right.\r\n\r\nPAUL: Because now, like – for him to do it, is do it in a black bag with Yoko, you know. [to John] And – and you’re doing it. [pause] I suppose. \r\n\r\nGEORGE: White bag. \r\n\r\nMICHAEL: A white bag.\r\n\r\nPAUL: White bag. [pause; to John] But that’s it, you’re doing it, then, on this level, you know. But – you know. I mean, I—\r\n\r\nMICHAEL: But do you see it as – do you still want to perform for an audience, or do you just see yourselves sort of as recording people?\r\n\r\nPAUL: I think—\r\n\r\nMICHAEL: You see, but I think John’s right. It’s communication. And I think part of communication is seeing you doing it. \r\n\r\nPAUL: I think there’s something to do with an audience, there, yeah. I think – [pause] I think we’ve got a bit shy, you know. I think I’ve got a bit shy of – certain things, you know. And it’s like, uh – it is like that. It’s like, um—\r\n\r\nMICHAEL: I guess maybe the difficulty is also getting up in front of an audience, if – all you’ve done in front of an audience is trying to get something as good, but maybe not the same thing. You know, and it’s a very hard thing to get back. In other words, you musn’t think of getting back what you had. Because you don’t want—\r\n\r\nPAUL: No, that’s what Yoko was saying the other day, you know. We don’t – we musn’t try and get in the audience, and get them wild, and get—\r\n\r\nMICHAEL: Although they may be. [inaudible] Because they’ve grown up as well. I mean, everyone in this room has grown up. \r\n\r\nPAUL: Yeah. \r\n\r\nMICHAEL: You know what I mean?\r\n\r\nPAUL: Sure, yeah. That’s – that’s what’s great about it, you know. That’s why I don’t think we need to sort of play down, or do anything – we’ve really got to do what we do, but like, with the same kind of… No, it’s not even – it’s not even discipline, it’s the same kind of—\r\n\r\nMICHAEL: Drive. \r\n\r\nPAUL: Dr– desire to do it.\r\n\r\nMICHAEL: Desire. To do it.\r\n\r\nPAUL: You know, it’s like – it’s like all these songs, you know. There are some really great songs, and I just hope we don’t blow any of them. [to John] Because you know how often like on albums we sometimes blow one of your songs, because we come in in the wrong mood, and uh, you say, “This is how it goes, I’ll be back.” And we’re all just, [flustered voice] “Oh, uh, you—” Chuga chuga chuga chuga...\r\n\r\nMICHAEL: That’s why we’re wrong to throw away the show. Because there’s no desire –  I mean like, sure, I think I, M. L. H., can do a show with you better than anybody in the world, because I’ve got to be the best rock'n'roll director in the world, he says without any false humility. But equally, at the moment, we haven’t got a show, and so none of us are gonna want to do it. \r\n\r\nPAUL: Yeah, I know what you—\r\n\r\nMICHAEL: And the trouble is, that is why George was saying – he’s saying, “None of us want to do a show, because it ain’t a show.” And it’s like—\r\n\r\nPAUL: Yeah. \r\n\r\nMICHAEL: —we’ve got to find something else to go out and do it.\r\n\r\nGEORGE: And it’s that thing about – of the songs, too, you know. ‘Cause really, I don’t want to do any of my songs on the show, because I know they’ll always just turn out shitty, like—\r\n\r\nPAUL: No, but you see – no, see, this is where I think, though—\r\n\r\nGEORGE: Because, uh, they come out like a compromise, whereas in a studio they can—\r\n\r\nPAUL: [anxious] But you see – look, George—\r\n\r\nGEORGE: —work on ‘em, ‘til you want ‘em… and get it out of your mind.\r\n\r\nPAUL: Last year, you were telling me, that, “You can do anything you want, Paul.”\r\n\r\nGEORGE: Yeah.\r\n\r\nPAUL: “Anything you desire, you can do,” you know.\r\n\r\nGEORGE: Yeah.\r\n\r\nPAUL: Now, but these days—\r\n\r\nGEORGE: But you have to desire it.\r\n\r\nPAUL: [trying] But you’re saying – before this show is finished, before we’ve done it— Now, like the arrow, letting forth, is letting forth on this word of, “We’re not going to be able to do it, we’re going to come out a compromise.” Now, I don’t think that! I really don’t. I think you – we’ve done it, you know. I think we’ve – I really think we’re very good. And we can get it together, if we think that we want to do these songs great, we can just do it great, you know. But I think thinking it’s not going to come out great won’t help.\r\n\r\nGEORGE: Yeah.\r\n\r\nPAUL: You know, that’s like – that is like meditation, where you just – you get into a bummer, and you come out of it. You don’t go through it, you know. \r\n\r\nRINGO: Yeah.\r\n\r\nPAUL: I think we can, like, help, if we – you know, on anything like that. [to Ringo] If – so, okay, if you’re sick of playing the drums, we’ve all gotta say, “Look, we’re sick too, you know, pat pat, look, you know, it’s all the same,” and… we go through it with you. It’s no use just saying, “Well, fuck off, then.” “Oh, fuck that.” You know? What’s good, that?\r\n\r\n### Notes\r\n\r\nKey articulation of George’s aversion to old-style touring and of Paul’s “we’ve grown up” frame. Paul leans on motivation and mindset (“desire,” meditation) while George focuses on compromise and dissatisfaction with live compromises.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 3\r\n\r\n### Overview\r\n\r\nThe discussion shifts to show format (concert vs. documentary) and the band’s lack of enthusiasm. Paul confesses he’d perform “anywhere, anyhow” just to keep things going, and tries, with little success, to get John to discuss his real feelings.\r\n\r\n### Dialogue\r\n\r\nGEORGE: It would be nice – you see, uh, if we’re just singing these songs – for me to watch it, I’d be bored if it was, “Oh, haha, thank you, now we’d like to do…” and all that. Or if it was like just edited from – you know, clap clap, bam, and you know, like that, like they do those films, that would be better. \r\n\r\nPAUL: See, there is that possibility too, which is the one I originally thought this was going to be, actually. Which was not to have a documentary, but to have the show – have documentary and show, just intercut. But it’s not as good as – it’s half arsed. It’s two ideas in one, because neither of ‘em is good enough. \r\n\r\nMICHAEL: If it comes off – if this comes off, we’ve got great chaps, we’ve got a great entertainment package in an album, a documentary never seen before, and a performance. It’s a great package. \r\n\r\nGEORGE: Yeah, you know, I mean, a lot could come out of it if we could get the enthusiasm and the strength to do it. \r\n\r\nMICHAEL: See, I think that the truest thing is if we – if we get it together.\r\n\r\nPAUL: [upset; to John] I mean, I’ll – I’ll sing in a corner with Mal on the tour, or I’ll sit here, and I’ll – I’ll anything. ’Cause I – I enjoy it all. That’s the only thing I enjoy, actually. [inaudible; drowned out by George’s and Michael’s voices] It’s terrible just to – I mean, imagine if you – if you were the only one interested. And I’m not easing it in, easing it in right now. I know you’re interested in that. But you won’t say anything to me about it.\r\n\r\nJOHN: [long pause] I said what I’d been thinking. I would. And that is what I have. \r\n\r\nPAUL: [tired] Are you still thinking that now? What are you thinking now?\r\n\r\nJOHN: [evasive] I’m still thinking about it. [continues playing]\r\n\r\n### Notes\r\n\r\nPaul’s “I’ll sing in a corner with Mal” line crystallizes his desperation to keep the band active; John’s evasiveness underlines the communication gap Paul keeps circling.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 4\r\n\r\n### Overview\r\n\r\nPaul’s frustration boils over. He describes the entire project as school-like obligation, complains about apathy, and notes that all four Beatles privately ask Neil about “what the lads are doing” instead of talking directly to each other. Michael calls the current mood “the doldrums”; George bluntly says The Beatles have been in them for at least a year. Mal and Michael affirm the band’s importance to the world.\r\n\r\n### Dialogue\r\n\r\nMICHAEL: ’Cause otherwise, there isn’t any point in doing it. I don’t mean – I don’t mean us copping out in any way. I just mean, we oughta make – if we’re gonna do it, we oughta make it… very good. Stop me when – stop me when I’m— [inaudible]\r\n\r\nPAUL: It’s like Mal said last night. “If you’re gonna do the show here, you’ve got to decide today.” And he sort of said it, almost frightened to say it, you know, to the lads. Didn’t really want to sort of shout at us. Didn’t want – but he had to say it, because if you do the show, you’re gonna have to decide today, you know, and it’s like that. And it’s like if you’re gonna do these songs, you’ve got to learn the chords. And we all know them. And we’ve got to learn the words. It’s just certain basic things that we’ve got to do, if we’re gonna do it. See, and as far as I can see there’s only two ways, and that’s what I was shouting about the last meeting we had. There’s only two things, you know. We’re gonna do it, or we’re not gonna do it. And I want a decision. Because I’m – I’m not interested enough to come to spend so many days farting around here while everyone makes up their minds about whether they want to do it or not, you know. I’ll do it. If everyone else will, and everyone wants to do it, then alright. [laughs bleakly] But it’s just a bit – a bit soft, you know? It’s—\r\n\r\nMICHAEL: The point is—\r\n\r\nPAUL: It’s like a school, you know, you’ve got to be here! And I haven’t. I haven’t, you know, I’ve… see, I’ve left school. We’ve all left school, and we don’t have to go. But it gets into a scene where you do have to go there.\r\n\r\nMICHAEL: No, you see the first thing to get together is yourselves, totally. And then we all follow with our kit bags and our campers.\r\n\r\nPAUL: So it’s like if we’re doing the show right now, we’re gonna have to work hard, and we’re gonna have to even think about how many songs that we’ll today have to have rehearsed, in order to by five days before it, to know ’em all. Now, five days before it is a week from now. And that means by the time a week from now comes, all these songs we’ve got, we’ve gotta know perfectly, and then [for] five days we’ll really, really get us to know it. You know, but I mean, there’s no – there’s no use to sort of waiting for the players themselves until we’ve got to put off the date and [inaudible] it to the cameras and say, “Don’t, we can’t have the cameras now.” [pause] It’s not like that, is it? [long pause] See, apathy’s alright, if— [inaudible; drowned out by George’s and George Martin’s voices] \r\n\r\nMICHAEL: [inaudible] —anyway.\r\n\r\nPAUL: That’s alright, it’s allowed. \r\n\r\nMICHAEL: Yeah, sure.\r\n\r\nPAUL: [inaudlble] —if it’s supposed to be opposite then you shouldn’t— [inaudible]\r\n\r\nMICHAEL: So it’s, “Everybody, pull your socks up”?\r\n\r\nPAUL: Sure it is, you know. Yeah I—\r\n\r\nMICHAEL: The first day was the best musical day, for me it was a musical day, yeah. Because you routined about four numbers. [long pause]\r\n\r\nPAUL: But I must say I’ll get, uh, put down, ’cause you know. Like if certain people aren’t interested, then I do… I lose interest. [long pause] And we can’t blame our tours or anything, or so on and so on and so on. [long pause] You see this one, that we’ve been having, this year, makes me really want to—\r\n\r\nGEORGE: Last year. Last year.\r\n\r\nPAUL: —snap out of it. Or snap into it. De-plastic it. But the past couple of months, you know, it’s been this, but the [White] album was like this, you see. The album was worse than this. This just seems sort of—\r\n\r\nMICHAEL: What, agony?\r\n\r\nPAUL: Well, just the whole idea of, do you want to do it? Do we want to do it? And that’s the joke, you see. After it all came about, Neil was saying to me we’d all phoned him individually, saying things like, you know, “Can you get ‘em together?” “Can you get it – oh, can you get it together?” “I want to know, what’re we doing?” You know. But like, instead of asking each other, we’ve all gone to Neil and asked him, “What’re the lads doing?” But you know, we should just have it out.\r\n\r\nGEORGE: But we keep coming up again, that one. And like you were saying, “Yeah well I’d like to do this, this, and that, yeah, and I’d like to do this, and I’d like to do that, and I’d like to do that,” and we end up doing something again that nobody really wants to do. [laughs]\r\n\r\nPAUL: Well then, you know, I think if this one—\r\n\r\nGEORGE: Make it public, at that.\r\n\r\nPAUL: Maybe it should definitely be the last for all of us. Because there just isn’t any point [inaudible]—\r\n\r\nGEORGE: Yeah, that’s it. [long pause]\r\n\r\nMICHAEL: I think I’d be sad. I mean, as an audience member, I’d be sad.\r\n\r\nPAUL: Of course it is! It’s stupid, you know! It is just stupid. But, it’s even more stupid the other way. To go through it. Because – you know.\r\n\r\nMICHAEL: I agree, but it’s—\r\n\r\nGEORGE: ’Cause this time we could be using for what you want to be doing—\r\n\r\nPAUL: You see, the thing is the people who are being stupid are the four of us. There’s nobody else. There’s only the four of us. You can’t actually, you know just sort of blame it on – ’cause there’s no other band, you know!\r\n\r\nGEORGE: —and being creative, instead of being like in the doldrums, which it always is now…\r\n\r\nMICHAEL: I wrote in my book, because I kind of keep a diary about what’s going on so I can cut it, and “doldrums” was the word I used. Because the doldrums have been coming, like – like to a ship on a [inaudible]—\r\n\r\nGEORGE: Oh, The Beatles have been in doldrums for at least a year.\r\n\r\nMICHAEL: You see, that is – that is terrible to say.\r\n\r\nPAUL: [desperate] We – we haven’t played together, you see! That’s the fucking thing. But when we do come together to play together, we all just sort of talk about the fleeting past! We’re like old-age pensioners! “Remember the days when we used to rock?” You know, but we’re here now! We can do it, you know. But I mean, I’m – all I hoping for is enthusiasm from you so—\r\n\r\nMICHAEL: That was – that was the idea—\r\n\r\nMAL: [earnest] I’d just like to say that you are needed, you know. The Beatles are needed. To so many people, you know.\r\n\r\nMICHAEL: Yeah, you’re right.\r\n\r\nMAL: Whatever you do.\r\n\r\nPAUL: You see the thing is also I – I get to a bit where I just sort of push all my ideas and I know that my ideas aren’t the best, you know. They are [mechanical voice] good, good, but they’re not the best, you know. But we can improve on it. Because we write songs together, and we improve on it. You know. [to Ringo] And you can improve on your drumming like it is, if you get into it. If you don’t, you know, okay, then I have better ideas, but if you get into it, you’re better! You know. It’s like that.\r\n\r\nGEORGE: And after all that, it’s like, you know, what do they say? It comes from a – and the eaves springs out of an E—\r\n\r\nMICHAEL: An ear.\r\n\r\nGEORGE: And that’s, you know, all that existentialist crap. [laughs]\r\n\r\nMICHAEL: Just like Jean-Paul, yeah, exactly.\r\n\r\nGEORGE: You know, it’s like…\r\n\r\nMICHAEL: You can call him John-Paul George, as opposed to Jean-Paul Sartre, you know. [laughs] We have a joke over here. You heard that, did you hear? Call him John-Paul George, as opposed to Jean-Paul Sartre, as a weird existentialism. [pause] Um, yeah. Like, it’s communication. And I think – I mean, see corny’s great, and like Mal said, it’s so corny that such a – I mean, he didn’t put it [as] corny, but it’s – you are terribly corny. [pause; scattered laughter] And that is what the world… [George starts singing ‘What The World Needs Now Is Love’] I mean really, ’cause – everyone in the world can say what they think except for you. We all need you. And you know, it’s the tears coming in the eyes of the little boy sitting in London as opposed to the little girl in America. And it’s communication. And it iss communication. And if you all can’t get it together, that’s really very sad. So, I feel what we should do now is let you play a little, and then you’ll have lunch together, and I can give you some more film, maybe. [pause]\r\n\r\nPAUL: Yes.\r\n\r\nMICHAEL: So, should we leave you for a while? I mean, if you—\r\n\r\nPAUL: Yes, yeah.\r\n\r\n### Notes\r\n\r\nCaptures the “doldrums” diagnosis and Paul’s “we haven’t played together” cry. Also underscores Mal and Michael’s view of The Beatles as culturally necessary, and Paul’s awareness that his ideas are not “the best” but need group refinement.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 5\r\n\r\n### Overview\r\n\r\nIn a quieter exchange, George explains why he’s sat on many songs for years, fearing they’d be dismissed in the studio; Paul argues that what matters is noticing problems together and resolving them. George floats, almost casually, the idea of a “divorce”. Paul says he’s already thought it; John breaks the tension with a joke about “the children”.\r\n\r\n### Dialogue\r\n\r\nGEORGE: Well, what I was saying about the songs was like, the reason, you know, like, I’ve got about twenty songs from 1948 was because I knew very well the moment I’d bring them in the studio, that – [blows raspberry] there it’s gone, you know.\r\n\r\nPAUL: Yeah.\r\n\r\nGEORGE: And, uh, so I never did. And, like, slowly now, I can bring a couple out because I can get it more like how it should have been then. And that’s – you know, it’s like, it’s just…\r\n\r\nPAUL: You see, but it doesn’t matter what’s going wrong. It really doesn’t matter what’s going wrong, as long as the four of us notice it.\r\n\r\nGEORGE: [disbelieving; laughs] Well, I’ve noticed it, alright. \r\n\r\nPAUL: No, but and – and – instead of just noticing it, determine to put it right, you know. [pause] ‘Cause that’s what I’m – that’s what I’m onto.\r\n\r\nGEORGE: Maybe we should have a divorce.\r\n\r\nPAUL: Well, I said that last week, you know. But it’s getting nearer.\r\n\r\nJOHN: Who’d have the children?\r\n\r\nPAUL: [pause] Dick James.\r\n\r\nJOHN: Oh, yeah.\r\n\r\n### Notes\r\n\r\nThe “divorce” talk is still half-jokey, but grounded in George’s longstanding sense of being creatively sidelined. Paul tries to reframe it as a problem they can collectively “determine to put right”.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 6\r\n\r\n### Overview\r\n\r\nPaul articulates, almost directly to John, his determination not to let the band “crack up” and his frustration that the four of them never truly “talk it out” together. He accuses John of talking down (or not talking at all), then immediately admits the same critique applies to himself.\r\n\r\n### Dialogue\r\n\r\nPAUL: ’Cause you know, that’s what I was telling you on the phone, that… I’ll do it. Just because it is so silly of us now, at this point in our lives, to crack up. It’s just so silly. Because there’s no point! We’re not going to get anywhere that we wanna get by doing that. The only possible direction is the other way from that, you know. [pause] You know. That is the only possible direction. But the thing is we’re all just theoretically agreeing with it and not doing it. [to John] You’re doing your bit through you and Yoko, you know, but it’s silly, you know, to sort of, uh, coming and talking down to us. Well, actually your way out is not to talk, rather than talk down to us, which you’d have to do, you’d think, but you wouldn’t be. And remember, I think I’m talking down to you, too. [pause] But, you know, we’re not! [laughs bleakly] You know me. We’re all – we’re all alike, here, us four. But we just don’t sort of get to talk it out with each other.  \r\n\r\n### Notes\r\n\r\nA concise statement of the core communication problem: theoretical agreement without action, silence standing in for difficult conversation, and Paul’s recognition that the pattern includes his own behaviour.","src/content/research/get-back-dialogue-day-to-day/day-3-get-back.md","038037c94a8e40ff",{html:4125,metadata:4126},"<h2 id=\"1\">1</h2>\n<h3 id=\"overview\">Overview</h3>\n<p>January 7th, 1969: In the morning, Paul sings ‘Golden Slumbers’ and ‘Carry That Weight’ by himself while waiting for the other Beatles to arrive in the studio.</p>\n<h3 id=\"dialogue\">Dialogue</h3>\n<p>N/A</p>\n<h3 id=\"notes\">Notes</h3>\n<p>Solo piano work; no verbatim dialogue given in the master notes, but it establishes Paul’s early-morning composing/woodshedding mood.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"2\">2</h2>\n<h3 id=\"overview-1\">Overview</h3>\n<p>As Michael Lindsay-Hogg pushes for a concrete plan for the concert/TV special, Paul tries to stir enthusiasm; George openly rejects the idea of returning to early Beatlemania–style performance.

Yeah, I think—</p>\n<p>GEORGE: Because I never liked that. It was always a drag.</p>\n<p>PAUL: [upset] Yeah, but – right. You know. You know, uh— [faltering] You see, that – that takes the thing, and – and twists it a bit.</p>\n<p>GEORGE: Well, it does, because I never liked that. That’s why I—</p>\n<p>PAUL: Well, you see, nowadays, you’ve grown up. And you don’t have to do that anymore.</p>\n<p>GEORGE: Yeah.</p>\n<p>PAUL: You see, that’s it. You don’t have to do – put the pancake [makeup] up, and go out in front and sweat, and shake our heads, because we’re not that anymore. We’ve grown up a bit.</p>\n<p>GEORGE: Because we’ve done that anyway.</p>\n<p>PAUL: Yeah, right. So what I mean is, we did it then, but it doesn’t mean, like, to do it again, we have to do all that.</p>\n<p>MICHAEL: Right.</p>\n<p>PAUL: Because now, like – for him to do it, is do it in a black bag with Yoko, you know. [to John] And – and you’re doing it. [pause] I suppose.</p>\n<p>GEORGE: White bag.</p>\n<p>MICHAEL: A white bag.</p>\n<p>PAUL: White bag. [pause; to John] But that’s it, you’re doing it, then, on this level, you know. But – you know. I mean, I—</p>\n<p>MICHAEL: But do you see it as – do you still want to perform for an audience, or do you just see yourselves sort of as recording people?</p>\n<p>PAUL: I think—</p>\n<p>MICHAEL: You see, but I think John’s right. It’s communication. And I think part of communication is seeing you doing it.</p>\n<p>PAUL: I think there’s something to do with an audience, there, yeah. I think – [pause] I think we’ve got a bit shy, you know. I think I’ve got a bit shy of – certain things, you know. And it’s like, uh – it is like that. It’s like, um—</p>\n<p>MICHAEL: I guess maybe the difficulty is also getting up in front of an audience, if – all you’ve done in front of an audience is trying to get something as good, but maybe not the same thing. You know, and it’s a very hard thing to get back. In other words, you musn’t think of getting back what you had. Because you don’t want—</p>\n<p>PAUL: No, that’s what Yoko was saying the other day, you know. We don’t – we musn’t try and get in the audience, and get them wild, and get—</p>\n<p>MICHAEL: Although they may be. [inaudible] Because they’ve grown up as well. I mean, everyone in this room has grown up.</p>\n<p>PAUL: Yeah.</p>\n<p>MICHAEL: You know what I mean?</p>\n<p>PAUL: Sure, yeah. That’s – that’s what’s great about it, you know. That’s why I don’t think we need to sort of play down, or do anything – we’ve really got to do what we do, but like, with the same kind of… No, it’s not even – it’s not even discipline, it’s the same kind of—</p>\n<p>MICHAEL: Drive.</p>\n<p>PAUL: Dr– desire to do it.</p>\n<p>MICHAEL: Desire. To do it.</p>\n<p>PAUL: You know, it’s like – it’s like all these songs, you know. There are some really great songs, and I just hope we don’t blow any of them. [to John] Because you know how often like on albums we sometimes blow one of your songs, because we come in in the wrong mood, and uh, you say, “This is how it goes, I’ll be back.” And we’re all just, [flustered voice] “Oh, uh, you—” Chuga chuga chuga chuga…</p>\n<p>MICHAEL: That’s why we’re wrong to throw away the show. Because there’s no desire –  I mean like, sure, I think I, M. L. H., can do a show with you better than anybody in the world, because I’ve got to be the best rock’n’roll director in the world, he says without any false humility. But equally, at the moment, we haven’t got a show, and so none of us are gonna want to do it.</p>\n<p>PAUL: Yeah, I know what you—</p>\n<p>MICHAEL: And the trouble is, that is why George was saying – he’s saying, “None of us want to do a show, because it ain’t a show.” And it’s like—</p>\n<p>PAUL: Yeah.</p>\n<p>MICHAEL: —we’ve got to find something else to go out and do it.</p>\n<p>GEORGE: And it’s that thing about – of the songs, too, you know. ‘Cause really, I don’t want to do any of my songs on the show, because I know they’ll always just turn out shitty, like—</p>\n<p>PAUL: No, but you see – no, see, this is where I think, though—</p>\n<p>GEORGE: Because, uh, they come out like a compromise, whereas in a studio they can—</p>\n<p>PAUL: [anxious] But you see – look, George—</p>\n<p>GEORGE: —work on ‘em, ‘til you want ‘em… and get it out of your mind.</p>\n<p>PAUL: Last year, you were telling me, that, “You can do anything you want, Paul.”</p>\n<p>GEORGE: Yeah.</p>\n<p>PAUL: “Anything you desire, you can do,” you know.</p>\n<p>GEORGE: Yeah.</p>\n<p>PAUL: Now, but these days—</p>\n<p>GEORGE: But you have to desire it.</p>\n<p>PAUL: [trying] But you’re saying – before this show is finished, before we’ve done it— Now, like the arrow, letting forth, is letting forth on this word of, “We’re not going to be able to do it, we’re going to come out a compromise.” Now, I don’t think that! I really don’t. I think you – we’ve done it, you know. I think we’ve – I really think we’re very good. And we can get it together, if we think that we want to do these songs great, we can just do it great, you know. But I think thinking it’s not going to come out great won’t help.</p>\n<p>GEORGE: Yeah.</p>\n<p>PAUL: You know, that’s like – that is like meditation, where you just – you get into a bummer, and you come out of it. You don’t go through it, you know.</p>\n<p>RINGO: Yeah.</p>\n<p>PAUL: I think we can, like, help, if we – you know, on anything like that. [to Ringo] If – so, okay, if you’re sick of playing the drums, we’ve all gotta say, “Look, we’re sick too, you know, pat pat, look, you know, it’s all the same,” and… we go through it with you. It’s no use just saying, “Well, fuck off, then.” “Oh, fuck that.” You know? What’s good, that?</p>\n<h3 id=\"notes-1\">Notes</h3>\n<p>Key articulation of George’s aversion to old-style touring and of Paul’s “we’ve grown up” frame. Paul leans on motivation and mindset (“desire,” meditation) while George focuses on compromise and dissatisfaction with live compromises.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"3\">3</h2>\n<h3 id=\"overview-2\">Overview</h3>\n<p>The discussion shifts to show format (concert vs. documentary) and the band’s lack of enthusiasm. Paul confesses he’d perform “anywhere, anyhow” just to keep things going, and tries, with little success, to get John to discuss his real feelings.</p>\n<h3 id=\"dialogue-2\">Dialogue</h3>\n<p>GEORGE: It would be nice – you see, uh, if we’re just singing these songs – for me to watch it, I’d be bored if it was, “Oh, haha, thank you, now we’d like to do…” and all that. Or if it was like just edited from – you know, clap clap, bam, and you know, like that, like they do those films, that would be better.</p>\n<p>PAUL: See, there is that possibility too, which is the one I originally thought this was going to be, actually. Which was not to have a documentary, but to have the show – have documentary and show, just intercut. But it’s not as good as – it’s half arsed. It’s two ideas in one, because neither of ‘em is good enough.</p>\n<p>MICHAEL: If it comes off – if this comes off, we’ve got great chaps, we’ve got a great entertainment package in an album, a documentary never seen before, and a performance. It’s a great package.</p>\n<p>GEORGE: Yeah, you know, I mean, a lot could come out of it if we could get the enthusiasm and the strength to do it.</p>\n<p>MICHAEL: See, I think that the truest thing is if we – if we get it together.</p>\n<p>PAUL: [upset; to John] I mean, I’ll – I’ll sing in a corner with Mal on the tour, or I’ll sit here, and I’ll – I’ll anything. ’Cause I – I enjoy it all. That’s the only thing I enjoy, actually. [inaudible; drowned out by George’s and Michael’s voices] It’s terrible just to – I mean, imagine if you – if you were the only one interested. And I’m not easing it in, easing it in right now. I know you’re interested in that. But you won’t say anything to me about it.</p>\n<p>JOHN: [long pause] I said what I’d been thinking. I would. And that is what I have.</p>\n<p>PAUL: [tired] Are you still thinking that now? What are you thinking now?</p>\n<p>JOHN: [evasive] I’m still thinking about it. [continues playing]</p>\n<h3 id=\"notes-2\">Notes</h3>\n<p>Paul’s “I’ll sing in a corner with Mal” line crystallizes his desperation to keep the band active; John’s evasiveness underlines the communication gap Paul keeps circling.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"4\">4</h2>\n<h3 id=\"overview-3\">Overview</h3>\n<p>Paul’s frustration boils over. He describes the entire project as school-like obligation, complains about apathy, and notes that all four Beatles privately ask Neil about “what the lads are doing” instead of talking directly to each other. Michael calls the current mood “the doldrums”; George bluntly says The Beatles have been in them for at least a year. Mal and Michael affirm the band’s importance to the world.</p>\n<h3 id=\"dialogue-3\">Dialogue</h3>\n<p>MICHAEL: ’Cause otherwise, there isn’t any point in doing it. I don’t mean – I don’t mean us copping out in any way. I just mean, we oughta make – if we’re gonna do it, we oughta make it… very good. Stop me when – stop me when I’m— [inaudible]</p>\n<p>PAUL: It’s like Mal said last night. “If you’re gonna do the show here, you’ve got to decide today.” And he sort of said it, almost frightened to say it, you know, to the lads. Didn’t really want to sort of shout at us. Didn’t want – but he had to say it, because if you do the show, you’re gonna have to decide today, you know, and it’s like that. And it’s like if you’re gonna do these songs, you’ve got to learn the chords. And we all know them. And we’ve got to learn the words. It’s just certain basic things that we’ve got to do, if we’re gonna do it. See, and as far as I can see there’s only two ways, and that’s what I was shouting about the last meeting we had. There’s only two things, you know. We’re gonna do it, or we’re not gonna do it. And I want a decision. Because I’m – I’m not interested enough to come to spend so many days farting around here while everyone makes up their minds about whether they want to do it or not, you know. I’ll do it. If everyone else will, and everyone wants to do it, then alright. [laughs bleakly] But it’s just a bit – a bit soft, you know? It’s—</p>\n<p>MICHAEL: The point is—</p>\n<p>PAUL: It’s like a school, you know, you’ve got to be here! And I haven’t. I haven’t, you know, I’ve… see, I’ve left school. We’ve all left school, and we don’t have to go. But it gets into a scene where you do have to go there.</p>\n<p>MICHAEL: No, you see the first thing to get together is yourselves, totally. And then we all follow with our kit bags and our campers.</p>\n<p>PAUL: So it’s like if we’re doing the show right now, we’re gonna have to work hard, and we’re gonna have to even think about how many songs that we’ll today have to have rehearsed, in order to by five days before it, to know ’em all. Now, five days before it is a week from now. And that means by the time a week from now comes, all these songs we’ve got, we’ve gotta know perfectly, and then [for] five days we’ll really, really get us to know it. You know, but I mean, there’s no – there’s no use to sort of waiting for the players themselves until we’ve got to put off the date and [inaudible] it to the cameras and say, “Don’t, we can’t have the cameras now.” [pause] It’s not like that, is it? [long pause] See, apathy’s alright, if— [inaudible; drowned out by George’s and George Martin’s voices]</p>\n<p>MICHAEL: [inaudible] —anyway.</p>\n<p>PAUL: That’s alright, it’s allowed.</p>\n<p>MICHAEL: Yeah, sure.</p>\n<p>PAUL: [inaudlble] —if it’s supposed to be opposite then you shouldn’t— [inaudible]</p>\n<p>MICHAEL: So it’s, “Everybody, pull your socks up”?</p>\n<p>PAUL: Sure it is, you know. Yeah I—</p>\n<p>MICHAEL: The first day was the best musical day, for me it was a musical day, yeah. Because you routined about four numbers. [long pause]</p>\n<p>PAUL: But I must say I’ll get, uh, put down, ’cause you know. Like if certain people aren’t interested, then I do… I lose interest. [long pause] And we can’t blame our tours or anything, or so on and so on and so on. [long pause] You see this one, that we’ve been having, this year, makes me really want to—</p>\n<p>GEORGE: Last year. Last year.</p>\n<p>PAUL: —snap out of it. Or snap into it. De-plastic it. But the past couple of months, you know, it’s been this, but the [White] album was like this, you see. The album was worse than this. This just seems sort of—</p>\n<p>MICHAEL: What, agony?</p>\n<p>PAUL: Well, just the whole idea of, do you want to do it? Do we want to do it? And that’s the joke, you see. After it all came about, Neil was saying to me we’d all phoned him individually, saying things like, you know, “Can you get ‘em together?” “Can you get it – oh, can you get it together?” “I want to know, what’re we doing?” You know. But like, instead of asking each other, we’ve all gone to Neil and asked him, “What’re the lads doing?” But you know, we should just have it out.</p>\n<p>GEORGE: But we keep coming up again, that one. And like you were saying, “Yeah well I’d like to do this, this, and that, yeah, and I’d like to do this, and I’d like to do that, and I’d like to do that,” and we end up doing something again that nobody really wants to do. [laughs]</p>\n<p>PAUL: Well then, you know, I think if this one—</p>\n<p>GEORGE: Make it public, at that.</p>\n<p>PAUL: Maybe it should definitely be the last for all of us. Because there just isn’t any point [inaudible]—</p>\n<p>GEORGE: Yeah, that’s it. [long pause]</p>\n<p>MICHAEL: I think I’d be sad. I mean, as an audience member, I’d be sad.</p>\n<p>PAUL: Of course it is! It’s stupid, you know! It is just stupid. But, it’s even more stupid the other way. To go through it. Because – you know.</p>\n<p>MICHAEL: I agree, but it’s—</p>\n<p>GEORGE: ’Cause this time we could be using for what you want to be doing—</p>\n<p>PAUL: You see, the thing is the people who are being stupid are the four of us. There’s nobody else. There’s only the four of us. You can’t actually, you know just sort of blame it on – ’cause there’s no other band, you know!</p>\n<p>GEORGE: —and being creative, instead of being like in the doldrums, which it always is now…</p>\n<p>MICHAEL: I wrote in my book, because I kind of keep a diary about what’s going on so I can cut it, and “doldrums” was the word I used. Because the doldrums have been coming, like – like to a ship on a [inaudible]—</p>\n<p>GEORGE: Oh, The Beatles have been in doldrums for at least a year.</p>\n<p>MICHAEL: You see, that is – that is terrible to say.</p>\n<p>PAUL: [desperate] We – we haven’t played together, you see! That’s the fucking thing. But when we do come together to play together, we all just sort of talk about the fleeting past! We’re like old-age pensioners! “Remember the days when we used to rock?” You know, but we’re here now! We can do it, you know. But I mean, I’m – all I hoping for is enthusiasm from you so—</p>\n<p>MICHAEL: That was – that was the idea—</p>\n<p>MAL: [earnest] I’d just like to say that you are needed, you know. The Beatles are needed. To so many people, you know.</p>\n<p>MICHAEL: Yeah, you’re right.</p>\n<p>MAL: Whatever you do.</p>\n<p>PAUL: You see the thing is also I – I get to a bit where I just sort of push all my ideas and I know that my ideas aren’t the best, you know. They are [mechanical voice] good, good, but they’re not the best, you know. But we can improve on it. Because we write songs together, and we improve on it. You know. [to Ringo] And you can improve on your drumming like it is, if you get into it. If you don’t, you know, okay, then I have better ideas, but if you get into it, you’re better! You know. It’s like that.</p>\n<p>GEORGE: And after all that, it’s like, you know, what do they say? It comes from a – and the eaves springs out of an E—</p>\n<p>MICHAEL: An ear.</p>\n<p>GEORGE: And that’s, you know, all that existentialist crap. [laughs]</p>\n<p>MICHAEL: Just like Jean-Paul, yeah, exactly.</p>\n<p>GEORGE: You know, it’s like…</p>\n<p>MICHAEL: You can call him John-Paul George, as opposed to Jean-Paul Sartre, you know. [laughs] We have a joke over here. You heard that, did you hear? Call him John-Paul George, as opposed to Jean-Paul Sartre, as a weird existentialism. [pause] Um, yeah. Like, it’s communication. And I think – I mean, see corny’s great, and like Mal said, it’s so corny that such a – I mean, he didn’t put it [as] corny, but it’s – you are terribly corny. [pause; scattered laughter] And that is what the world… [George starts singing ‘What The World Needs Now Is Love’] I mean really, ’cause – everyone in the world can say what they think except for you. We all need you. And you know, it’s the tears coming in the eyes of the little boy sitting in London as opposed to the little girl in America. And it’s communication. And it iss communication. And if you all can’t get it together, that’s really very sad. So, I feel what we should do now is let you play a little, and then you’ll have lunch together, and I can give you some more film, maybe. [pause]</p>\n<p>PAUL: Yes.</p>\n<p>MICHAEL: So, should we leave you for a while? I mean, if you—</p>\n<p>PAUL: Yes, yeah.</p>\n<h3 id=\"notes-3\">Notes</h3>\n<p>Captures the “doldrums” diagnosis and Paul’s “we haven’t played together” cry. Also underscores Mal and Michael’s view of The Beatles as culturally necessary, and Paul’s awareness that his ideas are not “the best” but need group refinement.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"5\">5</h2>\n<h3 id=\"overview-4\">Overview</h3>\n<p>In a quieter exchange, George explains why he’s sat on many songs for years, fearing they’d be dismissed in the studio; Paul argues that what matters is noticing problems together and resolving them. George floats, almost casually, the idea of a “divorce”. Paul says he’s already thought it; John breaks the tension with a joke about “the children”.</p>\n<h3 id=\"dialogue-4\">Dialogue</h3>\n<p>GEORGE: Well, what I was saying about the songs was like, the reason, you know, like, I’ve got about twenty songs from 1948 was because I knew very well the moment I’d bring them in the studio, that – [blows raspberry] there it’s gone, you know.</p>\n<p>PAUL: Yeah.</p>\n<p>GEORGE: And, uh, so I never did. And, like, slowly now, I can bring a couple out because I can get it more like how it should have been then. And that’s – you know, it’s like, it’s just…</p>\n<p>PAUL: You see, but it doesn’t matter what’s going wrong. It really doesn’t matter what’s going wrong, as long as the four of us notice it.</p>\n<p>GEORGE: [disbelieving; laughs] Well, I’ve noticed it, alright.</p>\n<p>PAUL: No, but and – and – instead of just noticing it, determine to put it right, you know. [pause] ‘Cause that’s what I’m – that’s what I’m onto.</p>\n<p>GEORGE: Maybe we should have a divorce.</p>\n<p>PAUL: Well, I said that last week, you know. But it’s getting nearer.</p>\n<p>JOHN: Who’d have the children?</p>\n<p>PAUL: [pause] Dick James.</p>\n<p>JOHN: Oh, yeah.</p>\n<h3 id=\"notes-4\">Notes</h3>\n<p>The “divorce” talk is still half-jokey, but grounded in George’s longstanding sense of being creatively sidelined. Paul tries to reframe it as a problem they can collectively “determine to put right”.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"6\">6</h2>\n<h3 id=\"overview-5\">Overview</h3>\n<p>Paul articulates, almost directly to John, his determination not to let the band “crack up” and his frustration that the four of them never truly “talk it out” together. He accuses John of talking down (or not talking at all), then immediately admits the same critique applies to himself.</p>\n<h3 id=\"dialogue-5\">Dialogue</h3>\n<p>PAUL: ’Cause you know, that’s what I was telling you on the phone, that… I’ll do it. Just because it is so silly of us now, at this point in our lives, to crack up. It’s just so silly. Because there’s no point! We’re not going to get anywhere that we wanna get by doing that. The only possible direction is the other way from that, you know. [pause] You know. That is the only possible direction. But the thing is we’re all just theoretically agreeing with it and not doing it. [to John] You’re doing your bit through you and Yoko, you know, but it’s silly, you know, to sort of, uh, coming and talking down to us. Well, actually your way out is not to talk, rather than talk down to us, which you’d have to do, you’d think, but you wouldn’t be. And remember, I think I’m talking down to you, too. [pause] But, you know, we’re not! [laughs bleakly] You know me. We’re all – we’re all alike, here, us four. But we just don’t sort of get to talk it out with each other.</p>\n<h3 id=\"notes-5\">Notes</h3>\n<p>A concise statement of the core communication problem: theoretical agreement without action, silence standing in for difficult conversation, and Paul’s recognition that the pattern includes his own behaviour.</p>",{headings:4127,localImagePaths:4152,remoteImagePaths:4153,frontmatter:4154,imagePaths:4157},[4128,4129,4130,4131,4132,4133,4134,4135,4136,4137,4138,4139,4140,4141,4142,4143,4144,4145,4146,4147,4148,4149,4150,4151],{depth:89,slug:3605,text:3605},{depth:64,slug:1581,text:1582},{depth:64,slug:1799,text:3608},{depth:64,slug:3570,text:3571},{depth:89,slug:3611,text:3611},{depth:64,slug:3613,text:1582},{depth:64,slug:3615,text:3608},{depth:64,slug:3617,text:3571},{depth:89,slug:3619,text:3619},{depth:64,slug:3621,text:1582},{depth:64,slug:3623,text:3608},{depth:64,slug:3625,text:3571},{depth:89,slug:3664,text:3664},{depth:64,slug:3666,text:1582},{depth:64,slug:3668,text:3608},{depth:64,slug:3670,text:3571},{depth:89,slug:3672,text:3672},{depth:64,slug:3674,text:1582},{depth:64,slug:3676,text:3608},{depth:64,slug:3678,text:3571},{depth:89,slug:3843,text:3843},{depth:64,slug:3845,text:1582},{depth:64,slug:3847,text:3608},{depth:64,slug:3849,text:3571},[],[],{title:4116,category:1789,date_range:4117,source:1791,reliability:1792,relevance:1793,tags:4155,created:4156},[1431,1795,1796,1797,1798,1799,4119,3586,3587,3589,3588,3590,4042],["Date","2025-12-19T00:00:00.000Z"],[],"get-back-dialogue-day-to-day/day-3-get-back.md","get-back-dialogue-day-to-day/day-6-get-back",{id:4159,data:4161,body:4167,filePath:4168,digest:4169,rendered:4170,legacyId:4200},{title:4162,category:1789,date_range:4163,source:1791,reliability:1792,relevance:1793,tags:4164,created:4166},"Get Back / Let It Be Sessions: Day 6 transcripts and notes","January 10, 1969",[1431,1795,1796,1797,1798,1799,4165,3586,3587,3589,3588,3590,4077,4042,3592],"1/10/1969",["Date","2025-12-19T00:00:00.000Z"],"## 1\r\n\r\n### Overview\r\n\r\nJanuary 10th, 1969: Following an (unrecorded) argument with John in the Twickenham Film Studios lunch room, George returns to the studio floor and announces he’s leaving The Beatles. He then drives out of London to Liverpool, where he writes ‘Wah Wah’.\r\n\r\n### Dialogue\r\n\r\nGEORGE: —I think I’ll be leaving the band now.\r\n\r\nJOHN: When?\r\n\r\nGEORGE: Now. [audio cuts off]\r\n\r\n### Notes\r\n\r\nThe walkout itself is almost shockingly brief in the audio; the weight comes from context and everything that follows.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 2\r\n\r\n### Overview\r\n\r\nWith George gone, George Martin, Neil Aspinall, and Michael Lindsay-Hogg discuss why. They highlight the Lennon–McCartney partnership as an entrenched “team” that leaves George isolated as “his own team.”\r\n\r\n### Dialogue\r\n\r\nMICHAEL: The trouble is, once you leave, it’s very hard to come back.\r\n\r\nNEIL: Not really. We’ll all have to meet him on Sunday, anyway. So he could be back, then. No, really, the box that George is in is, um – it’s him versus John and Paul when it comes to what he’s got to do and what he has to play.\r\n\r\nGEORGE M.: And there’s the songwriting. Because they’re a songwriting team, and he’s – he’s his own team. And [inaudible] it’s tough. \r\n\r\nMICHAEL: Yes, but – John and Paul aren’t writing together much anymore, are they, really?\r\n\r\nGEORGE M.: No, but nevertheless, they’re still a team. \r\n\r\n### Notes\r\n\r\nNeatly articulates George’s “box”: still structurally outside the Lennon–McCartney axis even as that axis is itself fraying.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 3\r\n\r\n### Overview\r\n\r\nWhile Paul plays Barber’s ‘Adagio for Strings’ in the background, Michael, Glyn, and Mal chat about touring war stories. John and Ringo join in, talking about hotels, tours, and having eggs thrown at the band in Australia.\r\n\r\n### Dialogue\r\n\r\nJOHN: [American accent] Oh yes. Why, I think of it every day. I think what fun we had, when we was The Beatles, playing and rocking, with the group around the world. I said, “Richard, you remember that?” And he says, “No, I hadn’t joined you then.” [laughter]\r\n\r\nRINGO: The hotels, I have very fond memories of.\r\n\r\nJOHN: [laughs] Yeah.\r\n\r\nRINGO: The tour, I’m not so fond of.\r\n\r\nJOHN: Having eggs thrown at us in Australia was one of my big moments.\r\n\r\nRINGO: I was away for a long time with tonsilitis. [laughs]\r\n\r\nJOHN: Ah, yes.\r\n\r\nMICHAEL: Who went out instead?\r\n\r\nRINGO: Bobby Nicol, Jimmie Nicol?\r\n\r\nMICHAEL: Jimmie Nicol?\r\n\r\nJOHN: Jimmie Nicol, who is now making a living as the twenty-ninth Beatle in New Mexico. [Michael laughs]\r\n\r\n### Notes\r\n\r\nNostalgic and jokey, but also underscores the split between fond memories (hotels) and trauma/exhaustion (tours).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 4\r\n\r\n### Overview\r\n\r\nLater that day, with George gone, Paul, Ringo, Maureen, Mal, Neil, George Martin, and Michael fall into extended knock-knock jokes and absurd “where should we play?” fantasies. John and Yoko re-enter while papers are being read; Paul makes a pointed “Mersey Beat Couple of the Year / Irritant of the Year” joke about them.\r\n\r\n### Dialogue\r\n\r\nGEORGE M.: Oh I do like to be beside the seaside…\r\n\r\nMICHAEL: So at the moment, how’s America looking? Where’s, uh—\r\n\r\nRINGO: America doesn’t… it isn’t nice at all.\r\n\r\nMICHAEL: Doesn’t look nice at all. [pause] Where’s he gone?\r\n\r\nGEORGE M.: John?\r\n\r\nMICHAEL: Four-eyes.\r\n\r\nRINGO: He’s most probably off painting somewhere.\r\n\r\nPAUL: [snorts] Yeah, yeah. Sketching.\r\n\r\nMICHAEL: Sketching, or writing a quick poem. Or a book. Or a diary.\r\n\r\nPAUL: Probably in a bag in his dressing room with Yoko, you know. [general laughter] They brought their own bag with ‘em today.\r\n\r\nMICHAEL: Hence the expression…\r\n\r\nGEORGE M.: “Papa’s got a—“\r\n\r\nMICHAEL & GEORGE M.: “—brand new bag.”\r\n\r\nGEORGE M.: Snap.\r\n\r\nMICHAEL: Snap. [laughs] “Papa’s got a brand new bag-snap.” Or a zip. So, uh… [long pause] The seven men are going out to Africa on Monday, right? [uproarious laughter] We’ve got a reconnaissance team.\r\n\r\nPAUL: Seven Zulus going to Willesden on Monday. [laughter] To check it out.\r\n\r\nMICHAEL: No, we keep adding all the time.\r\n\r\nPAUL: Or Paddington Town Hall.\r\n\r\nRINGO: A special hired jet Boeing 707 is taking a full haul to Constaninopole. To see what the weather’s like.\r\n\r\nMICHAEL: [laughs] And the show will be done in Ethiopia.\r\n\r\nRINGO: That’s a nice place. Did someone say that before?\r\n\r\nMICHAEL: Ethiopia? Oh, that’s my joke! Do you remember my joke of Haile Selassie?\r\n\r\nGEORGE M.: The Abyssinian?\r\n\r\nRINGO: Isn’t he Brazilian?\r\n\r\nMICHAEL: No, no – the punchline is “Haile Selassie”.\r\n\r\nRINGO: Then what’s the bit before?\r\n\r\nMICHAEL: And the bit before is, “Do you want to buy my tomatoes?” Do you want to buy my – it’s a queer Moroccan joke which I made up.\r\n\r\nRINGO: “Do you want to buy my tomatoes?” “Haile Selassie.” [laughs]\r\n\r\nPAUL: Very good joke.\r\n\r\nGEORGE M.: Did you tell it to anyone here? Have we heard it yet?\r\n\r\nMICHAEL: Well, some of them heard it on the first day, and rejected it. “Haile Selassie.” See, I thought it was a kind of nice rough trade, New York joke. “Haile Selassie.” But it goes through a list of things you would sell for money. [laughter] I find this very funny! I—\r\n\r\nRINGO: Do you want to buy my potatoes?\r\n\r\nMICHAEL: No.\r\n\r\nRINGO: Princess Margaret. [Michael laughs]\r\n\r\nPAUL: [inaudible]\r\n\r\nRINGO: Knock knock.\r\n\r\nMICHAEL: Who’s there?\r\n\r\nRINGO: Charlie.\r\n\r\nMICHAEL: Charlie who?\r\n\r\nRINGO: Elizabeth Harden. [long pause; general laughter]\r\n\r\nMICHAEL: I love knock-knocks. We were going to do one for the [Rock ‘n’ Roll] Circus, we were gonna have “Knock knock, who’s there?” and someone was gonna say, “That’s right.” And then, “What do you mean, ‘That’s right?’”\r\n\r\nRINGO: [in background; to Maureen] I stole it from you, my dear, I know that. [Maureen laughs]\r\n\r\nPAUL: [laughs] I don’t get it!\r\n\r\nRINGO: What?\r\n\r\nPAUL: “Charlie Elizabeth Harden”? [general laughter]\r\n\r\nMICHAEL: The “who”, the “who” is there.\r\n\r\nMAL: [laughs] That’s what you do!\r\n\r\nRINGO: “Michael.” “Michael who?” “Bill and Ben.” [general laughter]\r\n\r\nMICHAEL: I love knock-knocks.\r\n\r\nGEORGE M.: I like the song ones.\r\n\r\nMICHAEL: Who’s there?\r\n\r\nGEORGE M.: Knock knock.\r\n\r\nRINGO: Arthur. Is that?\r\n\r\nMICHAEL: Is that who?\r\n\r\nRINGO: Is that your Cornetto? [Michael laughs]\r\n\r\nMICHAEL: Hiawatha.\r\n\r\nRINGO: Hiawatha who?\r\n\r\nMICHAEL: Hiawatha good little boy till I met you.\r\n\r\nGEORGE M.: Knock knock.\r\n\r\nMICHAEL: Who’s there?\r\n\r\nGEORGE M.: It is Simon.\r\n\r\nMICHAEL: Simon who?\r\n\r\nGEORGE M.: Simon chanting evening… [general laughter]\r\n\r\nPAUL: [to John and Yoko?; Cockney accent] Get in your bag! Get in here boy and get in your bloody bag! Go on! [long pause; rustling; thick Northern accent] The Mersey Beat Awards for Couple of the Year goes to John and Yoko. [long pause] Irritant of the Year. [pause; nervous laughter]\r\n\r\nMAL: Is he the Irritant of the Year?\r\n\r\nRINGO: No.\r\n\r\nPAUL: Private Eye. On the paper.\r\n\r\nRINGO: Oh, that’s – I did see that, I apologise.\r\n\r\nPAUL: Lying again.\r\n\r\nRINGO: [referring to newspaper] See, I want that curly hair.\r\n\r\nPAUL: Yeah, great, isn’t it? Bernard Levin.\r\n\r\nRINGO: Bernard, that’s the one. I don’t want to say his name in case he sees me. [reading] “Yes, we’ve done it again!” says the Daily Mirror.\r\n\r\nPAUL: “Yes, they’ve done it again!” says the Daily Mail.\r\n\r\nRINGO: “Yes, we’ve—” [inaudible]\r\n\r\nPAUL: “Well, we’ve missed it again!” says the daily work. [bleak; laughs]\r\n\r\nMICHAEL: Would anybody like a cup of tea?\r\n\r\nRINGO: No thank you.\r\n\r\nPAUL: Yes, I’d like a cup of tea. With saffron.\r\n\r\n### Notes\r\n\r\nThe gallows humour, surreal venue suggestions, and “Mersey Beat Couple of the Year / Irritant of the Year” bit all sit on top of the day’s real crisis: George has just walked out.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 5\r\n\r\n### Overview\r\n\r\nIn the immediate aftermath of George’s departure, John floats replacing him with Eric Clapton and bluntly raises the question: “do we want to carry on The Beatles?” Yoko’s repetitive vocalizing becomes part of a strange, tense jam as Michael tries to plan the show’s future.\r\n\r\n### Dialogue\r\n\r\nMICHAEL: I’ll check. [pause] Glyn! Glyn. Yoko wants a mic.\r\n\r\nJOHN: I think, uh, if George doesn’t come back by Monday or Tuesday, we ask Eric Clapton to play in it.\r\n\r\nMAL: [inaudible]\r\n\r\nJOHN: I mean, if George is leaving the group—\r\n\r\nRINGO: [inaudible] —then why did he leave the Creem group?\r\n\r\nJOHN: But no, Eric would be pleased if George— He left Creem because they’re all—\r\n\r\nRINGO: All soloists.\r\n\r\nJOHN: —all soloists. Were it not [inaudible] he’d have full scope to play his guitar. The point is, if George leaves, do we want to carry on The Beatles? I do. [inaudible; drowned out by mic feedback] And I’d just get another member of the group and carry on. But if The Beatles split, well, I’ll get another group. [to Paul and Yoko?] I’m a singer not a dancer, baby! Woo-hoo!\r\n\r\nMAL:\r\n\r\nPersonally— [inaudible] —do you really want to do it over here?\r\n\r\nRINGO: I don’t particularly want to do it with another Beatle, but I will.\r\n\r\nJOHN: Well hello there, Michael Lindsay Hogg.\r\n\r\nMICHAEL: We have a lot of shots of the empty seat, we can lay the dialogue over it like in two movie times.\r\n\r\nJOHN: We are?\r\n\r\nMICHAEL: [laughs] Maybe we’re not going to get very much. [long pause] You see, maybe for the show, you could just say George was sick.\r\n\r\nJOHN: No – I mean if he leaves, he leaves.\r\n\r\nYOKO: [in background] John… John… John…\r\n\r\nMICHAEL: But what’s the consensus? Do you want to go on with the show and the work?\r\n\r\nJOHN: Yeah. If he doesn’t come back by Tuesday, we’ll get Clapton in.\r\n\r\nYOKO: John… John… John…\r\n\r\nJOHN: What!\r\n\r\nYOKO: John!\r\n\r\nJOHN: [screaming] What!\r\n\r\nYOKO: John… John… John…\r\n\r\nJOHN: Yoko! Anything you say, dear! I brought the tea!\r\n\r\nYOKO: [screaming] John! John! John!\r\n\r\nJOHN: [screaming] Yes!\r\n\r\nYOKO: John?\r\n\r\nJOHN: Yoko.\r\n\r\nYOKO: John…\r\n\r\nJOHN: Yoko!\r\n\r\nYOKO: John…\r\n\r\nJOHN: Yoko!\r\n\r\nYOKO: John…\r\n\r\nJOHN: Stop that.\r\n\r\nYOKO: John… John…\r\n\r\nMICHAEL: We could get Ike or Tina Turner over.\r\n\r\nJOHN: Instead of George?\r\n\r\nMICHAEL: Yeah.\r\n\r\nYOKO: John… John… John…\r\n\r\nRINGO: I’m afraid he’s not in!\r\n\r\nYOKO: John! John! John!\r\n\r\nJOHN: He’s busy!\r\n\r\nYOKO: [screaming] John… John… John…\r\n\r\nJOHN: Yes?\r\n\r\nMICHAEL: What do the other lads feel?\r\n\r\nMAL: Broken. ‘Cause we want to feel what the lads feel.\r\n\r\nMICHAEL: About – just going on?\r\n\r\nMAL: Essentially.\r\n\r\nMICHAEL: Do it.\r\n\r\nYOKO: [screaming] John! John! John!\r\n\r\nJOHN: Bloody mad.\r\n\r\nMICHAEL: And then what about the venues, as they say in the rock ’n’ roll— [audio mutes] —it’s a funny thing to say, but if it’s… I don’t know, I was going to say if – if it is – if George comes back we go away, and if Eric comes in we stay here. But I think if – I think we should go away.\r\n\r\nJOHN: I think we should just go on, though.\r\n\r\nMICHAEL: I think we should go away.\r\n\r\nJOHN: As if nothing’s happening.\r\n\r\nMICHAEL: Yeah.

We’ll all have to meet him on Sunday, anyway. So he could be back, then. No, really, the box that George is in is, um – it’s him versus John and Paul when it comes to what he’s got to do and what he has to play.</p>\n<p>GEORGE M.: And there’s the songwriting. Because they’re a songwriting team, and he’s – he’s his own team. And [inaudible] it’s tough.</p>\n<p>MICHAEL: Yes, but – John and Paul aren’t writing together much anymore, are they, really?</p>\n<p>GEORGE M.: No, but nevertheless, they’re still a team.</p>\n<h3 id=\"notes-1\">Notes</h3>\n<p>Neatly articulates George’s “box”: still structurally outside the Lennon–McCartney axis even as that axis is itself fraying.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"3\">3</h2>\n<h3 id=\"overview-2\">Overview</h3>\n<p>While Paul plays Barber’s ‘Adagio for Strings’ in the background, Michael, Glyn, and Mal chat about touring war stories.

Why, I think of it every day. I think what fun we had, when we was The Beatles, playing and rocking, with the group around the world.

Sketching.</p>\n<p>MICHAEL: Sketching, or writing a quick poem. Or a book. Or a diary.</p>\n<p>PAUL: Probably in a bag in his dressing room with Yoko, you know. [general laughter] They brought their own bag with ‘em today.</p>\n<p>MICHAEL: Hence the expression…</p>\n<p>GEORGE M.: “Papa’s got a—“</p>\n<p>MICHAEL &#x26; GEORGE M.: “—brand new bag.”</p>\n<p>GEORGE M.: Snap.</p>\n<p>MICHAEL: Snap.

Oh, that’s my joke! Do you remember my joke of Haile Selassie?</p>\n<p>GEORGE M.: The Abyssinian?</p>\n<p>RINGO: Isn’t he Brazilian?</p>\n<p>MICHAEL: No, no – the punchline is “Haile Selassie”.</p>\n<p>RINGO: Then what’s the bit before?</p>\n<p>MICHAEL: And the bit before is, “Do you want to buy my tomatoes?” Do you want to buy my – it’s a queer Moroccan joke which I made up.</p>\n<p>RINGO: “Do you want to buy my tomatoes?” “Haile Selassie.” [laughs]</p>\n<p>PAUL: Very good joke.</p>\n<p>GEORGE M.: Did you tell it to anyone here? Have we heard it yet?</p>\n<p>MICHAEL: Well, some of them heard it on the first day, and rejected it. “Haile Selassie.” See, I thought it was a kind of nice rough trade, New York joke. “Haile Selassie.” But it goes through a list of things you would sell for money. [laughter] I find this very funny! I—</p>\n<p>RINGO: Do you want to buy my potatoes?</p>\n<p>MICHAEL: No.</p>\n<p>RINGO: Princess Margaret.

[long pause; general laughter]</p>\n<p>MICHAEL: I love knock-knocks.

[Maureen laughs]</p>\n<p>PAUL: [laughs] I don’t get it!</p>\n<p>RINGO: What?</p>\n<p>PAUL: “Charlie Elizabeth Harden”? [general laughter]</p>\n<p>MICHAEL: The “who”, the “who” is there.</p>\n<p>MAL: [laughs] That’s what you do!</p>\n<p>RINGO: “Michael.” “Michael who?” “Bill and Ben.” [general laughter]</p>\n<p>MICHAEL: I love knock-knocks.</p>\n<p>GEORGE M.: I like the song ones.</p>\n<p>MICHAEL: Who’s there?</p>\n<p>GEORGE M.: Knock knock.</p>\n<p>RINGO: Arthur.

Bernard Levin.</p>\n<p>RINGO: Bernard, that’s the one. I don’t want to say his name in case he sees me.

[pause] Glyn! Glyn. Yoko wants a mic.</p>\n<p>JOHN: I think, uh, if George doesn’t come back by Monday or Tuesday, we ask Eric Clapton to play in it.</p>\n<p>MAL: [inaudible]</p>\n<p>JOHN: I mean, if George is leaving the group—</p>\n<p>RINGO: [inaudible] —then why did he leave the Creem group?</p>\n<p>JOHN: But no, Eric would be pleased if George— He left Creem because they’re all—</p>\n<p>RINGO: All soloists.</p>\n<p>JOHN: —all soloists. Were it not [inaudible] he’d have full scope to play his guitar. The point is, if George leaves, do we want to carry on The Beatles? I do. [inaudible; drowned out by mic feedback] And I’d just get another member of the group and carry on. But if The Beatles split, well, I’ll get another group. [to Paul and Yoko?] I’m a singer not a dancer, baby! Woo-hoo!</p>\n<p>MAL:</p>\n<p>Personally— [inaudible] —do you really want to do it over here?</p>\n<p>RINGO: I don’t particularly want to do it with another Beatle, but I will.</p>\n<p>JOHN: Well hello there, Michael Lindsay Hogg.</p>\n<p>MICHAEL: We have a lot of shots of the empty seat, we can lay the dialogue over it like in two movie times.</p>\n<p>JOHN: We are?</p>\n<p>MICHAEL: [laughs] Maybe we’re not going to get very much. [long pause] You see, maybe for the show, you could just say George was sick.</p>\n<p>JOHN: No – I mean if he leaves, he leaves.</p>\n<p>YOKO: [in background] John… John… John…</p>\n<p>MICHAEL: But what’s the consensus? Do you want to go on with the show and the work?</p>\n<p>JOHN: Yeah. If he doesn’t come back by Tuesday, we’ll get Clapton in.</p>\n<p>YOKO: John… John… John…</p>\n<p>JOHN: What!</p>\n<p>YOKO: John!</p>\n<p>JOHN: [screaming] What!</p>\n<p>YOKO: John… John… John…</p>\n<p>JOHN: Yoko!

John! John!</p>\n<p>JOHN: Bloody mad.</p>\n<p>MICHAEL: And then what about the venues, as they say in the rock ’n’ roll— [audio mutes] —it’s a funny thing to say, but if it’s… I don’t know, I was going to say if – if it is – if George comes back we go away, and if Eric comes in we stay here. But I think if – I think we should go away.</p>\n<p>JOHN: I think we should just go on, though.</p>\n<p>MICHAEL: I think we should go away.</p>\n<p>JOHN: As if nothing’s happening.</p>\n<p>MICHAEL: Yeah.

Neil reassures Paul and Ringo that George still cares about the band, and only wants to settle everything equally and honestly amongst the four of them, without any outsiders.\r\n\r\nAmidst everyone’s comments about Yoko’s over-involvement (ergo John’s recalcitrance), Paul admits that the protective seal the band formed around themselves over the years has made it difficult for them to regard anyone unfamiliar into their faction without some measure of hostility and paranoia – especially if they have been asserted into a creative and professional position equal to their own, as Yoko has by John.\r\n\r\n### Dialogue\r\n\r\nPAUL: Waiting for you, ooh… Why don’t you know… what it could be…\r\n\r\nLINDA: It’s a good thing if all four of you just got together – and nobody else. You know, it’s alright when we’re all just sitting around now.\r\n\r\nRINGO: Did you go last night, Neil?\r\n\r\nNEIL: Um – this is, um, just something I was talking to George about last night. And that was what he was saying, too.\r\n\r\nRINGO: What?\r\n\r\nNEIL: What he means. [About] just the four of you.\r\n\r\nLINDA: Yeah, it’s—\r\n\r\nNEIL: That’s what he means, you know. Nothing else.\r\n\r\nRINGO: Yes.\r\n\r\nPAUL: Yeah, I’m for that, you know.\r\n\r\nNEIL: So am I.\r\n\r\nRINGO: Yes.\r\n\r\nLINDA: It’s the only way you’re gonna—\r\n\r\nNEIL: That’s why he didn’t – that’s why he said, “I don’t believe you,” to John. Yesterday.\r\n\r\nPAUL: Yeah… Key moment, that, wasn’t it?\r\n\r\nNEIL: [wry] Yes. But he meant it. And I think John knew what he was talking about, too.\r\n\r\nPAUL: Oh, John. [laughter] Sure he did.\r\n\r\nNEIL: And that’s why George said it twice. When John said, “I don’t understand you, George,” and George said, “I don’t believe you. Forget it.” ‘Cause he thought [John] did understand him.\r\n\r\nPAUL: [unsurprised] Of course he did.\r\n\r\nLINDA: [wry] It was great.\r\n\r\nNEIL: You know, and it’s that. It’s like the bullshitting bit where, like, that can go on, is silly.\r\n\r\nPAUL: Yeah. But I think the thing is, like, we – John does bullshit, I bullshit, Ringo bullshits, George bullshits. You know, we bullshit. The problem is that it’s only John— [inaudible; Michael Lindsay-Hogg’s voice recording a phone call] —trying to be more influencing, and they’re thinking past it. And so you start to sort of give him more credit than he’s – than he’s due for, you know. And, like, with Yoko, you know – they’re real. They mean it.\r\n\r\nLINDA: [laughs] I don’t dig that, though.\r\n\r\nPAUL: Him and Yoko, you know, they – they—\r\n\r\nLINDA: [pretends to sneeze] Go away!\r\n\r\nPAUL: You know, they do mean it. But…\r\n\r\nNEIL: [playing along] Everybody cough. Heeueck.\r\n\r\nLINDA: [playing along] Heuuuueck go away. Heeueck.\r\n\r\nPAUL: [sober] You know?\r\n\r\nLINDA: [sincere] Yeah, I know what you mean. You know what you mean.\r\n\r\nPAUL: But you know, I – I tend to think that about them, too. Like I was saying, you know. “Well, I’d rather write without Yoko, thank you.” Just because it’s – that’s the way I write. If I – like, if I was in Tunisia, I’d go up to the bathroom to write a song, and then come back when it was done to show it to you. And to sort of say, “Let’s do a couple more words, now that’s it all there, you know, now that there’s only a little…”\r\n\r\nNEIL: Yeah.\r\n\r\nPAUL: But it’s difficult starting right from scratch with Yoko there, ‘cause you start off on a – well, I do. I start off on a Yoko beam, you know. I start off sort of writing songs about white walls. [laughter] Just ‘cause I – you know, just ‘cause I think she – John and Yoko would like that. And they wouldn’t, you know. I mean, I give them too much credit for – for what I think they’d like. But that’s not true. They wouldn’t. They’re very straight. […] I mean, you know, it’s just like—\r\n\r\nLINDA: It’s all about being away from each other, aren’t they?\r\n\r\nPAUL: I think it’s—\r\n\r\nNEIL: No, I don’t – I don’t think it’s that.\r\n\r\nRINGO: Did you get in touch with John?\r\n\r\nNEIL: Um, Mal did. This morning, in fact.\r\n\r\nLINDA: That was the answering service.\r\n\r\nRINGO: [to Neil] Oh, you guys – I thought you were, later on.\r\n\r\nNEIL: I couldn’t get him.\r\n\r\nRINGO: No?\r\n\r\nMICHAEL: Is he join – is he joining us?\r\n\r\nRINGO: We don’t know.\r\n\r\nNEIL: I suppose [John and Yoko] might, but nobody can expect as much.\r\n\r\nRINGO: ‘Cause Mal couldn’t get him either, you know. He may be up now.\r\n\r\nNEIL: So – nobody’s spoken to him?\r\n\r\nRINGO: No no no. You can only get the machine. So someone should try again.\r\n\r\nNEIL: [inaudible] But nobody’s answering it.\r\n\r\nLINDA: [to Paul] Yeah, but it’s hard having a meeting, and everybody putting their two cents in and none of you all saying – anything.\r\n\r\nPAUL: But that’s the other thing, having the meeting, you know. You came with me, and Heather came, and the animal—\r\n\r\nLINDA: Yeah, I was going to say I shouldn’t go, but then…\r\n\r\nPAUL: Yeah… [lighthearted] It’s such a temptation going out to Ringo’s for the afternoon.\r\n\r\nLINDA: [laughs] Exactly.\r\n\r\nRINGO: [bemused] What?\r\n\r\nLINDA: Heather could play with Zak.\r\n\r\nPAUL: It feels like a family outing. [Ringo laughs] Don’t really just want to go on my own.\r\n\r\nLINDA: [sheepish] Yeah, I was going to say, “We really shouldn’t go,” but then I thought – well.\r\n\r\nRINGO: Why?\r\n\r\nLINDA: Well, it should’ve been—\r\n\r\nPAUL: Well, it should have been the four of us, you know.\r\n\r\nRINGO: Oh— [to Linda; reasonable] Well, you were out of the way.\r\n\r\nPAUL: Oh, yeah, sure.\r\n\r\nLINDA: Sure.\r\n\r\nRINGO: I mean— [inaudible]\r\n\r\nLINDA: Oh yeah, but you know, it’s just like…\r\n\r\nPAUL: It’s – it’s still, it’s that thing, you know.\r\n\r\nRINGO: Mm.\r\n\r\nLINDA: When there’s something serious, and you have other people there talking about it, you get off the track.\r\n\r\nPAUL: You know, it really is – it really is like a board meeting going on.\r\n\r\nRINGO: [mock-stern; to Linda] If you would’ve just kept quiet, it could’ve all gone well.\r\n\r\nLINDA: [playing along] Well, I had to talk every two minutes. [laughs]\r\n\r\nPAUL: Ol’ Sir Joberry and his wife…\r\n\r\nRINGO: [playing along] Damn Yankee. [laughter]\r\n\r\nPAUL: You know, but that’s it. It’s like that. The board meeting with ICLI, and all the government bringing all the wives, [laughs] and mates, and kids, and animals – and everything.\r\n\r\nNEIL: But it turns – it turns into— [inaudible]\r\n\r\nLINDA: Well, Yoko is doing all the talking.\r\n\r\nNEIL: But that’s – that’s the point, you see. You know that he’s going to, and you know that Yoko’s going to be sitting there, and so everybody else is like, “Fuck it.” You know it’s not going to be a [proper] board meeting, so…\r\n\r\nPAUL: Yeah, right.\r\n\r\nNEIL: “Let’s make it a party.”\r\n\r\nPAUL: Sure, that’s – that, really, that—\r\n\r\nLINDA: But she does so much talking for [John], now.\r\n\r\nPAUL: But see, now, so what do you do about that? That’s what I was saying about songs, yesterday, you know. I’m – I know that if – to write any more with John, I’ve just gotta, like, figh– [faltering] you know, forget it.\r\n\r\nLINDA: But I think that whole—\r\n\r\nPAUL: See I think it’s – it’s us, uptight about that. I really do – I think, uh…\r\n\r\nLINDA: The king.\r\n\r\nPAUL: See, it’s like – the trouble with us – like, John said it yesterday – it’s like, anything that comes up on all of our little egos, we try and push out. And anybody – it’s always been that. Anybody who’s come in, like Michael Braun – who was writing that book – came in for a while, within the circle for a while, but then he gets pushed out. ‘Cause, you know, we don’t want him in the inner circle. He’s got to stay on the edges, while the four of us get on with – you know.\r\n\r\n### Notes\r\n\r\n(Your long contextual note about the meeting, John & Yoko’s phone disconnection, and the popular narrative vs. actual cause of George’s quitting belongs here; you can paste it from the master file if you want it preserved verbatim.)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 2\r\n\r\n### Overview\r\n\r\nJanuary 13th, 1969 (Twickenham Film Studios, London): During a morning discussion of John and Yoko’s conduct and its unnerving impact on the Beatles, Linda offers her observation of what was (and wasn’t) communicated by John and Yoko during a tense band meeting held the previous night.\r\n\r\n### Dialogue\r\n\r\nLINDA: ’Cause I have a feeling that half the stuff Yoko said yesterday isn’t – I mean, she was talking for John, and I don’t think he really believed any of that, you know.\r\n\r\n### Notes\r\n\r\nConcise outside perspective: Linda separates what Yoko says from what John actually believes, crystallizing the “Yoko talking for John” dynamic.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 3\r\n\r\n### Overview\r\n\r\nJanuary 13th, 1969: As everyone waits for John and Yoko to arrive, Paul talks about John’s uncommunicativeness and how silence becomes John’s defense. He sketches two possible responses to Yoko’s presence: “fight her” or accept that she’s there and John won’t leave her for their sake. Michael and Linda suggest John doesn’t really want to stop being a Beatle.\r\n\r\n### Dialogue\r\n\r\nNEIL: I’d just rather not say anything. It’s one of those situations. \r\n\r\nPAUL: Yeah. [pause] Well, that’s – that’s the trouble you see, there, ‘cause that’s it. It’s like, with our – heightened awareness, the answer is not to say anything, you know. But it isn’t. ‘Cause I mean, we screw each other up totally if we don’t do that. ‘Cause we’re not ready for your heightened… vows of silence. [laughs; hapless] We’re really not! Like, we don’t know what the fuck each other’s talking about, when that – we all just sort of get—\r\n\r\nNEIL: I think it’s just between the four of you, that get it. That’s what I’d pretend. \r\n\r\nPAUL: Oh yeah, right, yeah. But you see, that’s it, that’s why John doesn’t say anything. ‘Cause he, you know, he just… There was something the other day, when I said, “Well, what do you think?” And he just stood there and didn’t say anything. And then – and I know exactly why, you know. I mean, I wouldn’t, if… [long pause] Somehow. You know, there’s nothing really much to be said about it. You just – we all just have to do it, and all that, instead of like talking about it. But – but if one of us is talking about it, it’s a drag if the other three aren’t. Because then it sort of throws you off. [inaudible; voice marking tape slate] I mean, we’ve just been talking about it now for a few years, you know. Like this… \r\n\r\nMICHAEL: How long has this been around? Like a year? \r\n\r\nLINDA: But that’s not it, anyway. It’s the four of them just getting together. \r\n\r\nPAUL: [hesitating] But that’s – that’s not far off it, you know. I mean…\r\n\r\nLINDA: What?\r\n\r\nPAUL: I mean, Yoko’s very much to do with it.\r\n\r\nLINDA: Mm.\r\n\r\nPAUL: ‘Cause she’s very much to do with it from John’s angle, that’s the thing, you know. And I – the thing is that I – there’s— Again, like, there’s always only two answers. One is to fight it, and fight her, and try and get The Beatles back to four people without Yoko, and sort of ask her to sit down at the board meetings. Or else, the other thing is to just realize that she’s there, you know. And he’s not gonna sort of – split with her, just for our sakes.\r\n\r\nAnd – but then it’s not even so much of an obstacle, then, as long as we’re not trying to surmount it. And while we’re still trying to get over it, it’s an obstacle. [trying] But it isn’t, really. It’s not that bad, you know. They want to stay together, those two. So it’s alright. Let the young lovers stay together. [pause] But it shouldn’t be, “We can’t operate under these conditions, boy. You know, we’re coming out.” It’s like – it feels like we’re striking. That’s what it is. It’s like a strike, ‘cause work conditions aren’t right, you know. But… it’s not that bad. \r\n\r\nMICHAEL: But, he – he knows that, doesn’t he?  \r\n\r\nPAUL: John knows that, sure. But he’s—\r\n\r\nMICHAEL: Does he talk about it at all?\r\n\r\nPAUL: No. But he’s – I mean, he’s— See, we’ve done a lot of Beatles now, we’ve had a lot of Beatles, you know, and we’ve got a lot out of Beatles. So that it – I think John’s saying now that honestly, if it came to a push between Yoko and The Beatles, it’s Yoko, you know. \r\n\r\nMICHAEL: Who’d stay. \r\n\r\nPAUL: Oh, sure. \r\n\r\nMICHAEL: But funny enough, the other day, when we were talking, he said that he really did not want not to be a Beatle. He said he really looked forward – not, you know. Meaning he didn’t want that screwed up. \r\n\r\nPAUL: Hm. [pause; unconvinced] Yeah, but it’s a difficult one, that, you know. \r\n\r\nLINDA: I think in their discussions, though, when as soon as you brought that up, John turned to her and said, “See, I told you.” I think it’s one of those things where he—\r\n\r\nPAUL: They do it. They tell each other, you know, when they get back home— \r\n\r\nLINDA: Yeah, but I bet he said to her, you know, “When I write, just sort of go away, when I’m with Paul.” But she said, “Oh, I don’t know…” [trailing off] It’s that kind of thing.\r\n\r\nPAUL: [quiet] I don’t know. \r\n\r\n### Notes\r\n\r\n(Your commentary about inevitability of the breakup and John’s double-edged reticence can live here, copied from the master file.)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 4\r\n\r\n### Overview\r\n\r\nJanuary 13th, 1969: While waiting for John and Yoko, Paul explains to Michael why it’s hard to talk to John without Yoko present. He accepts their ideological desire to be constantly together, but points out that if it “screws everything up for everybody else,” they also have to think about that.\r\n\r\n### Dialogue\r\n\r\nLINDA: I think he’d do it but I don’t think she’d do it.\r\n\r\nPAUL: See, but their point is, they’re – they’re trying to be as near together as they can. \r\n\r\nMICHAEL: For their own truth, and everything jazz.\r\n\r\nPAUL: Yeah, for everything like – so that if she sits over here, then it’s just slightly less good than if she’s sitting that near, very near to him. And if she’s touching him, then that’s even better, you know. And it’s like that. So that, okay, she’s prepared to sit here, but that’s – then there’s the beginning of the rock down. Then she’ll stay at home the next day, while he comes [to the studio], you know. And they see it like that. They see it that the more that they can stay together – and it’s right, in a way. I – you know. If that’s how you see it, then you can see that it would be a drag for that  for people to start saying, “Well, come to the meeting without her,” you know, “I’d rather talk without her,” ’cause it starts separating you again, from her. Which is like, see, it’s very ideological. Which is, you know, it’s probably how it should be.\r\n\r\nMICHAEL: I’m all for that. I mean, if that’s what they want to do. But then if it screws everything up for everybody else, then they’ve got to think about it.\r\n\r\nPAUL: [reserved] Well. I don’t know, you know. You see, they – they’d say that the other way, that—\r\n\r\nMICHAEL: That you’d have to adjust to them.\r\n\r\nPAUL: [weary] —that the other way is true, yeah. You know, that if they do what we want to do, then it might screw it up for them, you know. And they don’t want to be screwed up.\r\n\r\n### Notes\r\n\r\nPaul walks a careful line between respecting John/Yoko’s ideology and naming the cost to the band.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 5\r\n\r\n### Overview\r\n\r\nJanuary 13th, 1969 (Twickenham): After more than an hour of waiting for John and Yoko, Neil reports that the phone is still off the hook. Linda suggests sending a telegram saying Paul is “on pins and needles.” Michael jokes grimly about putting Yoko back in the bag; Paul mutters, “And then there were two.”\r\n\r\n### Dialogue\r\n\r\nNEIL: Mal’s trying to ring him.\r\n\r\nPAUL: Yeah?\r\n\r\nNEIL: We found [the phone] engaged.\r\n\r\nPAUL: Found engaged?\r\n\r\nNEIL: [inaudible] —they have it off the hook. \r\n\r\nPAUL: Mm.\r\n\r\nRINGO: Send him a telegram.\r\n\r\nLINDA: Tell him [Paul]’s on pins and needles, wondering what’s happened to him. [Paul laughs bleakly] Yeah, I thought of that last night, sending him a telegram.\r\n\r\nMICHAEL: Did anybody speak to him last night? Does that—\r\n\r\nNEIL: No, it was the same last night.\r\n\r\nMICHAEL: Maybe if [Yoko] stayed in the black bag, that would count as— [inaudible; drowned out by voice marking tape slate] But not talking. [laughs] Putting that lid on the parrot’s cage. [long pause; Paul whistling; Michael sighing]\r\n\r\nPAUL: … And then there were two. [laughs]\r\n\r\n### Notes\r\n\r\nShows the mix of black humour and genuine anxiety as they contemplate John possibly following George’s example and “going on strike.”\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 6\r\n\r\n### Overview\r\n\r\nJanuary 13th, 1969: Paul and Neil discuss John and Yoko’s inseparability and how it affects one-on-one communication. Paul recalls a failed attempt to write ‘I Will’ with John and Yoko present; he insists Yoko tried not to interfere, but her presence still changed his behaviour. He maintains it’s not their place to tell John how to live with Yoko.\r\n\r\n### Dialogue\r\n\r\nLINDA: I don’t know, but that’s what I—\r\n\r\nNEIL: Yes, I think a lot of people get to have the impression that whenever John talks these days, it’s like, oh – Yoko’s talking to [for] him.\r\n\r\nPAUL: Yeah. \r\n\r\nNEIL: Or he shuts up, and that’s it, he doesn’t do it for you. And then that becomes a dream. [inaudible]\r\n\r\nPAUL: Sure. \r\n\r\nNEIL: Not ever, like, talking to him – like I’m talking to you now. Like now I’m talking to Paul, I’m not talking to Linda. \r\n\r\nPAUL: Right. \r\n\r\nNEIL: But when you’re talking to John, you always – these days, anyway – tend to think that you’re talking to Yoko more than you’re talking to John. And that’s when it becomes a drag. \r\n\r\nPAUL: [furtive] That’s why I say writing a song with him is a bit embarrassing, because I do think it sort of – I mean, I start examining my motives, with Yoko there… And it’s probably silly of me! It’s probably silly, because like, Yoko’s not what we’re all sort of thinking she is. \r\n\r\nNEIL: You see, I wouldn’t mind if she would just… wouldn’t say as much. Otherwise.\r\n\r\nPAUL: [weary] Well, that – of course that would be great, you know.\r\n\r\nNEIL: [laughs; bleak] Yeah. ‘Cause I just feel that it’s like – it’s you and John that are writing the songs together. You know, I mean, I’m not, I’m not— [inaudible; Linda’s and Ringo’s voices]\r\n\r\nPAUL: Yeah. \r\n\r\nNEIL: It’s just like, that – she’d start interjecting that you’d… hurt him, and—\r\n\r\nPAUL: Yeah, no, she would—\r\n\r\nNEIL: But you know, she probably wouldn’t—\r\n\r\nPAUL: No, she isn’t—\r\n\r\nNEIL: But that’s – you know.\r\n\r\nPAUL: Yeah, see, that’s the thing. The only one time we’ve actually done it, she’s agreed. She really is alright. It’s like, it’s the thought of her being there when some of—  [faltering] And then you don’t talk to John, so then he doesn’t talk to you, you know. And it’s like, you can screw it up just as much because she’s there, as – as John’s relying on her because she’s there. So that’s the thing. You know, but I mean, like, you’ll notice, if John – if you’re onto a beam with John about something, then he really isn’t, you know, he really won’t let Yoko talk about it. Because he knows when you’re on a beam, and he knows about it, and you’ll – you can talk straighter to him.\r\n\r\nBut it’s like, we did ‘I Will’. We tried, we were trying to get the last verse to ‘I Will’, and eventually I just ended up doing it, because it – we couldn’t actually do it. [pause; trying] But – I mean, Yoko really tried to stay out of it, [and] just sort of – got on with something, but she just really… you know. They’re onto that thing. They just want to be near to each other. So I just think it’s just silly of me, or of anyone, to try and say to him, “No, you can’t,” you know. It’s like, ‘cause – okay, they’re – they’re going overboard about it, but John always does! And Yoko probably always does. So that’s their scene. You can’t go saying – you know, “Don’t go overboard about this thing. Be sensible about it. Don’t bring it to meetings.” It’s his decision, that. It’s – it’s none of our business, to start interfering in that. Even when it comes into our business, you still can’t really say much, unless – except, “Look, I don’t like it, John.” And then he can say, well, “Screw you,” or, “I like it,” or, “Well, I won’t do it so much,” or blablabla. Like, that’s the only way, you know. To tell John about that. \r\n\r\nMICHAEL: Have you done that already? \r\n\r\nPAUL: Well, I told him I didn’t like writing songs… with him and Yoko. \r\n\r\nMICHAEL: Were you writing much more before she came around—?\r\n\r\nPAUL: Oh yeah, sure. \r\n\r\nMICHAEL: Or had you – cooled it a bit, then? Before her.\r\n\r\nRINGO: Before Yoko got there.\r\n\r\nPAUL: [restrained] Yeah, cooled it, cooled it. Sure. We’d cooled it because… not playing together. Ever since we didn’t play together—\r\n\r\nMICHAEL: Onstage, you mean. \r\n\r\nPAUL: Yes. With the band. Because we lived together, and we played together. We were in the same hotel, up at the same time every morning, doing this all day. And this – I mean, this, you know, it doesn’t matter what you do, [but] just as long as you’re this close all day, something grows, you know. In some ways. And when you’re not this close, only, just physically… something goes. \r\n\r\nMICHAEL: Right.\r\n\r\nPAUL: So then you can come together to record, and stuff, but you still sort of lose the… [hesitating] Actually, musically, you know, we really – we can play better than we’ve ever been able to play, you know. Like, I really think that. I think, like – [laughs; bleak] we’re – we’re alright on that. It’s just that – being together thing, you know. \r\n\r\n### Notes\r\n\r\n(Your long note about “projections abound” and Yoko as a mirror for Paul’s feelings goes here.)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 7\r\n\r\n### Overview\r\n\r\nJanuary 13th, 1969: As everyone waits for John and Yoko to arrive, Paul talks disconsolately about John’s evasiveness and how using Yoko as his mouthpiece drove George to walk out of the previous day’s band meeting. Linda, Neil, and Michael add their perspectives.\r\n\r\n### Dialogue\r\n\r\nMICHAEL: But do you think if you put any, uh, pressure on him, that he’d – go your way a bit more?\r\n\r\nPAUL: [guarded] Who’s this?\r\n\r\nMICHAEL: John.\r\n\r\nPAUL: I don’t know. [long pause] But I don’t know, you know, I can’t… [quiet] I just can’t be bothered doing all that.\r\n\r\nMICHAEL: Hm. [awkward] Hm. [silence; fidgeting]\r\n\r\nPAUL: [tired] Do you want to try and ring John? [long pause]\r\n\r\nNEIL: Mal or I can do it.\r\n\r\nPAUL: Try him.\r\n\r\nLINDA: The thing is, the four of you. The four of them just talking. \r\n\r\nMICHAEL: Did you – did you not talk about it much, last night?\r\n\r\nLINDA: Well, there was just too many…\r\n\r\nNEIL: People.\r\n\r\nLINDA: Mm.\r\n\r\nPAUL: John didn’t talk. You see, Yoko talked… for John.\r\n\r\nMICHAEL: Did George stay?\r\n\r\nPAUL: Oh, well, then – in the middle of all that, actually—\r\n\r\nLINDA: Hopefully.\r\n\r\nPAUL: George went. You know, “See ya.”\r\n\r\nLINDA: But he was waiting for it to stop, you know. That’s why he was stepping out. But when he saw it wasn’t… The thing is like – a meeting without Yoko, just once, and she’d—\r\n\r\nNEIL: I don’t think we’ll ever get that. [long pause]\r\n\r\nPAUL: You see, that’s it, you know.\r\n\r\nNEIL: That is.\r\n\r\nPAUL: That is a big sort of crunch, that.\r\n\r\nNEIL: You’d have to – you’d have to say it to John, then. And then it’s going to be like, “Well, I’m not doing it,” or, “I am doing it,” and whichever way it goes – but at least whenever John decides what he wants with that, that will be that.\r\n\r\n### Notes\r\n\r\nRaises the impossibility of a “Beatles-only” meeting without Yoko, and frames it as a key “crunch” point.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 8\r\n\r\n### Overview\r\n\r\nJanuary 13th, 1969 (Lunchtime): Over lunch, they return to George’s resignation and the failed band meeting. Yoko claims George can be “got back easily,” John calls the issue a “festering wound,” and Paul admits he doesn’t like to be “smothered.”\r\n\r\n### Dialogue\r\n\r\nPAUL: [bleak; joking] So where’s George?\r\n\r\nRINGO: It smells like George is here. \r\n\r\nYOKO: [to John] Well, you can get back George so easily, you know that. You know, Paul and—\r\n\r\nJOHN: But it’s not that easy, because it’s a festering wound—\r\n\r\nPAUL: Yeah. \r\n\r\nLINDA: Yeah. \r\n\r\nJOHN: —that we’ve allowed to – and yesterday we allowed it go even deeper, but we didn’t give him any bandages. And it’s only because George, uh, when he comes up, when he is that part of him… We have egos. We can’t help but have—\r\n\r\nRINGO: Well, it can be a burden on him. \r\n\r\nJOHN: I’ll have, you know—well, look, you do— [inaudible]\r\n\r\nRINGO: [inaudible]\r\n\r\nPAUL: Rosé.\r\n\r\nYOKO: Can I have one too [inaudible]? But if you wanted it badly enough, you have to, you know—\r\n\r\nMAL: What do you want, uh, Paul?\r\n\r\nPAUL: Rosé, please, for me. Linda?\r\n\r\nLINDA: No thank you.\r\n\r\nJOHN: [inaudible] I wouldn’t say it’s my ego. It was yesterday, really – or, or even the day before when we went to George’s—\r\n\r\nPAUL: I sure as hell know I wouldn’t like you to.\r\n\r\nJOHN: What?\r\n\r\nPAUL: Dig in your heels.\r\n\r\nYOKO: Your ego’s great, by the way. \r\n\r\nPAUL: ’Cause if I’m to – if I’m to look at either of you, you know, I really don’t like to be smothered. You know—\r\n\r\nYOKO: No, no no—\r\n\r\nPAUL: You know, if I could – if you were in a shop on a shelf, I’d— [inaudible] —or whatever it is—\r\n\r\nJOHN: I’m just trying to ask [inaudible] – do I want him back, Paul, I’m just asking, do I want it back? Whatever it is.\r\n\r\n### Notes\r\n\r\nBegins to pivot from George’s hurt to John’s question of what he himself wants “back.”\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 9\r\n\r\n### Overview\r\n\r\nJanuary 13th, 1969: As George’s resignation is discussed, John explicitly asks Paul whether he actually wants George (and whatever the Beatles are) “back,” and if so, at what emotional price.\r\n\r\n### Dialogue\r\n\r\nJOHN: I’m just trying to ask [inaudible] – do I want him back, Paul, I’m just asking, do I want it back? Whatever it is. [Do I want it back] Enough?\r\n\r\nYOKO: Right, do you want this, to have George back, you have [inaudible]—\r\n\r\nJOHN: Then if it is enough, I’d have to swallow my ego for you, I’d have to smother me jealousy for you—\r\n\r\nPAUL: Mm. \r\n\r\nJOHN: —to carry on for whatever reasons there is. \r\n\r\n### Notes\r\n\r\nOne of John’s clearest statements that continuing as Beatles would require him to “swallow [his] ego” and jealousy.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 10\r\n\r\n### Overview\r\n\r\nJanuary 13th, 1969: John reflects on how his partnership with Paul and his relationship with Yoko have hurt George and contributed to his walkout. The conversation is emotionally and interpretively complex, touching on adjustment, guilt, and self-preservation.\r\n\r\n### Dialogue\r\n\r\nJOHN: And it’s just that, you know. It’s only this year that you’ve suddenly realised, like who I am, or who he is, or anything like that. But the thing is—\r\n\r\nPAUL: But I still haven’t realised that. What I’m – the process.\r\n\r\nYOKO: [inaudible]\r\n\r\nJOHN: Yeah yeah, but you realise that some – like you were saying, like George was some other part. But up till then, you’d had a – your thing that carried you forward. [pause; Yoko speaking?] I know, I’d adjusted before you. Alright, that would make me hipper than you, but I know that I’d adjusted to you before that – for selfish reasons, and for good reasons, not knowing what else to do, and for all these reasons. I’d adjusted to all these and allowed you [inaudible] – you know, if you wanted to let me— [inaudible] —very, very… whatever it is. But this year, you’ve seen, you’ve seen what you’ve been doing, and what everybody’s been doing, and not only did we feel guilty about it, the way we all feel guilty about our relationship to each other, because we could do more… \r\n\r\nYOKO: [inaudible]\r\n\r\nJOHN: I know, the thing is that I’m – I can’t – I’m not putting any blame on you for only suddenly realising it, see, because it’s [inaudible] our game, you know; it might have been masochistic, but the goal was still the same, self-preservation. And I knew what I liked about that. I know where the – even if I didn’t know where I was at, you know, the table’s there, and… let him do what he wants, and George too, you know…\r\n\r\nPAUL: I know. I know—\r\n\r\nJOHN: And I have won.\r\n\r\nPAUL: But this thing has been—\r\n\r\nJOHN: But I think you—\r\n\r\nPAUL: You have—\r\n\r\nJOHN: I feel it’s you.\r\n\r\nPAUL: Whatever it is, you have. Yeah, I know. Well, I’ve had [inaudible]—\r\n\r\nJOHN: Because you – ’cause you’ve suddenly got it all, you see.\r\n\r\nPAUL: Mm.\r\n\r\nJOHN: I know that, because of the way I am, like when we were in Mendips, like I said, “Do you like me?” or whatever it is. I’ve always – uh, played that one.\r\n\r\nPAUL: [laughs nervously] Yes.\r\n\r\nJOHN: So.\r\n\r\nPAUL: Uh, I’d been watching, I’d been watching. I’d been watching the picture.\r\n\r\nYOKO: Go back to George. What are we going to do about George?\r\n\r\nJOHN: Yeah, I’m – yeah, sure. But this year, suddenly, it’s all happened to you, and you sort of go – you’re taking the blame, suddenly, as if, uh… Oh, he’d say, “Oh yeah, you know [inaudible],” as if I’ve never known it. And then he thought, “Fucking hell. I know what he’s like. I know he used to kick people. I know how he connived with Len, Ivan. I know him, you know? Fuck him.” And then, oh, but, but right, I’ve done such things… all that. So you’ve taken the five years that [inaudible], you’ve taken the five years of trouble, this year. So half of me says, alright, you know I’ll do anything to save you, to help you. And the other half of me says, well serves him fucking right. I’ve chewed through fucking shit because of him for five years, and he’s only just realised what he was doing [to her?]. So, and that’s something – we’ve both known it, you know? [laughs] And it is incredible. [pause]\r\n\r\nPAUL: Yeah.\r\n\r\n### Notes\r\n\r\nHighly ambiguous as to who is “you” and “he” at various points; functionally a Rorschach for the reader.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 11\r\n\r\n### Overview\r\n\r\nJanuary 13th, 1969: John likens replacing George to when Ringo replaced Pete Best, and claims “The Beatles” are not limited to the four of them—he and Paul could each be “a Beatle” alone. Paul counters by describing John as “front of the chute” and George on the third rung, with Ringo joking that he’s been “the cabbage.”\r\n\r\n### Dialogue\r\n\r\nPAUL: See, I’m just assuming he’s coming back, you know. I tell you, I’m just assuming he’s coming back.\r\n\r\nRINGO: If he wants—\r\n\r\nJOHN: What if he isn’t?\r\n\r\nPAUL: If he isn’t, then… if he isn’t, then it’s a new problem.\r\n\r\nRINGO: He would like the four of us to sit down.\r\n\r\nJOHN: It’s like we’ve said—\r\n\r\nPAUL: Yeah.\r\n\r\nRINGO: He wants the four of us to actually—\r\n\r\nJOHN: See, if we want it – if we do want it, I still won’t tour, man, but I do want to—\r\n\r\nPAUL: But you seem to – you seem to think—\r\n\r\nJOHN: But if we do end up deciding we want it, as a policy, I can go along with that. Because the policy has kept us together.\r\n\r\nRINGO: But the thing is that if we want him—\r\n\r\nJOHN: If we want him, because we want him – but the thing is, like George said, it’s that The Beatles, to me, isn’t just limited to the four of us. I think that I, alone, could be a Beatle. [to Paul] I think you could. [to Ringo] I’m not sure whether you could, because you’re doing… Well, like, but I’m just telling you what I think! I don’t think The Beatles revolve around the four people! It might be like a job—\r\n\r\nPAUL: But you know what, John, I’ll tell you one thing—\r\n\r\nJOHN: [to Ringo] It’s like you joining the band instead of Pete. It’s like – to me, it is like that.\r\n\r\nPAUL: Tell you what— [inaudible] Let me tell you what I think. [pause; inaudible] —thing is this. [to John] You have always been at the front of the chute. Now, there have been some secondary rungs, but George has been third rung—\r\n\r\nRINGO: And I’ve been the cabbage.\r\n\r\nPAUL: [immediately] Never.\r\n\r\nJOHN: [dismissive] No, we haven’t—\r\n\r\nPAUL: No, just, no – listen here. You’re the rabbit, he’s right.\r\n\r\nJOHN: But not always, though—\r\n\r\nPAUL: [anxious] No, listen here – listen – always! But! But! [pause] I do think – no, I do think that as grim as it all is, that [George]’s right. And I do think that like our sole approach is exactly what he’s been saying. And that our brains sort of… con him. It’s all nothing. I do think that is a – I mean— [stumbling] As a first way out, I can’t really even say that, but I do think, you know, that when you get right down to it—\r\n\r\nJOHN: Yes.\r\n\r\nPAUL: ’Cause the moments of clarity, that I’ve just been – are just so innocent, and so simple, that all my connive, and all my – urge, or— [inaudible]\r\n\r\nJOHN: But don’t give me like – ’cause I’ve at least been aware of my conniving since fourteen. Real aware of it.\r\n\r\nPAUL: Sure.\r\n\r\nJOHN: And before that. You realize that I’ve known I’ve been conniving from – from Dovedale, you know that. I’ve been aware of that. Just because – I don’t know whether it’s him. It’s not him. It’s just me. That I’ve realized where it’s nowhere – but the thing is, I only know where it is when I’m in the middle of all of it—\r\n\r\nPAUL: Yeah.\r\n\r\nJOHN: —that I am sort of at it again. And that’s why I’ve had to fight for the last three years. And I’ve done it – the other way. Just – rather than allow myself to connive, I thought, “Stop it now. Stop it.”\r\n\r\n### Notes\r\n\r\nJohn frames his manipulativeness as something he’s long been aware of and has consciously tried to curb.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 12\r\n\r\n### Overview\r\n\r\nJanuary 13th, 1969: In the midst of this fraught conversation, Paul tells John and Ringo that he “wants them for whatever they are,” placing “all the money, all the fame” on who they are as people rather than on what they do.\r\n\r\n### Dialogue\r\n\r\nPAUL: [trying] If all of you were for sale on a shop, I’d want you as, you know, that, but I really don’t want you as that!\r\n\r\nJOHN: Yes.\r\n\r\nPAUL: But I want you as that! I don’t want him as that. You see, I want you to want yours. You’re [inaudible]. Ringo wanted— When I say those things, you know, I can hear myself sort of – but I don’t know what it is you want me to do! In period and in fact, I want you all for whatever you are. Because I’m placing it – after all the bests, and all it bloody does, and what’s best, is that what you are is alright. Because if it isn’t, then it’s just stupid of me [inaudible], you know? Because it’s what you are, and I would [inaudible] anywhere! So I’m placing all the money, all the fame, and everything, on what you are. So if this is what you two are, then get on with it.\r\n\r\n### Notes\r\n\r\nOne of Paul’s most explicit declarations of unconditional commitment to John and Ringo as people rather than as “Beatles.”\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 13\r\n\r\n### Overview\r\n\r\nJanuary 13th, 1969: Linda talks to John about the difficulty of relationships (including musical ones) and argues that making good music together is reason enough to keep working. John, however, laments that the White Album doesn’t feel like a truly satisfying Beatles collaboration, even if individual tracks are strong.\r\n\r\n### Dialogue\r\n\r\nLINDA: You were saying that—\r\n\r\nJOHN: [pained] It’s like George said. It just doesn’t give me the same sort of satisfaction anymore. Because of the compromise we’d have to make, to be together. [long pause] You know, it’s that the end result of the records now aren’t… enough. Because now, we – we know it so clearly, how we arrived at it, and for what it was and all. Before, it was always a surprise when we – you know. We weren’t so aware of how we reacted to it. When the – something came out, like Revolver or Pepper or whatever, there was still that element of surprise that we didn’t know where it came from. But now we know exactly where it came from, and how we arrived at that particular noise, and how it could have been… much better. Or it needn’t have been at all. The only way to do it – satisfactory, for y– yourself – is to do it on your own. And then that’s fucking hard.\r\n\r\nLINDA: But you were saying yesterday, you know. And you know something, you – you’ve always been sort of thinking that it can’t be any better than it was; you’re not just a studio musician. You always say it. I mean, [inaudible] – I’m saying, hey, you make good music together. And you like it or not, you know.\r\n\r\nJOHN: [furtive] I like it.\r\n\r\nLINDA: And making good music is also—\r\n\r\nJOHN: But it’s just—\r\n\r\nLINDA: It’s really hard working at a relationship.\r\n\r\nJOHN: I – I know.\r\n\r\nLINDA: Of course! That’s what you said yesterday. It happens all the time, you know. And you also said you wanted [inaudible] The Beatles—\r\n\r\nJOHN: It’s like all of us are dissatisfied with The Beatles LP. Now, it’s not because the way we got on doing it, because the end result was – was as good as it could’ve been. And – I don’t know what the reason could be. [offhand] Mal, could you get a little glass of wine?\r\n\r\nMAL: Yeah. Red, or—?\r\n\r\nJOHN: If I get down to my contributions, then I’m satisfied, you know. But the whole thing is less satisfactory.\r\n\r\nRINGO: But I enjoy it more.\r\n\r\nJOHN: But individually. Name any of them! There is no [inaudible]. Even George’s numbers are more satisfactory than any numbers we’ve done before. But as a whole thing, it’s just not satisfactory to me.\r\n\r\nRINGO: Well, I mean, I dig it far more than Sgt. Pepper or anything—\r\n\r\nLINDA: You know, it really—\r\n\r\nJOHN: And I dig it too. I dig it, individually, far more than Sgt. Pepper. But as a whole – as a Beatles thing, I think it didn’t – it couldn’t work as a Beatles thing. I think it’s one of the best Beatles work we could have, you know, but as a – as an entity, as a whole coming out of all of us here – no.\r\n\r\n### Notes\r\n\r\nAn important statement of John’s dissatisfaction with the White Album as a “Beatles thing” even while valuing its individual songs.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 14\r\n\r\n### Overview\r\n\r\nJanuary 13th, 1969: Paul encourages a hesitant Ringo about making a solo LP, and John opens up about being unsure “whether to go left or right.” Paul and John use a telephone-box-kicking metaphor to talk about intentions, actions, and fear of looking foolish.\r\n\r\n### Dialogue\r\n\r\nPAUL: [to Ringo] The great thing is that you singing like how you really sing – will be it. It will be! \r\n\r\nRINGO: Yes, but the only way is to do it on your own. \r\n\r\nPAUL: Until then – yeah, sure. Until then – until you reach how you really sing, you’ll sing your half-soul. \r\n\r\nRINGO: Yeah. \r\n\r\nPAUL: And it’s probably when we’re all very old, that we’ll all sing together. \r\n\r\nRINGO: Yeah.\r\n\r\nPAUL: And we’ll all really sing, and we’ll all show each other how good we are, and in fact we’ll die, then, I don’t know. [Linda laughs; diffident] Probably, you know, probably something sappy or soft like that… I don’t know, but really, I mean, i– it’s really down to all those sort of simple, silly things to me. \r\n\r\nYOKO: But those are the important things, you know. \r\n\r\nPAUL: It’s got to be simple. It’s got to be simple. It can’t be A plus B equals X plus Y plus Z, because that’s them, you know. And it couldn’t be— \r\n\r\nJOHN: [quiet] Maybe that’s what’s evading me. \r\n\r\nPAUL: Yes. [sincere] But it’s okay, that, you know. \r\n\r\nJOHN: [hesitating] I just, uh… because I’m not really sure what or how I feel about it. \r\n\r\nPAUL: No, but you’re—\r\n\r\nJOHN: Because any time— \r\n\r\nPAUL: You’re unsure because you’re not sure whether to go left or right on an issue. You’ve noticed the two ways open to us. You know the way we all want to go. And you know the way you want to go. Which is positive! ‘Cause you want to go – now, okay. So your positive thing might actually be to kick that telephone box in. It might occasionally be to do that. So you know that’s the way you’ve gotta go.  \r\n\r\nYOKO: Everybody would want to see that, actually.\r\n\r\nPAUL: But you don’t want to actually look like you’re kicking the telephone box in. So you have to sort of say to everyone, “Look at that over there, everyone!” And while they’re not looking, you’ll kick the telephone box in, and sort of— [whistles innocently] \r\n\r\nJOHN: I don’t think that’s a fair representation. [laughs] \r\n\r\nPAUL: [conceding] Oh, well, it involves me, that’s me. I do that, too. And I think we all do that. But I think the answer is, that – while you’ve got us all looking at nothing over there, and you’ve thrown us for a minute, we would actually all have dug to see you kick that telephone box in.  Because we wanna see you do it. \r\n\r\nYOKO: But we’d have to say it too, though. That’s another thing. \r\n\r\nPAUL: We would actually want to watch the Steve McQueen film, where he kicks the telephone box in. We all want to see that. You know. And I really think that’s—\r\n\r\nYOKO: Yes, but sometimes it’s very—\r\n\r\nJOHN: But it must be our own faults, that we’ve built it up that I can’t kick the telephone box – apart from it being my fault— \r\n\r\nPAUL: You can. You could. \r\n\r\nJOHN: But – the feeling that, that – that I – like Ringo said about his album, that what – we’re – you know. I won’t do it, ‘cause I’m gonna let us down, or – look a fool. \r\n\r\nPAUL: Yeah.\r\n\r\nJOHN: You know, and we’ve each done that to each— [audio glitch] That bit. \r\n\r\nPAUL: We all know we can do that, you know. I mean, I’m really trying to sort of learn, really— [inaudible] —meaning.\r\n\r\nJOHN: Well, it’s like – we’ve all found – we can do it on our own. \r\n\r\nPAUL: But on our own, I’m just gonna have to sort of just say it to you all. Through the song. Now I know if I – when I’m saying to you all, “Listen, this is how this song goes,” you know, then I know if I half-tell you how it goes, that there’ll be two of you who’ll like it, and then there’s only [inaudible]. You know. \r\n\r\nJOHN: Yeah. \r\n\r\nPAUL: A certain amount of you will like it, and some of you won’t. Because, and I know – and you know, this is where it gets heavy. Because you’ve got to blame yourself, for that. Because I know I half-sang it. \r\n\r\nJOHN: Yes. \r\n\r\nPAUL: And I know that if – say I’m pissed, at the end of an evening, and I just, and I get on a piano because I really just want to get on a piano. And I’m singing because I don’t particularly want to show off, too. I want to really sing this song, now, and say what I wanna say, and so on and so on and so on. I’ll do it, and everyone in that room will dig it, because it’s me really doing it. And I know that we all have this. [inaudible] And everyone will be really crazy about it. Now if I were really doing it, everyone will listen, and everyone will dig it, and no one will go against it. It’s when I half-mean it, or it’s when I nearly mean it, but there’s – there’s always that one person that can spot that – that—\r\n\r\nJOHN: Yeah.\r\n\r\nPAUL: Spot them doing a mistake. You know, there’s always someone who can spot that little bit where Charlie Chester didn’t quite mean it, or Charlie Drake, when he didn’t quite mean the joke. You know, it’s all in that.\r\n\r\nYOKO: But then sometimes it doesn’t matter to you, so. \r\n\r\nPAUL: It’s like if we could really… See, that’s why I think this is where we’ve got a problem now, you know.\r\n\r\n### Notes\r\n\r\n(Your note about this being a “hilariously sad” mutual test of commitment fits here.)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 15\r\n\r\n### Overview\r\n\r\nJanuary 13th, 1969: John and Paul talk about their songwriting partnership, expectations, and how each has influenced George. John stresses that he has rarely told Paul what to sing or play, and that his only regret is letting songs be taken somewhere he didn’t want them to go.\r\n\r\n### Dialogue\r\n\r\nPAUL: That’s why I think this – we’ve got this problem now, you know. What I’d like to do, is for the four of us – and you know, we’ve all have done [inaudible] things – to different degrees, I see it as you go one way, you go one way, George goes one way, and me another. But I know it will apply to all us, if one day, we can all be singing like we’re singing, [to Ringo] you can be drumming like you’re drumming, George can be really playing – I mean, like he plays, not as if I’m trying to make him play like me. But now it’s like I keep trying to make him play like – how I’ve played guitar—\r\n\r\nJOHN: But you don’t, you see. The point – the point that we both – or, mainly me—\r\n\r\nPAUL: Back up, back up.\r\n\r\nJOHN: Yeah, okay. Is that you try and make George play… competently, because you’re afraid that how he’ll play won’t be like you want him to play. And that’s what we did. And that’s what you did to me. [pause]\r\n\r\nPAUL: Yeah.\r\n\r\nJOHN: And – I – that’s the difference with you saying that the competen— [audio glitch] —so annoyed by the conniving on The Beatles album, was that I’d—\r\n\r\nPAUL: Yeah.\r\n\r\nJOHN: I got to a bit where I thought – it’s no good, me telling you what or how to do it, you know? All I tried to do on that album was just sing it to you like I was drunk, you know.\r\n\r\nPAUL: Yeah.\r\n\r\nJOHN: Just did me best to say, “Look, this, this stands up on its own.”\r\n\r\nPAUL: Yeah.\r\n\r\nJOHN: And I’m not doing this quite well, ‘cause I – like even with ‘Don’t Let Me Down’, the first time I sang it. Because I hadn’t allowed meself to say it, as a whole song.\r\n\r\nPAUL: Yeah.\r\n\r\nJOHN: I couldn’t work – it was only after we’d done it that I’d realised  it was done. You know, and on The Beatles album, I just sort of said, “[inaudible] This is me singing it drunk, but I’m pretending as if I’m not. What would you do with it?”\r\n\r\nPAUL: [laughs] Drunk.\r\n\r\nJOHN: You know? “George, you play whatever you like.”\r\n\r\nPAUL: Yeah.\r\n\r\nJOHN: You know, and that’s what it was. It wasn’t – it wasn’t the arrogance of, “Listen. This is it, baby.” It was that – I can’t tell you what to do because you won’t play, here, like how I think you should play.\r\n\r\nPAUL: Yeah, right.\r\n\r\nJOHN: And—\r\n\r\nPAUL: You see, that’s – that’s the thing.\r\n\r\nJOHN: I’m not going to tell you what to play—\r\n\r\nPAUL: That seems to be the trouble, is that—\r\n\r\nYOKO: It is. [pause]\r\n\r\nPAUL: Okay. And that’s great, you know. And then – it’s just that being able to say that, on the occasion. I just mean to say, “Look, I’m not going to say anything about the song, because – really, I’m going to really try, now—”\r\n\r\nJOHN: But we tried it—\r\n\r\nPAUL: “—to sing it to you—”\r\n\r\nJOHN: [exasperated] Yeah, I know, but you wouldn’t say—\r\n\r\nPAUL: Listen to me— [inaudible]\r\n\r\nJOHN: We arranged it, you know?\r\n\r\nPAUL: I know, I know.\r\n\r\nJOHN: You can’t see— Listen, uh, you— [inaudible]\r\n\r\nPAUL: I say that, of course, when [inaudible] when you say that to me, because I haven’t got it off of you.\r\n\r\nJOHN: Yeah, but the point is you—\r\n\r\nPAUL: And you’ve sort of – I think—\r\n\r\nJOHN: Well, I’m saying that ‘Dear Prudence’ is arranged. Can’t you hear bom, bom, bom, bom, bom…?\r\n\r\nPAUL: Yeah.\r\n\r\nJOHN: That – that is the arrangement, you know.\r\n\r\nPAUL: Yeah, well.\r\n\r\nJOHN: But I’m too frightened to say “This is it,” I just sit there and say, “Look, if you don’t come along, and play your bit, I won’t do the song,” you know? I can’t do any better than that. Don’t ask me for what boogie you’re gonna play on it.\r\n\r\nPAUL: Yeah.\r\n\r\nJOHN: Because… apart from not knowing, I can’t tell you better than you have, what grooves you can  play on it. You know, I just can’t work. I can’t do it like that. ‘Course I could, you know! But when you think of the other half of it, just think: how much more have I done towards helping you write? I’ve never told you what to sing, or what to play.\r\n\r\nPAUL: Yeah.\r\n\r\nJOHN: You know, I’ve always done the numbers like that. Now, the only regret, just for the past numbers, is when – because I’ve been so frightened, that I’ve allowed you to take it somewhere where I didn’t want—\r\n\r\nPAUL: Yeah.\r\n\r\nJOHN: —and then – my only chance was to let George [audio glitch] take over, or interest George in it, because I knew he’d—\r\n\r\nPAUL: Like ‘She Said, She Said’?\r\n\r\nLINDA: Yes, yes.\r\n\r\nJOHN: ‘She Said, She Said’. Then he’d – he’d– ’cause he’d take it as is. You know? [inaudible; drowned out by voice marking] So on that last album— [inaudible] —arrangements on it— [inaudible] —it’s probably George, you know. If there’s anything wrong with it. Because I don’t want your arrangement on it. I only want your… If you give me your suggestions, let me reject them, or in the case there’s one I like – it’s when we’re writing songs.\r\n\r\nPAUL: Mm.\r\n\r\nJOHN: The same goes for the arrangement. I don’t want it – to… [sighs] I don’t know.\r\n\r\nPAUL: No, I know. I know what you mean, yeah.\r\n\r\nYOKO: I know exactly what you mean.\r\n\r\nPAUL: Yeah, yeah—\r\n\r\nJOHN: I want it to be like I’m just doing it, but— [audio cuts off]\r\n\r\n### Notes\r\n\r\nJohn positions himself as someone who rarely directs Paul, even while acknowledging he’s sometimes ceded songs to George to avoid Paul’s arrangements.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 16\r\n\r\n### Overview\r\n\r\nJanuary 13th, 1969 (Twickenham Studios, London): John explains that he’s effectively ceded arrangement decisions on Beatles tracks to Paul, because he only really hears the basic band and George Martin’s orchestrations. Paul responds that all four of them share similar issues, and that at times none of them could criticize Paul without being rejected, which in turn led to them giving minimal input.\r\n\r\n### Dialogue\r\n\r\nJOHN: And that’s all I did on the last album was say, “Okay, Paul, you’re out to decide where my songs are concerned, arrangement-wise.” [exasperated] I don’t know the songs, you know. I’d sooner just sing them, than have them turn into – into ‘Mr. Kite’, or anything else, where— I’ve accepted the problem from you that it needs arrangement. And then, because I’m an ape, I don’t know. I don’t see any further than me, the guitar, and the drums, and – and George Martin doing the— [audio glitch] I don’t hear any of the flutes playing, you know? I suppose I could hear ‘em if I sat down and worked very hard! I could turn out a mathematical drawing if you’d like, but I could never do it off me own backside, I always have to just – [brushing sound from strumming motion] do that, you know?\r\n\r\nPAUL: Yeah. \r\n\r\nJOHN: I mean— \r\n\r\nPAUL: [quiet] Yeah. Yeah. [pause] I’m onto the same thing, you know. That’s – that’s – we’re all at that. It is only, like, if you can just remember that we’re – you know. That the four of us are trying to do that. Because I mean, all of those things you say, you know, in some way, apply to me. Not all ways—\r\n\r\nJOHN: Yes, yes, because everything applies a little bit to you, too.\r\n\r\nPAUL: [inaudible] —it is just you saying it. They’re all – you know, in some way, to some degree, will apply to me. \r\n\r\nJOHN: ‘Cause once there was a period where none of us could actually, uh, say anything, about your criticisms. \r\n\r\nPAUL: [quiet] Yeah. Yeah.\r\n\r\nJOHN: [bleak] ‘Cause you would reject it all.\r\n\r\nPAUL: [quiet] Yeah, sure. \r\n\r\nJOHN: And so George and I would just go – you know, “I’ll give you a line here,” “Okay,” you know, “We’ll do four in a bar, and I’ll do…” And a lot of the times you were right.\r\n\r\nPAUL: Yeah. \r\n\r\nJOHN: But a lot of the times you were – [the songs were] the same as they always are. But I can’t see the answer to that.\r\n\r\nPAUL: No, but – no, that’s good you see. The thing is, like, within each other, within ourselves, we reach something that’s nearly perfect. And everyone else who’s listening will think, “That’s it. They’ve got it.” You know – you know what I mean. So okay, we know we nearly made it, but we’ve really made it, for everyone else. ‘Cause it’s okay, we’re into the fine, finest, finest technicalities – I mean, that’s where it’s at, you know. If one day, we can even keep all – if all the people who are listening to this, nearly nearly made it, they’ll think we’ve made it, you know. They’ll think that’s it. So okay, if we can nearly, if we can creep up on it – and that’s, see, that’s what I’m trying to do. Like last week, yesterday [inaudible] doing alright for me, I was really trying to just say to George, “Take it there,” you know, whereas I wouldn’t have gone [inaudible] and said, “Take it there – with diddle-a-diddle-a-da.” But I was trying last week, to say, “Now, take it over there, and it needs to be like – but, oh, what, like, whatever you—”\r\n\r\nJOHN: You see, the point is now – George – is we both did that to George, this time.\r\n\r\nPAUL: Mm.\r\n\r\nJOHN: And because of the build up to it, that – now he can’t even take that. \r\n\r\nPAUL: Treating him a bit like a mongrel, yeah. \r\n\r\nJOHN: He can’t even – you know. [audio glitch] It’s like if I say, “Alright, take it,” he’ll say, “Well, look, I can’t take it.

Neil reassures Paul and Ringo that George still cares about the band, and only wants to settle everything equally and honestly amongst the four of them, without any outsiders.</p>\n<p>Amidst everyone’s comments about Yoko’s over-involvement (ergo John’s recalcitrance), Paul admits that the protective seal the band formed around themselves over the years has made it difficult for them to regard anyone unfamiliar into their faction without some measure of hostility and paranoia – especially if they have been asserted into a creative and professional position equal to their own, as Yoko has by John.</p>\n<h3 id=\"dialogue\">Dialogue</h3>\n<p>PAUL: Waiting for you, ooh… Why don’t you know… what it could be…</p>\n<p>LINDA: It’s a good thing if all four of you just got together – and nobody else. You know, it’s alright when we’re all just sitting around now.</p>\n<p>RINGO: Did you go last night, Neil?</p>\n<p>NEIL: Um – this is, um, just something I was talking to George about last night. And that was what he was saying, too.</p>\n<p>RINGO: What?</p>\n<p>NEIL: What he means. [About] just the four of you.</p>\n<p>LINDA: Yeah, it’s—</p>\n<p>NEIL: That’s what he means, you know. Nothing else.</p>\n<p>RINGO: Yes.</p>\n<p>PAUL: Yeah, I’m for that, you know.</p>\n<p>NEIL: So am I.</p>\n<p>RINGO: Yes.</p>\n<p>LINDA: It’s the only way you’re gonna—</p>\n<p>NEIL: That’s why he didn’t – that’s why he said, “I don’t believe you,” to John. Yesterday.</p>\n<p>PAUL: Yeah… Key moment, that, wasn’t it?</p>\n<p>NEIL: [wry] Yes. But he meant it. And I think John knew what he was talking about, too.</p>\n<p>PAUL: Oh, John. [laughter] Sure he did.</p>\n<p>NEIL: And that’s why George said it twice. When John said, “I don’t understand you, George,” and George said, “I don’t believe you. Forget it.” ‘Cause he thought [John] did understand him.</p>\n<p>PAUL: [unsurprised] Of course he did.</p>\n<p>LINDA: [wry] It was great.</p>\n<p>NEIL: You know, and it’s that. It’s like the bullshitting bit where, like, that can go on, is silly.</p>\n<p>PAUL: Yeah. But I think the thing is, like, we – John does bullshit, I bullshit, Ringo bullshits, George bullshits. You know, we bullshit. The problem is that it’s only John— [inaudible; Michael Lindsay-Hogg’s voice recording a phone call] —trying to be more influencing, and they’re thinking past it. And so you start to sort of give him more credit than he’s – than he’s due for, you know. And, like, with Yoko, you know – they’re real. They mean it.</p>\n<p>LINDA: [laughs] I don’t dig that, though.</p>\n<p>PAUL: Him and Yoko, you know, they – they—</p>\n<p>LINDA: [pretends to sneeze] Go away!</p>\n<p>PAUL: You know, they do mean it. But…</p>\n<p>NEIL: [playing along] Everybody cough. Heeueck.</p>\n<p>LINDA: [playing along] Heuuuueck go away. Heeueck.</p>\n<p>PAUL: [sober] You know?</p>\n<p>LINDA: [sincere] Yeah, I know what you mean. You know what you mean.</p>\n<p>PAUL: But you know, I – I tend to think that about them, too. Like I was saying, you know. “Well, I’d rather write without Yoko, thank you.” Just because it’s – that’s the way I write. If I – like, if I was in Tunisia, I’d go up to the bathroom to write a song, and then come back when it was done to show it to you. And to sort of say, “Let’s do a couple more words, now that’s it all there, you know, now that there’s only a little…”</p>\n<p>NEIL: Yeah.</p>\n<p>PAUL: But it’s difficult starting right from scratch with Yoko there, ‘cause you start off on a – well, I do. I start off on a Yoko beam, you know. I start off sort of writing songs about white walls. [laughter] Just ‘cause I – you know, just ‘cause I think she – John and Yoko would like that. And they wouldn’t, you know. I mean, I give them too much credit for – for what I think they’d like. But that’s not true. They wouldn’t. They’re very straight. […] I mean, you know, it’s just like—</p>\n<p>LINDA: It’s all about being away from each other, aren’t they?</p>\n<p>PAUL: I think it’s—</p>\n<p>NEIL: No, I don’t – I don’t think it’s that.</p>\n<p>RINGO: Did you get in touch with John?</p>\n<p>NEIL: Um, Mal did. This morning, in fact.</p>\n<p>LINDA: That was the answering service.</p>\n<p>RINGO: [to Neil] Oh, you guys – I thought you were, later on.</p>\n<p>NEIL: I couldn’t get him.</p>\n<p>RINGO: No?</p>\n<p>MICHAEL: Is he join – is he joining us?</p>\n<p>RINGO: We don’t know.</p>\n<p>NEIL: I suppose [John and Yoko] might, but nobody can expect as much.</p>\n<p>RINGO: ‘Cause Mal couldn’t get him either, you know. He may be up now.</p>\n<p>NEIL: So – nobody’s spoken to him?</p>\n<p>RINGO: No no no. You can only get the machine. So someone should try again.</p>\n<p>NEIL: [inaudible] But nobody’s answering it.</p>\n<p>LINDA: [to Paul] Yeah, but it’s hard having a meeting, and everybody putting their two cents in and none of you all saying – anything.</p>\n<p>PAUL: But that’s the other thing, having the meeting, you know. You came with me, and Heather came, and the animal—</p>\n<p>LINDA: Yeah, I was going to say I shouldn’t go, but then…</p>\n<p>PAUL: Yeah… [lighthearted] It’s such a temptation going out to Ringo’s for the afternoon.</p>\n<p>LINDA: [laughs] Exactly.</p>\n<p>RINGO: [bemused] What?</p>\n<p>LINDA: Heather could play with Zak.</p>\n<p>PAUL: It feels like a family outing. [Ringo laughs] Don’t really just want to go on my own.</p>\n<p>LINDA: [sheepish] Yeah, I was going to say, “We really shouldn’t go,” but then I thought – well.</p>\n<p>RINGO: Why?</p>\n<p>LINDA: Well, it should’ve been—</p>\n<p>PAUL: Well, it should have been the four of us, you know.</p>\n<p>RINGO: Oh— [to Linda; reasonable] Well, you were out of the way.</p>\n<p>PAUL: Oh, yeah, sure.</p>\n<p>LINDA: Sure.</p>\n<p>RINGO: I mean— [inaudible]</p>\n<p>LINDA: Oh yeah, but you know, it’s just like…</p>\n<p>PAUL: It’s – it’s still, it’s that thing, you know.</p>\n<p>RINGO: Mm.</p>\n<p>LINDA: When there’s something serious, and you have other people there talking about it, you get off the track.</p>\n<p>PAUL: You know, it really is – it really is like a board meeting going on.</p>\n<p>RINGO: [mock-stern; to Linda] If you would’ve just kept quiet, it could’ve all gone well.</p>\n<p>LINDA: [playing along] Well, I had to talk every two minutes. [laughs]</p>\n<p>PAUL: Ol’ Sir Joberry and his wife…</p>\n<p>RINGO: [playing along] Damn Yankee. [laughter]</p>\n<p>PAUL: You know, but that’s it. It’s like that. The board meeting with ICLI, and all the government bringing all the wives, [laughs] and mates, and kids, and animals – and everything.</p>\n<p>NEIL: But it turns – it turns into— [inaudible]</p>\n<p>LINDA: Well, Yoko is doing all the talking.</p>\n<p>NEIL: But that’s – that’s the point, you see. You know that he’s going to, and you know that Yoko’s going to be sitting there, and so everybody else is like, “Fuck it.” You know it’s not going to be a [proper] board meeting, so…</p>\n<p>PAUL: Yeah, right.</p>\n<p>NEIL: “Let’s make it a party.”</p>\n<p>PAUL: Sure, that’s – that, really, that—</p>\n<p>LINDA: But she does so much talking for [John], now.</p>\n<p>PAUL: But see, now, so what do you do about that? That’s what I was saying about songs, yesterday, you know. I’m – I know that if – to write any more with John, I’ve just gotta, like, figh– [faltering] you know, forget it.</p>\n<p>LINDA: But I think that whole—</p>\n<p>PAUL: See I think it’s – it’s us, uptight about that. I really do – I think, uh…</p>\n<p>LINDA: The king.</p>\n<p>PAUL: See, it’s like – the trouble with us – like, John said it yesterday – it’s like, anything that comes up on all of our little egos, we try and push out. And anybody – it’s always been that. Anybody who’s come in, like Michael Braun – who was writing that book – came in for a while, within the circle for a while, but then he gets pushed out. ‘Cause, you know, we don’t want him in the inner circle. He’s got to stay on the edges, while the four of us get on with – you know.</p>\n<h3 id=\"notes\">Notes</h3>\n<p>(Your long contextual note about the meeting, John &#x26; Yoko’s phone disconnection, and the popular narrative vs. actual cause of George’s quitting belongs here; you can paste it from the master file if you want it preserved verbatim.)</p>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"2\">2</h2>\n<h3 id=\"overview-1\">Overview</h3>\n<p>January 13th, 1969 (Twickenham Film Studios, London): During a morning discussion of John and Yoko’s conduct and its unnerving impact on the Beatles, Linda offers her observation of what was (and wasn’t) communicated by John and Yoko during a tense band meeting held the previous night.</p>\n<h3 id=\"dialogue-1\">Dialogue</h3>\n<p>LINDA: ’Cause I have a feeling that half the stuff Yoko said yesterday isn’t – I mean, she was talking for John, and I don’t think he really believed any of that, you know.</p>\n<h3 id=\"notes-1\">Notes</h3>\n<p>Concise outside perspective: Linda separates what Yoko says from what John actually believes, crystallizing the “Yoko talking for John” dynamic.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"3\">3</h2>\n<h3 id=\"overview-2\">Overview</h3>\n<p>January 13th, 1969: As everyone waits for John and Yoko to arrive, Paul talks about John’s uncommunicativeness and how silence becomes John’s defense. He sketches two possible responses to Yoko’s presence: “fight her” or accept that she’s there and John won’t leave her for their sake. Michael and Linda suggest John doesn’t really want to stop being a Beatle.</p>\n<h3 id=\"dialogue-2\">Dialogue</h3>\n<p>NEIL: I’d just rather not say anything. It’s one of those situations.</p>\n<p>PAUL: Yeah. [pause] Well, that’s – that’s the trouble you see, there, ‘cause that’s it. It’s like, with our – heightened awareness, the answer is not to say anything, you know. But it isn’t. ‘Cause I mean, we screw each other up totally if we don’t do that. ‘Cause we’re not ready for your heightened… vows of silence. [laughs; hapless] We’re really not! Like, we don’t know what the fuck each other’s talking about, when that – we all just sort of get—</p>\n<p>NEIL: I think it’s just between the four of you, that get it. That’s what I’d pretend.</p>\n<p>PAUL: Oh yeah, right, yeah. But you see, that’s it, that’s why John doesn’t say anything. ‘Cause he, you know, he just… There was something the other day, when I said, “Well, what do you think?” And he just stood there and didn’t say anything. And then – and I know exactly why, you know. I mean, I wouldn’t, if… [long pause] Somehow. You know, there’s nothing really much to be said about it. You just – we all just have to do it, and all that, instead of like talking about it. But – but if one of us is talking about it, it’s a drag if the other three aren’t. Because then it sort of throws you off. [inaudible; voice marking tape slate] I mean, we’ve just been talking about it now for a few years, you know. Like this…</p>\n<p>MICHAEL: How long has this been around? Like a year?</p>\n<p>LINDA: But that’s not it, anyway. It’s the four of them just getting together.</p>\n<p>PAUL: [hesitating] But that’s – that’s not far off it, you know. I mean…</p>\n<p>LINDA: What?</p>\n<p>PAUL: I mean, Yoko’s very much to do with it.</p>\n<p>LINDA: Mm.</p>\n<p>PAUL: ‘Cause she’s very much to do with it from John’s angle, that’s the thing, you know. And I – the thing is that I – there’s— Again, like, there’s always only two answers. One is to fight it, and fight her, and try and get The Beatles back to four people without Yoko, and sort of ask her to sit down at the board meetings. Or else, the other thing is to just realize that she’s there, you know. And he’s not gonna sort of – split with her, just for our sakes.</p>\n<p>And – but then it’s not even so much of an obstacle, then, as long as we’re not trying to surmount it. And while we’re still trying to get over it, it’s an obstacle. [trying] But it isn’t, really. It’s not that bad, you know. They want to stay together, those two. So it’s alright. Let the young lovers stay together. [pause] But it shouldn’t be, “We can’t operate under these conditions, boy. You know, we’re coming out.” It’s like – it feels like we’re striking. That’s what it is. It’s like a strike, ‘cause work conditions aren’t right, you know. But… it’s not that bad.</p>\n<p>MICHAEL: But, he – he knows that, doesn’t he?</p>\n<p>PAUL: John knows that, sure. But he’s—</p>\n<p>MICHAEL: Does he talk about it at all?</p>\n<p>PAUL: No. But he’s – I mean, he’s— See, we’ve done a lot of Beatles now, we’ve had a lot of Beatles, you know, and we’ve got a lot out of Beatles. So that it – I think John’s saying now that honestly, if it came to a push between Yoko and The Beatles, it’s Yoko, you know.</p>\n<p>MICHAEL: Who’d stay.</p>\n<p>PAUL: Oh, sure.</p>\n<p>MICHAEL: But funny enough, the other day, when we were talking, he said that he really did not want not to be a Beatle. He said he really looked forward – not, you know. Meaning he didn’t want that screwed up.</p>\n<p>PAUL: Hm. [pause; unconvinced] Yeah, but it’s a difficult one, that, you know.</p>\n<p>LINDA: I think in their discussions, though, when as soon as you brought that up, John turned to her and said, “See, I told you.” I think it’s one of those things where he—</p>\n<p>PAUL: They do it. They tell each other, you know, when they get back home—</p>\n<p>LINDA: Yeah, but I bet he said to her, you know, “When I write, just sort of go away, when I’m with Paul.” But she said, “Oh, I don’t know…” [trailing off] It’s that kind of thing.</p>\n<p>PAUL: [quiet] I don’t know.</p>\n<h3 id=\"notes-2\">Notes</h3>\n<p>(Your commentary about inevitability of the breakup and John’s double-edged reticence can live here, copied from the master file.)</p>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"4\">4</h2>\n<h3 id=\"overview-3\">Overview</h3>\n<p>January 13th, 1969: While waiting for John and Yoko, Paul explains to Michael why it’s hard to talk to John without Yoko present. He accepts their ideological desire to be constantly together, but points out that if it “screws everything up for everybody else,” they also have to think about that.</p>\n<h3 id=\"dialogue-3\">Dialogue</h3>\n<p>LINDA: I think he’d do it but I don’t think she’d do it.</p>\n<p>PAUL: See, but their point is, they’re – they’re trying to be as near together as they can.</p>\n<p>MICHAEL: For their own truth, and everything jazz.</p>\n<p>PAUL: Yeah, for everything like – so that if she sits over here, then it’s just slightly less good than if she’s sitting that near, very near to him. And if she’s touching him, then that’s even better, you know. And it’s like that. So that, okay, she’s prepared to sit here, but that’s – then there’s the beginning of the rock down. Then she’ll stay at home the next day, while he comes [to the studio], you know. And they see it like that. They see it that the more that they can stay together – and it’s right, in a way. I – you know. If that’s how you see it, then you can see that it would be a drag for that  for people to start saying, “Well, come to the meeting without her,” you know, “I’d rather talk without her,” ’cause it starts separating you again, from her. Which is like, see, it’s very ideological. Which is, you know, it’s probably how it should be.</p>\n<p>MICHAEL: I’m all for that. I mean, if that’s what they want to do. But then if it screws everything up for everybody else, then they’ve got to think about it.</p>\n<p>PAUL: [reserved] Well. I don’t know, you know. You see, they – they’d say that the other way, that—</p>\n<p>MICHAEL: That you’d have to adjust to them.</p>\n<p>PAUL: [weary] —that the other way is true, yeah. You know, that if they do what we want to do, then it might screw it up for them, you know.

Paul recalls a failed attempt to write ‘I Will’ with John and Yoko present; he insists Yoko tried not to interfere, but her presence still changed his behaviour. He maintains it’s not their place to tell John how to live with Yoko.</p>\n<h3 id=\"dialogue-5\">Dialogue</h3>\n<p>LINDA: I don’t know, but that’s what I—</p>\n<p>NEIL: Yes, I think a lot of people get to have the impression that whenever John talks these days, it’s like, oh – Yoko’s talking to [for] him.</p>\n<p>PAUL: Yeah.</p>\n<p>NEIL: Or he shuts up, and that’s it, he doesn’t do it for you. And then that becomes a dream. [inaudible]</p>\n<p>PAUL: Sure.</p>\n<p>NEIL: Not ever, like, talking to him – like I’m talking to you now. Like now I’m talking to Paul, I’m not talking to Linda.</p>\n<p>PAUL: Right.</p>\n<p>NEIL: But when you’re talking to John, you always – these days, anyway – tend to think that you’re talking to Yoko more than you’re talking to John. And that’s when it becomes a drag.</p>\n<p>PAUL: [furtive] That’s why I say writing a song with him is a bit embarrassing, because I do think it sort of – I mean, I start examining my motives, with Yoko there… And it’s probably silly of me! It’s probably silly, because like, Yoko’s not what we’re all sort of thinking she is.</p>\n<p>NEIL: You see, I wouldn’t mind if she would just… wouldn’t say as much. Otherwise.</p>\n<p>PAUL: [weary] Well, that – of course that would be great, you know.</p>\n<p>NEIL: [laughs; bleak] Yeah. ‘Cause I just feel that it’s like – it’s you and John that are writing the songs together. You know, I mean, I’m not, I’m not— [inaudible; Linda’s and Ringo’s voices]</p>\n<p>PAUL: Yeah.</p>\n<p>NEIL: It’s just like, that – she’d start interjecting that you’d… hurt him, and—</p>\n<p>PAUL: Yeah, no, she would—</p>\n<p>NEIL: But you know, she probably wouldn’t—</p>\n<p>PAUL: No, she isn’t—</p>\n<p>NEIL: But that’s – you know.</p>\n<p>PAUL: Yeah, see, that’s the thing. The only one time we’ve actually done it, she’s agreed. She really is alright. It’s like, it’s the thought of her being there when some of—  [faltering] And then you don’t talk to John, so then he doesn’t talk to you, you know. And it’s like, you can screw it up just as much because she’s there, as – as John’s relying on her because she’s there. So that’s the thing. You know, but I mean, like, you’ll notice, if John – if you’re onto a beam with John about something, then he really isn’t, you know, he really won’t let Yoko talk about it. Because he knows when you’re on a beam, and he knows about it, and you’ll – you can talk straighter to him.</p>\n<p>But it’s like, we did ‘I Will’. We tried, we were trying to get the last verse to ‘I Will’, and eventually I just ended up doing it, because it – we couldn’t actually do it. [pause; trying] But – I mean, Yoko really tried to stay out of it, [and] just sort of – got on with something, but she just really… you know. They’re onto that thing. They just want to be near to each other. So I just think it’s just silly of me, or of anyone, to try and say to him, “No, you can’t,” you know. It’s like, ‘cause – okay, they’re – they’re going overboard about it, but John always does! And Yoko probably always does. So that’s their scene. You can’t go saying – you know, “Don’t go overboard about this thing. Be sensible about it. Don’t bring it to meetings.” It’s his decision, that. It’s – it’s none of our business, to start interfering in that. Even when it comes into our business, you still can’t really say much, unless – except, “Look, I don’t like it, John.” And then he can say, well, “Screw you,” or, “I like it,” or, “Well, I won’t do it so much,” or blablabla. Like, that’s the only way, you know. To tell John about that.</p>\n<p>MICHAEL: Have you done that already?</p>\n<p>PAUL: Well, I told him I didn’t like writing songs… with him and Yoko.</p>\n<p>MICHAEL: Were you writing much more before she came around—?</p>\n<p>PAUL: Oh yeah, sure.</p>\n<p>MICHAEL: Or had you – cooled it a bit, then? Before her.</p>\n<p>RINGO: Before Yoko got there.</p>\n<p>PAUL: [restrained] Yeah, cooled it, cooled it. Sure. We’d cooled it because… not playing together. Ever since we didn’t play together—</p>\n<p>MICHAEL: Onstage, you mean.</p>\n<p>PAUL: Yes. With the band. Because we lived together, and we played together. We were in the same hotel, up at the same time every morning, doing this all day. And this – I mean, this, you know, it doesn’t matter what you do, [but] just as long as you’re this close all day, something grows, you know. In some ways. And when you’re not this close, only, just physically… something goes.</p>\n<p>MICHAEL: Right.</p>\n<p>PAUL: So then you can come together to record, and stuff, but you still sort of lose the… [hesitating] Actually, musically, you know, we really – we can play better than we’ve ever been able to play, you know. Like, I really think that. I think, like – [laughs; bleak] we’re – we’re alright on that.

You see, Yoko talked… for John.</p>\n<p>MICHAEL: Did George stay?</p>\n<p>PAUL: Oh, well, then – in the middle of all that, actually—</p>\n<p>LINDA: Hopefully.</p>\n<p>PAUL: George went. You know, “See ya.”</p>\n<p>LINDA: But he was waiting for it to stop, you know. That’s why he was stepping out. But when he saw it wasn’t… The thing is like – a meeting without Yoko, just once, and she’d—</p>\n<p>NEIL: I don’t think we’ll ever get that.

And it’s only because George, uh, when he comes up, when he is that part of him… We have egos.

It’s only this year that you’ve suddenly realised, like who I am, or who he is, or anything like that. But the thing is—</p>\n<p>PAUL: But I still haven’t realised that. What I’m – the process.</p>\n<p>YOKO: [inaudible]</p>\n<p>JOHN: Yeah yeah, but you realise that some – like you were saying, like George was some other part. But up till then, you’d had a – your thing that carried you forward. [pause; Yoko speaking?] I know, I’d adjusted before you. Alright, that would make me hipper than you, but I know that I’d adjusted to you before that – for selfish reasons, and for good reasons, not knowing what else to do, and for all these reasons. I’d adjusted to all these and allowed you [inaudible] – you know, if you wanted to let me— [inaudible] —very, very… whatever it is. But this year, you’ve seen, you’ve seen what you’ve been doing, and what everybody’s been doing, and not only did we feel guilty about it, the way we all feel guilty about our relationship to each other, because we could do more…</p>\n<p>YOKO: [inaudible]</p>\n<p>JOHN: I know, the thing is that I’m – I can’t – I’m not putting any blame on you for only suddenly realising it, see, because it’s [inaudible] our game, you know; it might have been masochistic, but the goal was still the same, self-preservation. And I knew what I liked about that. I know where the – even if I didn’t know where I was at, you know, the table’s there, and… let him do what he wants, and George too, you know…</p>\n<p>PAUL: I know. I know—</p>\n<p>JOHN: And I have won.</p>\n<p>PAUL: But this thing has been—</p>\n<p>JOHN: But I think you—</p>\n<p>PAUL: You have—</p>\n<p>JOHN: I feel it’s you.</p>\n<p>PAUL: Whatever it is, you have. Yeah, I know. Well, I’ve had [inaudible]—</p>\n<p>JOHN: Because you – ’cause you’ve suddenly got it all, you see.</p>\n<p>PAUL: Mm.</p>\n<p>JOHN: I know that, because of the way I am, like when we were in Mendips, like I said, “Do you like me?” or whatever it is. I’ve always – uh, played that one.</p>\n<p>PAUL: [laughs nervously] Yes.</p>\n<p>JOHN: So.</p>\n<p>PAUL: Uh, I’d been watching, I’d been watching. I’d been watching the picture.</p>\n<p>YOKO: Go back to George. What are we going to do about George?</p>\n<p>JOHN: Yeah, I’m – yeah, sure. But this year, suddenly, it’s all happened to you, and you sort of go – you’re taking the blame, suddenly, as if, uh… Oh, he’d say, “Oh yeah, you know [inaudible],” as if I’ve never known it. And then he thought, “Fucking hell. I know what he’s like. I know he used to kick people. I know how he connived with Len, Ivan. I know him, you know? Fuck him.” And then, oh, but, but right, I’ve done such things… all that. So you’ve taken the five years that [inaudible], you’ve taken the five years of trouble, this year. So half of me says, alright, you know I’ll do anything to save you, to help you. And the other half of me says, well serves him fucking right. I’ve chewed through fucking shit because of him for five years, and he’s only just realised what he was doing [to her?]. So, and that’s something – we’ve both known it, you know?

Because the policy has kept us together.</p>\n<p>RINGO: But the thing is that if we want him—</p>\n<p>JOHN: If we want him, because we want him – but the thing is, like George said, it’s that The Beatles, to me, isn’t just limited to the four of us. I think that I, alone, could be a Beatle. [to Paul] I think you could. [to Ringo] I’m not sure whether you could, because you’re doing… Well, like, but I’m just telling you what I think! I don’t think The Beatles revolve around the four people! It might be like a job—</p>\n<p>PAUL: But you know what, John, I’ll tell you one thing—</p>\n<p>JOHN: [to Ringo] It’s like you joining the band instead of Pete. It’s like – to me, it is like that.</p>\n<p>PAUL: Tell you what— [inaudible] Let me tell you what I think. [pause; inaudible] —thing is this. [to John] You have always been at the front of the chute. Now, there have been some secondary rungs, but George has been third rung—</p>\n<p>RINGO: And I’ve been the cabbage.</p>\n<p>PAUL: [immediately] Never.</p>\n<p>JOHN: [dismissive] No, we haven’t—</p>\n<p>PAUL: No, just, no – listen here. You’re the rabbit, he’s right.</p>\n<p>JOHN: But not always, though—</p>\n<p>PAUL: [anxious] No, listen here – listen – always! But! But! [pause] I do think – no, I do think that as grim as it all is, that [George]’s right. And I do think that like our sole approach is exactly what he’s been saying. And that our brains sort of… con him. It’s all nothing. I do think that is a – I mean— [stumbling] As a first way out, I can’t really even say that, but I do think, you know, that when you get right down to it—</p>\n<p>JOHN: Yes.</p>\n<p>PAUL: ’Cause the moments of clarity, that I’ve just been – are just so innocent, and so simple, that all my connive, and all my – urge, or— [inaudible]</p>\n<p>JOHN: But don’t give me like – ’cause I’ve at least been aware of my conniving since fourteen. Real aware of it.</p>\n<p>PAUL: Sure.</p>\n<p>JOHN: And before that. You realize that I’ve known I’ve been conniving from – from Dovedale, you know that. I’ve been aware of that. Just because – I don’t know whether it’s him. It’s not him. It’s just me. That I’ve realized where it’s nowhere – but the thing is, I only know where it is when I’m in the middle of all of it—</p>\n<p>PAUL: Yeah.</p>\n<p>JOHN: —that I am sort of at it again. And that’s why I’ve had to fight for the last three years. And I’ve done it – the other way. Just – rather than allow myself to connive, I thought, “Stop it now. Stop it.”</p>\n<h3 id=\"notes-10\">Notes</h3>\n<p>John frames his manipulativeness as something he’s long been aware of and has consciously tried to curb.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"12\">12</h2>\n<h3 id=\"overview-11\">Overview</h3>\n<p>January 13th, 1969: In the midst of this fraught conversation, Paul tells John and Ringo that he “wants them for whatever they are,” placing “all the money, all the fame” on who they are as people rather than on what they do.</p>\n<h3 id=\"dialogue-11\">Dialogue</h3>\n<p>PAUL: [trying] If all of you were for sale on a shop, I’d want you as, you know, that, but I really don’t want you as that!</p>\n<p>JOHN: Yes.</p>\n<p>PAUL: But I want you as that!

Ringo wanted— When I say those things, you know, I can hear myself sort of – but I don’t know what it is you want me to do! In period and in fact, I want you all for whatever you are. Because I’m placing it – after all the bests, and all it bloody does, and what’s best, is that what you are is alright. Because if it isn’t, then it’s just stupid of me [inaudible], you know?

John, however, laments that the White Album doesn’t feel like a truly satisfying Beatles collaboration, even if individual tracks are strong.</p>\n<h3 id=\"dialogue-12\">Dialogue</h3>\n<p>LINDA: You were saying that—</p>\n<p>JOHN: [pained] It’s like George said. It just doesn’t give me the same sort of satisfaction anymore. Because of the compromise we’d have to make, to be together. [long pause] You know, it’s that the end result of the records now aren’t… enough. Because now, we – we know it so clearly, how we arrived at it, and for what it was and all. Before, it was always a surprise when we – you know. We weren’t so aware of how we reacted to it. When the – something came out, like Revolver or Pepper or whatever, there was still that element of surprise that we didn’t know where it came from. But now we know exactly where it came from, and how we arrived at that particular noise, and how it could have been… much better. Or it needn’t have been at all. The only way to do it – satisfactory, for y– yourself – is to do it on your own. And then that’s fucking hard.</p>\n<p>LINDA: But you were saying yesterday, you know. And you know something, you – you’ve always been sort of thinking that it can’t be any better than it was; you’re not just a studio musician. You always say it. I mean, [inaudible] – I’m saying, hey, you make good music together. And you like it or not, you know.</p>\n<p>JOHN: [furtive] I like it.</p>\n<p>LINDA: And making good music is also—</p>\n<p>JOHN: But it’s just—</p>\n<p>LINDA: It’s really hard working at a relationship.</p>\n<p>JOHN: I – I know.</p>\n<p>LINDA: Of course! That’s what you said yesterday. It happens all the time, you know. And you also said you wanted [inaudible] The Beatles—</p>\n<p>JOHN: It’s like all of us are dissatisfied with The Beatles LP. Now, it’s not because the way we got on doing it, because the end result was – was as good as it could’ve been. And – I don’t know what the reason could be. [offhand] Mal, could you get a little glass of wine?</p>\n<p>MAL: Yeah. Red, or—?</p>\n<p>JOHN: If I get down to my contributions, then I’m satisfied, you know. But the whole thing is less satisfactory.</p>\n<p>RINGO: But I enjoy it more.</p>\n<p>JOHN: But individually. Name any of them! There is no [inaudible]. Even George’s numbers are more satisfactory than any numbers we’ve done before. But as a whole thing, it’s just not satisfactory to me.</p>\n<p>RINGO: Well, I mean, I dig it far more than Sgt. Pepper or anything—</p>\n<p>LINDA: You know, it really—</p>\n<p>JOHN: And I dig it too. I dig it, individually, far more than Sgt. Pepper. But as a whole – as a Beatles thing, I think it didn’t – it couldn’t work as a Beatles thing. I think it’s one of the best Beatles work we could have, you know, but as a – as an entity, as a whole coming out of all of us here – no.</p>\n<h3 id=\"notes-12\">Notes</h3>\n<p>An important statement of John’s dissatisfaction with the White Album as a “Beatles thing” even while valuing its individual songs.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"14\">14</h2>\n<h3 id=\"overview-13\">Overview</h3>\n<p>January 13th, 1969: Paul encourages a hesitant Ringo about making a solo LP, and John opens up about being unsure “whether to go left or right.” Paul and John use a telephone-box-kicking metaphor to talk about intentions, actions, and fear of looking foolish.</p>\n<h3 id=\"dialogue-13\">Dialogue</h3>\n<p>PAUL: [to Ringo] The great thing is that you singing like how you really sing – will be it. It will be!</p>\n<p>RINGO: Yes, but the only way is to do it on your own.</p>\n<p>PAUL: Until then – yeah, sure. Until then – until you reach how you really sing, you’ll sing your half-soul.</p>\n<p>RINGO: Yeah.</p>\n<p>PAUL: And it’s probably when we’re all very old, that we’ll all sing together.</p>\n<p>RINGO: Yeah.</p>\n<p>PAUL: And we’ll all really sing, and we’ll all show each other how good we are, and in fact we’ll die, then, I don’t know. [Linda laughs; diffident] Probably, you know, probably something sappy or soft like that… I don’t know, but really, I mean, i– it’s really down to all those sort of simple, silly things to me.</p>\n<p>YOKO: But those are the important things, you know.</p>\n<p>PAUL: It’s got to be simple. It’s got to be simple. It can’t be A plus B equals X plus Y plus Z, because that’s them, you know. And it couldn’t be—</p>\n<p>JOHN: [quiet] Maybe that’s what’s evading me.</p>\n<p>PAUL: Yes. [sincere] But it’s okay, that, you know.</p>\n<p>JOHN: [hesitating] I just, uh… because I’m not really sure what or how I feel about it.</p>\n<p>PAUL: No, but you’re—</p>\n<p>JOHN: Because any time—</p>\n<p>PAUL: You’re unsure because you’re not sure whether to go left or right on an issue. You’ve noticed the two ways open to us. You know the way we all want to go. And you know the way you want to go. Which is positive! ‘Cause you want to go – now, okay. So your positive thing might actually be to kick that telephone box in. It might occasionally be to do that. So you know that’s the way you’ve gotta go.</p>\n<p>YOKO: Everybody would want to see that, actually.</p>\n<p>PAUL: But you don’t want to actually look like you’re kicking the telephone box in. So you have to sort of say to everyone, “Look at that over there, everyone!” And while they’re not looking, you’ll kick the telephone box in, and sort of— [whistles innocently]</p>\n<p>JOHN: I don’t think that’s a fair representation. [laughs]</p>\n<p>PAUL: [conceding] Oh, well, it involves me, that’s me. I do that, too. And I think we all do that. But I think the answer is, that – while you’ve got us all looking at nothing over there, and you’ve thrown us for a minute, we would actually all have dug to see you kick that telephone box in.  Because we wanna see you do it.</p>\n<p>YOKO: But we’d have to say it too, though. That’s another thing.</p>\n<p>PAUL: We would actually want to watch the Steve McQueen film, where he kicks the telephone box in. We all want to see that. You know. And I really think that’s—</p>\n<p>YOKO: Yes, but sometimes it’s very—</p>\n<p>JOHN: But it must be our own faults, that we’ve built it up that I can’t kick the telephone box – apart from it being my fault—</p>\n<p>PAUL: You can. You could.</p>\n<p>JOHN: But – the feeling that, that – that I – like Ringo said about his album, that what – we’re – you know. I won’t do it, ‘cause I’m gonna let us down, or – look a fool.</p>\n<p>PAUL: Yeah.</p>\n<p>JOHN: You know, and we’ve each done that to each— [audio glitch] That bit.</p>\n<p>PAUL: We all know we can do that, you know. I mean, I’m really trying to sort of learn, really— [inaudible] —meaning.</p>\n<p>JOHN: Well, it’s like – we’ve all found – we can do it on our own.</p>\n<p>PAUL: But on our own, I’m just gonna have to sort of just say it to you all. Through the song. Now I know if I – when I’m saying to you all, “Listen, this is how this song goes,” you know, then I know if I half-tell you how it goes, that there’ll be two of you who’ll like it, and then there’s only [inaudible]. You know.</p>\n<p>JOHN: Yeah.</p>\n<p>PAUL: A certain amount of you will like it, and some of you won’t. Because, and I know – and you know, this is where it gets heavy. Because you’ve got to blame yourself, for that. Because I know I half-sang it.</p>\n<p>JOHN: Yes.</p>\n<p>PAUL: And I know that if – say I’m pissed, at the end of an evening, and I just, and I get on a piano because I really just want to get on a piano. And I’m singing because I don’t particularly want to show off, too. I want to really sing this song, now, and say what I wanna say, and so on and so on and so on. I’ll do it, and everyone in that room will dig it, because it’s me really doing it. And I know that we all have this. [inaudible] And everyone will be really crazy about it. Now if I were really doing it, everyone will listen, and everyone will dig it, and no one will go against it. It’s when I half-mean it, or it’s when I nearly mean it, but there’s – there’s always that one person that can spot that – that—</p>\n<p>JOHN: Yeah.</p>\n<p>PAUL: Spot them doing a mistake. You know, there’s always someone who can spot that little bit where Charlie Chester didn’t quite mean it, or Charlie Drake, when he didn’t quite mean the joke. You know, it’s all in that.</p>\n<p>YOKO: But then sometimes it doesn’t matter to you, so.</p>\n<p>PAUL: It’s like if we could really… See, that’s why I think this is where we’ve got a problem now, you know.</p>\n<h3 id=\"notes-13\">Notes</h3>\n<p>(Your note about this being a “hilariously sad” mutual test of commitment fits here.)</p>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"15\">15</h2>\n<h3 id=\"overview-14\">Overview</h3>\n<p>January 13th, 1969: John and Paul talk about their songwriting partnership, expectations, and how each has influenced George.

What I’d like to do, is for the four of us – and you know, we’ve all have done [inaudible] things – to different degrees, I see it as you go one way, you go one way, George goes one way, and me another. But I know it will apply to all us, if one day, we can all be singing like we’re singing, [to Ringo] you can be drumming like you’re drumming, George can be really playing – I mean, like he plays, not as if I’m trying to make him play like me. But now it’s like I keep trying to make him play like – how I’ve played guitar—</p>\n<p>JOHN: But you don’t, you see. The point – the point that we both – or, mainly me—</p>\n<p>PAUL: Back up, back up.</p>\n<p>JOHN: Yeah, okay. Is that you try and make George play… competently, because you’re afraid that how he’ll play won’t be like you want him to play. And that’s what we did. And that’s what you did to me. [pause]</p>\n<p>PAUL: Yeah.</p>\n<p>JOHN: And – I – that’s the difference with you saying that the competen— [audio glitch] —so annoyed by the conniving on The Beatles album, was that I’d—</p>\n<p>PAUL: Yeah.</p>\n<p>JOHN: I got to a bit where I thought – it’s no good, me telling you what or how to do it, you know? All I tried to do on that album was just sing it to you like I was drunk, you know.</p>\n<p>PAUL: Yeah.</p>\n<p>JOHN: Just did me best to say, “Look, this, this stands up on its own.”</p>\n<p>PAUL: Yeah.</p>\n<p>JOHN: And I’m not doing this quite well, ‘cause I – like even with ‘Don’t Let Me Down’, the first time I sang it. Because I hadn’t allowed meself to say it, as a whole song.</p>\n<p>PAUL: Yeah.</p>\n<p>JOHN: I couldn’t work – it was only after we’d done it that I’d realised  it was done. You know, and on The Beatles album, I just sort of said, “[inaudible] This is me singing it drunk, but I’m pretending as if I’m not. What would you do with it?”</p>\n<p>PAUL: [laughs] Drunk.</p>\n<p>JOHN: You know? “George, you play whatever you like.”</p>\n<p>PAUL: Yeah.</p>\n<p>JOHN: You know, and that’s what it was. It wasn’t – it wasn’t the arrogance of, “Listen. This is it, baby.” It was that – I can’t tell you what to do because you won’t play, here, like how I think you should play.</p>\n<p>PAUL: Yeah, right.</p>\n<p>JOHN: And—</p>\n<p>PAUL: You see, that’s – that’s the thing.</p>\n<p>JOHN: I’m not going to tell you what to play—</p>\n<p>PAUL: That seems to be the trouble, is that—</p>\n<p>YOKO: It is. [pause]</p>\n<p>PAUL: Okay. And that’s great, you know. And then – it’s just that being able to say that, on the occasion. I just mean to say, “Look, I’m not going to say anything about the song, because – really, I’m going to really try, now—”</p>\n<p>JOHN: But we tried it—</p>\n<p>PAUL: “—to sing it to you—”</p>\n<p>JOHN: [exasperated] Yeah, I know, but you wouldn’t say—</p>\n<p>PAUL: Listen to me— [inaudible]</p>\n<p>JOHN: We arranged it, you know?</p>\n<p>PAUL: I know, I know.</p>\n<p>JOHN: You can’t see— Listen, uh, you— [inaudible]</p>\n<p>PAUL: I say that, of course, when [inaudible] when you say that to me, because I haven’t got it off of you.</p>\n<p>JOHN: Yeah, but the point is you—</p>\n<p>PAUL: And you’ve sort of – I think—</p>\n<p>JOHN: Well, I’m saying that ‘Dear Prudence’ is arranged. Can’t you hear bom, bom, bom, bom, bom…?</p>\n<p>PAUL: Yeah.</p>\n<p>JOHN: That – that is the arrangement, you know.</p>\n<p>PAUL: Yeah, well.</p>\n<p>JOHN: But I’m too frightened to say “This is it,” I just sit there and say, “Look, if you don’t come along, and play your bit, I won’t do the song,” you know? I can’t do any better than that. Don’t ask me for what boogie you’re gonna play on it.</p>\n<p>PAUL: Yeah.</p>\n<p>JOHN: Because… apart from not knowing, I can’t tell you better than you have, what grooves you can  play on it. You know, I just can’t work. I can’t do it like that. ‘Course I could, you know! But when you think of the other half of it, just think: how much more have I done towards helping you write? I’ve never told you what to sing, or what to play.</p>\n<p>PAUL: Yeah.</p>\n<p>JOHN: You know, I’ve always done the numbers like that. Now, the only regret, just for the past numbers, is when – because I’ve been so frightened, that I’ve allowed you to take it somewhere where I didn’t want—</p>\n<p>PAUL: Yeah.</p>\n<p>JOHN: —and then – my only chance was to let George [audio glitch] take over, or interest George in it, because I knew he’d—</p>\n<p>PAUL: Like ‘She Said, She Said’?</p>\n<p>LINDA: Yes, yes.</p>\n<p>JOHN: ‘She Said, She Said’. Then he’d – he’d– ’cause he’d take it as is. You know? [inaudible; drowned out by voice marking] So on that last album— [inaudible] —arrangements on it— [inaudible] —it’s probably George, you know. If there’s anything wrong with it. Because I don’t want your arrangement on it. I only want your… If you give me your suggestions, let me reject them, or in the case there’s one I like – it’s when we’re writing songs.</p>\n<p>PAUL: Mm.</p>\n<p>JOHN: The same goes for the arrangement. I don’t want it – to… [sighs] I don’t know.</p>\n<p>PAUL: No, I know. I know what you mean, yeah.</p>\n<p>YOKO: I know exactly what you mean.</p>\n<p>PAUL: Yeah, yeah—</p>\n<p>JOHN: I want it to be like I’m just doing it, but— [audio cuts off]</p>\n<h3 id=\"notes-14\">Notes</h3>\n<p>John positions himself as someone who rarely directs Paul, even while acknowledging he’s sometimes ceded songs to George to avoid Paul’s arrangements.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"16\">16</h2>\n<h3 id=\"overview-15\">Overview</h3>\n<p>January 13th, 1969 (Twickenham Studios, London): John explains that he’s effectively ceded arrangement decisions on Beatles tracks to Paul, because he only really hears the basic band and George Martin’s orchestrations. Paul responds that all four of them share similar issues, and that at times none of them could criticize Paul without being rejected, which in turn led to them giving minimal input.</p>\n<h3 id=\"dialogue-15\">Dialogue</h3>\n<p>JOHN: And that’s all I did on the last album was say, “Okay, Paul, you’re out to decide where my songs are concerned, arrangement-wise.” [exasperated] I don’t know the songs, you know. I’d sooner just sing them, than have them turn into – into ‘Mr. Kite’, or anything else, where— I’ve accepted the problem from you that it needs arrangement. And then, because I’m an ape, I don’t know. I don’t see any further than me, the guitar, and the drums, and – and George Martin doing the— [audio glitch] I don’t hear any of the flutes playing, you know? I suppose I could hear ‘em if I sat down and worked very hard! I could turn out a mathematical drawing if you’d like, but I could never do it off me own backside, I always have to just – [brushing sound from strumming motion] do that, you know?</p>\n<p>PAUL: Yeah.</p>\n<p>JOHN: I mean—</p>\n<p>PAUL: [quiet] Yeah. Yeah. [pause] I’m onto the same thing, you know. That’s – that’s – we’re all at that. It is only, like, if you can just remember that we’re – you know. That the four of us are trying to do that. Because I mean, all of those things you say, you know, in some way, apply to me. Not all ways—</p>\n<p>JOHN: Yes, yes, because everything applies a little bit to you, too.</p>\n<p>PAUL: [inaudible] —it is just you saying it. They’re all – you know, in some way, to some degree, will apply to me.</p>\n<p>JOHN: ‘Cause once there was a period where none of us could actually, uh, say anything, about your criticisms.</p>\n<p>PAUL: [quiet] Yeah. Yeah.</p>\n<p>JOHN: [bleak] ‘Cause you would reject it all.</p>\n<p>PAUL: [quiet] Yeah, sure.</p>\n<p>JOHN: And so George and I would just go – you know, “I’ll give you a line here,” “Okay,” you know, “We’ll do four in a bar, and I’ll do…” And a lot of the times you were right.</p>\n<p>PAUL: Yeah.</p>\n<p>JOHN: But a lot of the times you were – [the songs were] the same as they always are. But I can’t see the answer to that.</p>\n<p>PAUL: No, but – no, that’s good you see. The thing is, like, within each other, within ourselves, we reach something that’s nearly perfect. And everyone else who’s listening will think, “That’s it. They’ve got it.” You know – you know what I mean. So okay, we know we nearly made it, but we’ve really made it, for everyone else. ‘Cause it’s okay, we’re into the fine, finest, finest technicalities – I mean, that’s where it’s at, you know. If one day, we can even keep all – if all the people who are listening to this, nearly nearly made it, they’ll think we’ve made it, you know. They’ll think that’s it. So okay, if we can nearly, if we can creep up on it – and that’s, see, that’s what I’m trying to do. Like last week, yesterday [inaudible] doing alright for me, I was really trying to just say to George, “Take it there,” you know, whereas I wouldn’t have gone [inaudible] and said, “Take it there – with diddle-a-diddle-a-da.” But I was trying last week, to say, “Now, take it over there, and it needs to be like – but, oh, what, like, whatever you—”</p>\n<p>JOHN: You see, the point is now – George – is we both did that to George, this time.</p>\n<p>PAUL: Mm.</p>\n<p>JOHN: And because of the build up to it, that – now he can’t even take that.</p>\n<p>PAUL: Treating him a bit like a mongrel, yeah.</p>\n<p>JOHN: He can’t even – you know. [audio glitch] It’s like if I say, “Alright, take it,” he’ll say, “Well, look, I can’t take it. I’ll forget it.”</p>\n<p>PAUL: Yeah…</p>\n<p>JOHN: I have to, uh—</p>\n<p>PAUL: ‘Cause he knows what we’re all about.</p>\n<p>JOHN: Yeah.</p>\n<p>PAUL: So he knows that when we say, “Take it,” we expect doo-doo-duh-duh-doo. If I said that, then you’d expect—</p>\n<p>JOHN: But it’s just that bit. The bit where we’ve – ‘I’ve Got A Feeling’.</p>\n<p>PAUL: Yeah.</p>\n<p>JOHN: We – there’s no way we could have translated it to him, to say… you know.</p>\n<h3 id=\"notes-15\">Notes</h3>\n<p>Brings George back into the heart of the Lennon–McCartney problem: both of them have conditioned him to expect a certain kind of “competent” playing, making it harder for him to accept even well-meant direction.</p>",{headings:4215,localImagePaths:4310,remoteImagePaths:4311,frontmatter:4312,imagePaths:4315},[4216,4217,4218,4219,4220,4221,4222,4223,4224,4225,4226,4227,4228,4229,4230,4231,4232,4233,4234,4235,4236,4237,4238,4239,4240,4241,4242,4243,4244,4245,4246,4247,4248,4250,4252,4254,4256,4258,4260,4262,4264,4266,4268,4270,4272,4274,4276,4278,4280,4281,4283,4285,4287,4289,4291,4293,4295,4297,4299,4301,4303,4304,4306,4308],{depth:89,slug:3605,text:3605},{depth:64,slug:1581,text:1582},{depth:64,slug:1799,text:3608},{depth:64,slug:3570,text:3571},{depth:89,slug:3611,text:3611},{depth:64,slug:3613,text:1582},{depth:64,slug:3615,text:3608},{depth:64,slug:3617,text:3571},{depth:89,slug:3619,text:3619},{depth:64,slug:3621,text:1582},{depth:64,slug:3623,text:3608},{depth:64,slug:3625,text:3571},{depth:89,slug:3664,text:3664},{depth:64,slug:3666,text:1582},{depth:64,slug:3668,text:3608},{depth:64,slug:3670,text:3571},{depth:89,slug:3672,text:3672},{depth:64,slug:3674,text:1582},{depth:64,slug:3676,text:3608},{depth:64,slug:3678,text:3571},{depth:89,slug:3843,text:3843},{depth:64,slug:3845,text:1582},{depth:64,slug:3847,text:3608},{depth:64,slug:3849,text:3571},{depth:89,slug:3851,text:3851},{depth:64,slug:3853,text:1582},{depth:64,slug:3855,text:3608},{depth:64,slug:3857,text:3571},{depth:89,slug:4021,text:4021},{depth:64,slug:4023,text:1582},{depth:64,slug:4025,text:3608},{depth:64,slug:4027,text:3571},{depth:89,slug:4249,text:4249},"9",{depth:64,slug:4251,text:1582},"overview-8",{depth:64,slug:4253,text:3608},"dialogue-8",{depth:64,slug:4255,text:3571},"notes-8",{depth:89,slug:4257,text:4257},"10",{depth:64,slug:4259,text:1582},"overview-9",{depth:64,slug:4261,text:3608},"dialogue-9",{depth:64,slug:4263,text:3571},"notes-9",{depth:89,slug:4265,text:4265},"11",{depth:64,slug:4267,text:1582},"overview-10",{depth:64,slug:4269,text:3608},"dialogue-10",{depth:64,slug:4271,text:3571},"notes-10",{depth:89,slug:4273,text:4273},"12",{depth:64,slug:4275,text:1582},"overview-11",{depth:64,slug:4277,text:3608},"dialogue-11",{depth:64,slug:4279,text:3571},"notes-11",{depth:89,slug:1809,text:1809},{depth:64,slug:4282,text:1582},"overview-12",{depth:64,slug:4284,text:3608},"dialogue-12",{depth:64,slug:4286,text:3571},"notes-12",{depth:89,slug:4288,text:4288},"14",{depth:64,slug:4290,text:1582},"overview-13",{depth:64,slug:4292,text:3608},"dialogue-13",{depth:64,slug:4294,text:3571},"notes-13",{depth:89,slug:4296,text:4296},"15",{depth:64,slug:4298,text:1582},"overview-14",{depth:64,slug:4300,text:3608},"dialogue-14",{depth:64,slug:4302,text:3571},"notes-14",{depth:89,slug:1812,text:1812},{depth:64,slug:4305,text:1582},"overview-15",{depth:64,slug:4307,text:3608},"dialogue-15",{depth:64,slug:4309,text:3571},"notes-15",[],[],{title:4204,category:1789,date_range:4205,source:1791,reliability:1792,relevance:1793,tags:4313,created:4314},[1431,1795,1796,1797,1798,1799,4207,3586,3587,3589,3588,3765,3592,3590,4077,4042],["Date","2025-12-19T00:00:00.000Z"],[],"get-back-dialogue-day-to-day/day-7-get-back.md","get-back-dialogue-day-to-day/day-8-get-back",{id:4317,data:4319,body:4326,filePath:4327,digest:4328,rendered:4329,legacyId:4371},{title:4320,category:1789,date_range:4321,source:1791,reliability:1792,relevance:1793,tags:4322,created:4325},"Get Back / Let It Be Sessions: Day 8 transcripts and notes","January 14, 1969",[1431,1795,1796,1797,1798,1799,4323,3586,3587,3588,3592,3590,4042,3722,4324],"1/14/1969","KEVIN",["Date","2025-12-19T00:00:00.000Z"],"## 1\r\n\r\n### Overview\r\n\r\nJanuary 14th, 1969 (Twickenham Film Studios, London): Paul plays work-in-progress 'The Back Seat Of My Car' for the first time in the studio.\r\n\r\n### Dialogue\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### Notes\r\n\r\nBrief reference only; no verbatim dialogue recorded for this performance.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 2\r\n\r\n### Overview\r\n\r\nJanuary 14th, 1969 (Twickenham Film Studios, London): Paul sings a song he's written (or is simply improvising on the spot) in the spirit of Johannes Brahms' 'Hungarian Dance No. 4' (and which was quite probably inspired by the 1947 film Song of Love, which features the piece).\r\n\r\n### Dialogue\r\n\r\nPAUL: It's just for you that I sing this song of winter / It's just for you that I sing a song of spring / And every time the raindrops fall I think of summer / It's just for you that I sing a song of love. \r\n\r\n### Notes\r\n\r\nShows Paul's improvisational instinct and his ability to evoke classical/romantic musical forms.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 3\r\n\r\n### Overview\r\n\r\nJanuary 14th, 1969 (Twickenham Film Studios, London): While John and Yoko are being interviewed by CBC, a bored Paul decides to have a go at climbing the chain/rope equipment in the studio. Ringo and Mal do likewise. When John and Yoko return, Paul encourages John to have a go as well; John bemoans that he's too old, and starts in on interviewing Paul and Ringo in a humorous imitation of the interview he just had.\r\n\r\n### Dialogue\r\n\r\nPAUL: Okay, John. Right up the chains, to the top. \r\n\r\nJOHN: Alright, Paul!\r\n\r\nPAUL: Come on, son, you can do it, son, I know you can do this, lad. [John attempts to climb] \r\n\r\nYOKO: John…\r\n\r\nPAUL: My money's on him. [John presumably falls] See! [general sounds of sympathy and laughter] \r\n\r\nYOKO: [sweet] You're not eighteen, you know. \r\n\r\nJOHN: No, no. [high-pitched voice] It's alright. Don't worry about a thing, Yoko.\r\n\r\nYOKO: He's not that young anymore, you see. [laughs] \r\n\r\nJOHN: No, I'm not eighteen anymore. I couldn't do it at bloody twelve, never mind… [Michael presumably helps out; to Michael] You're so kind. \r\n\r\nMICHAEL: Yeah, I'm courteous. [inaudible] \r\n\r\nJOHN: [pause; formal voice] Now, we were going to discuss, this afternoon, what religion meant to a pop star. And the pop star we've chosen is Ringo McCartney. Tell me, McCartney, does religion mean much to you in this present day, with all the trends and the swinging miniskirts that are about? [Yoko laughs] \r\n\r\nPAUL: Fuck all! Fuck all. \r\n\r\nJOHN: Well, I can see that's he's been disillusioned by the church in general in his remark of \"Fuck all.\" \r\n\r\nPAUL: Yeah well I went to, uh, Brighton with the Maharishi. Fuck all it meant to me! \r\n\r\nJOHN: Was it an important step to you?\r\n\r\nPAUL: Nothing, nothing. He didn't groove me. \r\n\r\nJOHN: He didn't groove.\r\n\r\nPAUL: No. \r\n\r\nJOHN: He didn't smoke pot, by any chance?\r\n\r\nPAUL: No. \r\n\r\nJOHN: What about the Reverend Nipples?\r\n\r\nPAUL: Not a chance. \r\n\r\nJOHN: Not a chance. [pause] Well, do you like \"X\"[-rated] films?\r\n\r\nPAUL: Yeah. Yeah. Lulu, Barry Ryan, and \"X\" films. But Maharishi – no. \r\n\r\nJOHN: That was a pretty concisive opinion of the youth of today. Now we're going on to a rather different group, uh, generation gap, and that's Tumble Starker! Who's sitting here. Now, what do you think about mock-Tudor shithouses in Weybridge and places like that? [Yoko laughs]\r\n\r\nRINGO: [posh voice] Well, I don't mind them being in Weybridge. It's just when they try and put them in London, I think they get in the way of all the traffic.\r\n\r\nJOHN: Yes, you're so right. As you said yesterday, \"Neither your arse nor your elbow.\"\r\n\r\nRINGO: [sage-like] I said that. \r\n\r\nJOHN: I couldn't – I'd never forget it. Well that's all for this evening. [hums broadcast theme tune] Hmm hmm hmm, hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm…\r\n\r\n### Notes\r\n\r\nPlayful mock interview showing the group's absurdist humour and their willingness to fill dead studio time with comedy routines. John's parodic interviewer voice is spot-on.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 4\r\n\r\n### Overview\r\n\r\nJanuary 14th, 1969 (Twickenham Studios): With George still out of the band, the rest of The Beatles loll around unproductively in the studio. Ringo casually suggests for John and Paul to write together again, just to fill the time. John (being John) answers in the form of a less-than-conspicuous ditty.\r\n\r\n### Dialogue\r\n\r\nRINGO: Yeah, why don't you get together—\r\n\r\nPAUL: [facetious] Yeah, are you interested at all? \r\n\r\nRINGO: —and write a song?\r\n\r\nPAUL: [laughs] Really, yeah. \r\n\r\nJOHN: Actually, I'd say I started one last night. It goes something like this. You are definitely inclined towards it… Although sometimes I doubt it… \r\n\r\nYOKO: What are you joking about? [laughs] \r\n\r\nJOHN: Just… doing my new number. \r\n\r\nMAL: Is that the middle eight?\r\n\r\nJOHN: That's the middle – I need a sort of chorus, and an outline. A format, to the, uh— \r\n\r\nPAUL: Common-garde. [general laughter]\r\n\r\n### Notes\r\n\r\nRingo's suggestion to \"write a song\" is met with John's cryptic improvisation, possibly about Paul or the partnership itself. Paul's \"common-garde\" quip is a typical deflection.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 5\r\n\r\n### Overview\r\n\r\nJanuary 14th, 1969 (Twickenham Film Studios, London): Hard pressed to work on any new material, the group (sans George) talk idly about producer Glyn Johns' ancestry, the train sets an unrelated production company is preparing for a film inside the studio, and the plans for the next day's sessions. John and Paul interview each other about their non-existent projects, skirt the issue of John's health, and communicate in alternations of absurdity and obscurity.\r\n\r\n### Dialogue\r\n\r\nJOHN: Who's the fool on the hill, Paul?\r\n\r\nPAUL: John. \r\n\r\nJOHN: [long pause] I'm trying to sell the house. [long pause] When I was young, so much younger than today, I never needed anybody's help, in any way. But now my life has changed in oh so many ways. A-whop-bop-a-luma… a-lim-bam-boom. [long pause] We should hold some sanctions against George. Very tightly. \r\n\r\nPAUL: Wheat. Coal.\r\n\r\nJOHN: Yes. Wheat and coal. Bread loaves. Meat biscuits. Cardboard cut-outs. \r\n\r\nPAUL: You see the Thirty-Minute Theatre? \r\n\r\nJOHN: I did, but in a blue fuzz. But it didn't get through to me. Nice colour, though. [pause] I had a visit from a hippie family. Wondered why I had so many bedrooms. \r\n\r\nPAUL: [long pause] Were you able to tell them?\r\n\r\nJOHN: Oh, yeah. I told them I've got a lot of bedrooms because I've got too many. And I offered them accommodation in Ireland, which they took up. \r\n\r\nPAUL: [long pause] Let's crack on. [sighs] \r\n\r\nMICHAEL: Who's got a match, as opposed to a lighter? \r\n\r\nPAUL: I have. \r\n\r\nJOHN: I have. \r\n\r\nMICHAEL: As opposed to a lighter. \r\n\r\nRINGO: A wooden one?\r\n\r\nPAUL: Blue gold?\r\n\r\nMICHAEL: A wooden one do, a wooden one not do… thank you. \r\n\r\nPAUL: I wooden wanna… \r\n\r\nMICHAEL: Are you [inaudible] John?\r\n\r\nGLYN: [laughs] No, I am not related. \r\n\r\nRINGO: Stratford John?\r\n\r\nGLYN: Nope. \r\n\r\nPAUL: Farmer John?\r\n\r\nGLYN: Augustus John, apparently. \r\n\r\nMICHAEL: The John. \r\n\r\nGLYN: Rumour has it Augustus John is a grandfather twice removed or something. [laughs] \r\n\r\nMICHAEL: That's the way with most of us offspring [inaudible]. \r\n\r\nPAUL: [referring to the film equipment] Is that the new trick, the playback speed is up there?\r\n\r\nRINGO: They've been there for several years. \r\n\r\nPAUL: Still feeding back. [laughs]\r\n\r\nMICHAEL: Should we knock off early today or not?\r\n\r\nPAUL: Probably, yeah. \r\n\r\nMICHAEL: Should we knock on early tomorrow?\r\n\r\nJOHN: Yes, I'll do that. \r\n\r\nPAUL: Knock on early?\r\n\r\nJOHN: Yes, I just uh… was up late, you know. \r\n\r\nPAUL: Yeah?\r\n\r\nMICHAEL: At the moment you're a guest for lunch. \r\n\r\nJOHN: I was sort of stoned and high and watching films and I wouldn't have made it anyway. And uh… \r\n\r\nPAUL: Check up. \r\n\r\nJOHN: [subdued] Yeah, but it's not good if – I'm gonna come at ten, I should come at ten, you know.  \r\n\r\nPAUL: Up with the dawn, down with the sun. \r\n\r\nJOHN: Mm. \r\n\r\nPAUL: Ringo ever, Eric never. \r\n\r\nYOKO: [referring to the previous night?] It was worthwhile, though, wasn't it?\r\n\r\nJOHN: Oh, it was worthwhile. [Paul and Yoko laugh] \r\n\r\nPAUL: Does he make a lot of fun of you, Yoko?\r\n\r\nYOKO: Not enough. [laughs] \r\n\r\nPAUL: Not enough. [John laughs] \r\n\r\nMICHAEL: I think they're painting the train. They'll be doing that while – whilst the time we're here. \r\n\r\nJOHN: We'd better get on before it leaves, then. \r\n\r\nPAUL: Please believe me. I'd hate to miss the train. Oh yeah. [pause] Like the shoes?\r\n\r\nYOKO: Is that the fashion?\r\n\r\nPAUL: This is the thing now, you know. \r\n\r\nYOKO: Mm. \r\n\r\nPAUL: The next thing. The socks are – the socks are with them, they come with them. \r\n\r\nJOHN: You did introduce oxford bogs, didn't you? [Paul and Yoko laugh]\r\n\r\nPAUL: Yeah, yeah. I am an innovator in many ways. \r\n\r\nJOHN: Well, apart from your part-time work, what are you doing?\r\n\r\nPAUL: Well, I do a lot of dramatic work, in and out of the country. \r\n\r\nJOHN: Presently, I'm working on a Welsh TV series called Land for Wecken, in which I appear as a Danish singer of royal blood who turned to folk singing after a disaster in the First World War where the Nazis bombed his house. \r\n\r\nPAUL: Mm. \r\n\r\nJOHN: And he had to move into, uh, Norway I think it was. Why, I was born on the train between Ostograd and Fensborough. \r\n\r\nPAUL: Jamaica?\r\n\r\nJOHN: Sometimes. [Ringo laughs] But generally I have a hell of a mi-graine. So I usually take uh, frantic, which usually gets rid of it. It dissolves in half the time, you see. [pause] It gave me a great background for the job I'm doing now. \r\n\r\nMICHAEL: It's funny – it's funny, really. The guy said to me, do you mind if they store their trains quietly in the back? And they've come totally populated with painters and the rest of them.\r\n\r\nJOHN: Now, the one thing you find about – we're not pushy. \r\n\r\nPAUL: No. \r\n\r\nJOHN: People want to put trains in the middle of our set— \r\n\r\nPAUL: —they get it. \r\n\r\nJOHN: [inaudible]\r\n\r\nPAUL: [pause] Yeah. Mind you, we're not mugs. \r\n\r\nJOHN: Oh no. \r\n\r\nPAUL: Oh no. \r\n\r\nJOHN: [referring to Apple] We gave it all away. It was our plan. \r\n\r\n### Notes\r\n\r\nDoug Sulpy describes John's voice here as having \"an interesting quality […] as if, wanting to say something serious for a change, he's forgotten quite how.\" The Beckett-like absurdism hides real tension about George's absence and the project's stagnation.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 6\r\n\r\n### Overview\r\n\r\nJanuary 14th, 1969 (Twickenham Film Studios, London): With John, Paul and the others present seemingly loathe to rehearse or work on new material, John improvises a scene based on an earlier discussion about filming a Beatles detective thriller story in the studio. When director Michael Lindsay-Hogg expresses concern about how they should handle George's walk-out in their proposed documentary of the sessions, John suggests their current state of boredom would make a far more compelling film. As Yoko returns from making a phone call, John hooks onto the topic of Robert Baden Powell's dissuasion of masturbation amongst the Boy Scouts.\r\n\r\n### Dialogue\r\n\r\nJOHN: Is Cilla Black? [Paul laughs] Read next week's TV Times… and you'll never know. [phone rings coincidentally in the studio] Ah! [Paul laughs; John pretends to hold a phone conversation] Sir Joseph. It's about this deal with FBI. I need another million and the written acclimation of Dick James. [pause] I know it's hard, I know it's hard! But you're in position to do it, George.\r\n\r\nMICHAEL: We were talking, earlier—\r\n\r\nJOHN: About the space between us?\r\n\r\nMICHAEL: [laughs] About the gap between us. But about also like the documentary, which is grinding to a halt. How we'd do it.\r\n\r\nJOHN: Grinding to a halt? I think it's taking off.\r\n\r\nPAUL: [laughs] Taking— Here we go.\r\n\r\nJOHN: \"Loop the loop,\" as Frankie once said, the one-legged wonder.\r\n\r\nMICHAEL: Ringo said that he thought we ought to just tell it like it is, which is what I thought, but Mal thought we oughtn't tell it like it is.\r\n\r\nPAUL: I think we are.\r\n\r\nMICHAEL: I think we are.\r\n\r\nJOHN: Well uh…\r\n\r\nMICHAEL: So those are the two camps, you might say, which goes back to the remark you were making earlier about Noël Coward.\r\n\r\nJOHN: [facetious] Well I do object to all this camp on TV, including Baden Powell on his foreskin. It's one of the most upsetting things I've ever seen. Discouraging boys from masturbating in case he wets the sheets. [laughter] It's funny you should say that. [Yoko returns]\r\n\r\nYOKO: What are you talking about?\r\n\r\nJOHN: I'm talking about the Boy Scouts who aren't allowed to masturbate.\r\n\r\nYOKO: Oh.\r\n\r\nJOHN: It's very tempting when you're wearing shorts. If they only wore long trousers, maybe they'd stand a chance, you know. But I can tell you, you don't go blind, but very short-sighted. [uproarious laughter]\r\n\r\nYOKO: Are you talking from experience, or just…?\r\n\r\nJOHN: From experience. [laughter] I remember during an English lesson, as I came, I suddenly noticed I needed glasses. I thought, \"God, they were right.\" But I'm not gonna give it up for anything! [Yoko laughs] All the tax I've earned. I should coco. [silence] We should dub on a spiritual message of that. [Paul and Yoko laugh]\r\n\r\n### Notes\r\n\r\nJohn's \"taking off\" vs. Michael's \"grinding to a halt\" perfectly captures the divergent views of the documentary's direction. The Baden Powell riff is classic Lennon shock humour.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 7\r\n\r\n### Overview\r\n\r\nJanuary 14th, 1969 (Twickenham Film Studios, London): As the day trudges forth without any productivity for the Beatles' second day without George in the group, Paul asks John about Two Virgins (under the flippant guise of a journalist) to which John responds with stiff sincerity. As director Michael Lindsay-Hogg comes round to confer, Ringo admits that he isn't feeling well and wonders about having some rest. Michael commiserates, but expresses concern about the impetus of the group and is worried that they will individually (and indifferently) wander off to their own devices if they don't have a routine schedule to solder them together as a working band – which prompts John and Ringo to sing a sentimental folk bar. Not being of the disposition to have serious discussions about the direction of the (Get Back/Let It Be) sessions, John, Paul, and Ringo (dis)engage in frivolous wit and references to the Laugh-In.\r\n\r\n### Dialogue\r\n\r\nPAUL: So what's the point behind Two Virgins? [Yoko laughs]\r\n\r\nJOHN: It's a six-inch nail. [long pause] The main point behind it is to open people's minds to what's happening today. There are people all over the country humming into tape recorders, and we hope to bring them out into the open. And hum together. [pause] You understand?\r\n\r\nPAUL: Hmm.\r\n\r\nJOHN: Now sold one thousand three hundred due to the great promotion from Apple Dietetics.\r\n\r\nYOKO: [laughs] Which is a figure you don't want to expose, necessarily.\r\n\r\nPAUL: Is it very neat to do this in public, Mr. Lennon?\r\n\r\nJOHN: I feel obliged, in the position that I am today as a pop idol and the power I have, to do something for the good, and uh, I feel obliged to speak out… [pause] And that's as simple as I can put it, really. Take Downing Street. South Orderly Street. Wimpole Street. All owned by the Queen. 'Nuff said. [silence; fidgeting]\r\n\r\nMAL: [in background] Is anybody – wanna rehearse, or do songs, or—?\r\n\r\nYOKO: [inaudible]\r\n\r\nRINGO: I feel ill, actually.\r\n\r\nMICHAEL: Do you? Was this a mistake [inaudible]?\r\n\r\nRINGO: I don't. [laughter]\r\n\r\nJOHN: I think a few days in bed…\r\n\r\nRINGO: Yes, I think so too.\r\n\r\nJOHN: Or maybe three days on the couch, depending on what your job is.\r\n\r\nRINGO: I think two days in bed.\r\n\r\nMICHAEL: Do you really not feel well?\r\n\r\nRINGO: No, I just feel a bit… ill.\r\n\r\nPAUL: [to Michael] Well, do you?\r\n\r\nMICHAEL: I don't feel well, but I can't say, 'cause I'm the captain of the ship.\r\n\r\nJOHN: Oh you can. [Yoko laughs]\r\n\r\nPAUL: Why?\r\n\r\nMICHAEL: No, I don't want to let the crew down.\r\n\r\nJOHN: Nowadays, the captain gets off first.\r\n\r\nMICHAEL: No, I go down with the ship.\r\n\r\nYOKO: [inaudible]\r\n\r\nJOHN: No he does, really.\r\n\r\nMICHAEL: I feel tired, but I think it's tiring – disappointing.\r\n\r\nJOHN: [bored] Hmm.\r\n\r\nMICHAEL: But I have a feeling if we decide not to meet one day, we may never meet again.\r\n\r\nPAUL: Well…\r\n\r\nJOHN: Along this dusty road…\r\n\r\nRINGO: We'll always meet again…\r\n\r\nJOHN: On this dusty road.\r\n\r\nYOKO: As they say, there's no business like no business.\r\n\r\nJOHN: Again.\r\n\r\nPAUL: Yeah.\r\n\r\nYOKO: Again.\r\n\r\nPAUL: And still the boom [mic] wasn't over them.\r\n\r\nJOHN: Ooh, the Queen of Sheba wore falsies.\r\n\r\nRINGO: [mock-surprise] I didn't know that!\r\n\r\nJOHN: Didn't you know that? You weren't there at the time. [pause] Cleopatra was a carpet manufacturer.\r\n\r\nRINGO: I didn't know that!\r\n\r\nJOHN: 'Cause you weren't there at the time. [pause] Edgar Allen Poe was a shithouse.\r\n\r\nRINGO: I didn't know that!\r\n\r\nYOKO: What was John Lennon?\r\n\r\nJOHN: A patriot. [Yoko laughs] I didn't know that. [laughter]\r\n\r\nJOHN & PAUL: \"Goodnight, Dick.\" [laughter]\r\n\r\nJOHN: [sighs] That was Lennon and McCartney. Northern Sheds. Great Western Railway.\r\n\r\nPAUL: Songs for all functions.\r\n\r\nJOHN: Ross-Upon-Wye.\r\n\r\nPAUL: Nige-Whalley-Mange.\r\n\r\nJOHN: Ilford two, Western Middlodeons – terrible.\r\n\r\n### Notes\r\n\r\nMichael's \"if we decide not to meet one day, we may never meet again\" is met with a sentimental folk duet from John and Ringo, then more absurdist comedy. Yoko's \"no business like no business\" is perfectly placed.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 8\r\n\r\n### Overview\r\n\r\nJanuary 14th, 1969 (Twickenham Film Studios, London): As Paul jokingly suggests for the camera crew to capture Ringo (who isn't feeling well) if he sicks on the floor, John mentions superficially that he threw up during an interview filmed earlier in the day with Yoko for Canadian television – not from illness, but from recent irresponsible habits, possibly exercised the previous night. Paul, who is wearied by the lethargy of the proceedings, tries to engage John about the recording sessions and how they should work while George is gone, but John palters, and at turns they both fall back on oblique references and emotionally indeterminate allusions.\r\n\r\nAfter John trades bad jokes with Ringo, Paul implores them to remember why they're here and that they can't idle forever, and John (seemingly contrite, if nonetheless facile) agrees to start rehearsing. Despite the others' reservations about his health, a subdued Ringo reassures that he's staying to play too.\r\n\r\n### Dialogue\r\n\r\nRINGO: Kevin?\r\n\r\nPAUL: I think if we hang around a bit longer we can get Ringo being sick. [laughter]\r\n\r\nJOHN: You – see, you missed me this morning, I did it for CBS. Just leapt off in the middle of the interview.\r\n\r\nPAUL: Did you?\r\n\r\nKEVIN: [in background] As a matter of fact, yes.\r\n\r\nJOHN: No reason at all, except that I've been mistreating my body.\r\n\r\nYOKO: I thought it was a happening.\r\n\r\nJOHN: It was a happening.\r\n\r\nPAUL: There was a lot of nervous tension, you know.\r\n\r\nJOHN: Oh, yes.\r\n\r\nPAUL: I mean, there was a bloody funny atmosphere in that room, mother.\r\n\r\nJOHN: Aye.\r\n\r\nMICHAEL: We missed out on the other day.\r\n\r\nJOHN: Hmm?\r\n\r\nMICHAEL: We missed it the other day, but then they wouldn't let us have it.\r\n\r\nJOHN: They missed it too.\r\n\r\nMICHAEL: Oh. Were they in colour or black and white?\r\n\r\nYOKO: Colour.\r\n\r\nJOHN: I never noticed that. Colour.\r\n\r\nPAUL: [trying] See, what we need is a serious program of work. An endeavour. Not an aimless rambling amongst the canyons of your mind. [inaudible] —life.\r\n\r\nJOHN: Take me on that trip upon that golden ship of shores… We're all together, boy.\r\n\r\nPAUL: To wander aimlessly is very unswinging. Unhip.\r\n\r\nJOHN: And when I touch you, I feel happy inside. I can't hide, I can't hide. [pause] Ask me why, I'll say I love you.\r\n\r\nPAUL: What we need is a schedule.\r\n\r\nJOHN: A garden schedule.\r\n\r\nPAUL: Point A to Z. Travel to A to Z, and having reached the point – take a holiday.\r\n\r\nJOHN: It's holiday time.\r\n\r\nPAUL: Achieve something, everyday. [pause]\r\n\r\nYOKO: It's a hell of a lot to ask for…\r\n\r\nJOHN: That's sort of hard to live up to, Paul.\r\n\r\nPAUL: [very quiet] It's very hard to live up to.\r\n\r\nMICHAEL: Ernest Hemingway had a very good remark about that, which I've unfortunately forgotten. About achieving something everyday. It's the only thing of his writings I like.\r\n\r\nPAUL: It may in theory sound silly, but—\r\n\r\nJOHN: In practice…\r\n\r\nPAUL: —it's even sillier. Well, if practice is all there is.\r\n\r\nJOHN: This is where it's at.\r\n\r\nPAUL: This is where it's at, unless that is where it's at.\r\n\r\nJOHN: This is where it's at, now.\r\n\r\nPAUL: Mm-hmm. [long pause] Teamwork. A good defense. And a line of forwards. A good strong pair of boots.\r\n\r\nYOKO: [inaudible]\r\n\r\nJOHN: You play ball with me, and I'll play ball with you.\r\n\r\nPAUL: Don't swing the lead, sonny.\r\n\r\nJOHN: Every cloud have a silver mouth boat.\r\n\r\nPAUL: Could be learning something instead of this, you know.\r\n\r\nJOHN: Bob Newridges is a tartan that covers Yorkshire.\r\n\r\nPAUL: Rutland is the smallest county.\r\n\r\nJOHN: Scarborough is a college scarf.\r\n\r\nPAUL: Amo amas a minge.\r\n\r\nJOHN: [laughs] Amanty meaty monkey monk… [Paul laughs]\r\n\r\nYOKO: [to Michael] Are we going to see the rushes, or—?\r\n\r\nPAUL: This is the – this is the typical end-product of an actor's career.\r\n\r\nJOHN: Alexander the Great was a bighead. Or a fireplace. [long pause] Why do they call it Great Britain? How long is it going to go on? Fantastic France. Amazing America.\r\n\r\nPAUL: Huge Spain.\r\n\r\nJOHN: [laughs] Huge Spain. I'll drink to that. [pause] When is a door not a door?\r\n\r\nRINGO: I don't know.\r\n\r\nJOHN: When it's ajar.\r\n\r\nPAUL: When it's ajar.\r\n\r\nRINGO: Two flies on a door. Which one was sick?\r\n\r\nJOHN: I don't know.\r\n\r\nRINGO: The one on the panel.\r\n\r\nJOHN: I don't blame it. [pause] Why did the chickie cross the road?\r\n\r\nPAUL: You see what you've done to us, pal?\r\n\r\nRINGO: To get to the other side.\r\n\r\nJOHN: You've heard it before!\r\n\r\nRINGO: Yes.\r\n\r\nJOHN: Clichés…\r\n\r\nRINGO: What goes over water, under water, and never gets wet?\r\n\r\nJOHN: Hmm… a rubber mac.\r\n\r\nRINGO: No, an egg in a duck's belly.\r\n\r\nPAUL: [cutting in] Now, alright, we can't carry on like this indefinitely now, can we?\r\n\r\nRINGO: I beg you?\r\n\r\nPAUL: We can't carry on like this indefinitely.\r\n\r\nJOHN: Doing this?\r\n\r\nRINGO: We seem to be.\r\n\r\nPAUL: We seem to, but we can't. Because our hearts are—\r\n\r\nJOHN: Should we go play our group, then?\r\n\r\nPAUL: There's the other point.\r\n\r\nJOHN: I think this is rather good.\r\n\r\nPAUL: It's alright, I must say, but we can't carry on like this indefinitely.\r\n\r\nJOHN: As some clips in between.\r\n\r\nPAUL: Yeah.\r\n\r\nJOHN: [pause] As I said, I'm just recovering from the day, you know…\r\n\r\nPAUL: Dyspepsia.\r\n\r\nYOKO: From the night, frankly.\r\n\r\nJOHN: [stage whisper] Oh, don't say that, you're be revealings!\r\n\r\nYOKO: [laughs] Oh… I didn't think about that.\r\n\r\nJOHN: \"From the night\", indeed. Next thing you'll be telling them about our black sheets! [laughter] Enriched with Marylebone Station… [fidgeting; gets up] Right. [to Paul] Guitars? I thought that's what they do.\r\n\r\nPAUL: That is what they do, but if you're singing—\r\n\r\nJOHN: Oh, I'll even sing you half a song I was writing.\r\n\r\nPAUL: [gets up; to Ringo] C'mon. Sounds. How's – how's about?\r\n\r\nRINGO: [subdued] Sound city… Yes, go on, I'll come.\r\n\r\nPAUL: [concerned] How are you feeling?\r\n\r\nRINGO: No, I just feel a bit off. Very—\r\n\r\nPAUL: [joking; bleak] Last two years, actually.\r\n\r\nRINGO: [laughs] No, it's not that. It's just that some days— [inaudible; drowned out by voice marking slate] —you don't know how you feel.\r\n\r\n### Notes\r\n\r\nKevin Harrington is one of the production runners. The phrase \"canyons of your mind\" references The Bonzo Dog Doo Dah Band. Doug Sulpy describes John and Paul's exchange as \"a duel of witticisms.\" During this period John was using heroin, which is the most probable cause—directly or indirectly—for his vomiting. Paul's repeated \"we can't carry on like this indefinitely\" finally breaks through the absurdist fog, and they reluctantly agree to rehearse.","src/content/research/get-back-dialogue-day-to-day/day-8-get-back.md","b9940a536ec0d5ed",{html:4330,metadata:4331},"<h2 id=\"1\">1</h2>\n<h3 id=\"overview\">Overview</h3>\n<p>January 14th, 1969 (Twickenham Film Studios, London): Paul plays work-in-progress ‘The Back Seat Of My Car’ for the first time in the studio.</p>\n<h3 id=\"dialogue\">Dialogue</h3>\n<p>N/A</p>\n<h3 id=\"notes\">Notes</h3>\n<p>Brief reference only; no verbatim dialogue recorded for this performance.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"2\">2</h2>\n<h3 id=\"overview-1\">Overview</h3>\n<p>January 14th, 1969 (Twickenham Film Studios, London): Paul sings a song he’s written (or is simply improvising on the spot) in the spirit of Johannes Brahms’ ‘Hungarian Dance No. 4’ (and which was quite probably inspired by the 1947 film Song of Love, which features the piece).</p>\n<h3 id=\"dialogue-1\">Dialogue</h3>\n<p>PAUL: It’s just for you that I sing this song of winter / It’s just for you that I sing a song of spring / And every time the raindrops fall I think of summer / It’s just for you that I sing a song of love.</p>\n<h3 id=\"notes-1\">Notes</h3>\n<p>Shows Paul’s improvisational instinct and his ability to evoke classical/romantic musical forms.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"3\">3</h2>\n<h3 id=\"overview-2\">Overview</h3>\n<p>January 14th, 1969 (Twickenham Film Studios, London): While John and Yoko are being interviewed by CBC, a bored Paul decides to have a go at climbing the chain/rope equipment in the studio.

[laughs]</p>\n<p>MICHAEL: That’s the way with most of us offspring [inaudible].</p>\n<p>PAUL: [referring to the film equipment] Is that the new trick, the playback speed is up there?</p>\n<p>RINGO: They’ve been there for several years.</p>\n<p>PAUL: Still feeding back. [laughs]</p>\n<p>MICHAEL: Should we knock off early today or not?</p>\n<p>PAUL: Probably, yeah.</p>\n<p>MICHAEL: Should we knock on early tomorrow?</p>\n<p>JOHN: Yes, I’ll do that.</p>\n<p>PAUL: Knock on early?</p>\n<p>JOHN: Yes, I just uh… was up late, you know.</p>\n<p>PAUL: Yeah?</p>\n<p>MICHAEL: At the moment you’re a guest for lunch.</p>\n<p>JOHN: I was sort of stoned and high and watching films and I wouldn’t have made it anyway. And uh…</p>\n<p>PAUL: Check up.</p>\n<p>JOHN: [subdued] Yeah, but it’s not good if – I’m gonna come at ten, I should come at ten, you know.</p>\n<p>PAUL: Up with the dawn, down with the sun.</p>\n<p>JOHN: Mm.</p>\n<p>PAUL: Ringo ever, Eric never.</p>\n<p>YOKO: [referring to the previous night?] It was worthwhile, though, wasn’t it?</p>\n<p>JOHN: Oh, it was worthwhile. [Paul and Yoko laugh]</p>\n<p>PAUL: Does he make a lot of fun of you, Yoko?</p>\n<p>YOKO: Not enough. [laughs]</p>\n<p>PAUL: Not enough. [John laughs]</p>\n<p>MICHAEL: I think they’re painting the train. They’ll be doing that while – whilst the time we’re here.</p>\n<p>JOHN: We’d better get on before it leaves, then.</p>\n<p>PAUL: Please believe me. I’d hate to miss the train. Oh yeah. [pause] Like the shoes?</p>\n<p>YOKO: Is that the fashion?</p>\n<p>PAUL: This is the thing now, you know.</p>\n<p>YOKO: Mm.</p>\n<p>PAUL: The next thing. The socks are – the socks are with them, they come with them.</p>\n<p>JOHN: You did introduce oxford bogs, didn’t you? [Paul and Yoko laugh]</p>\n<p>PAUL: Yeah, yeah. I am an innovator in many ways.</p>\n<p>JOHN: Well, apart from your part-time work, what are you doing?</p>\n<p>PAUL: Well, I do a lot of dramatic work, in and out of the country.</p>\n<p>JOHN: Presently, I’m working on a Welsh TV series called Land for Wecken, in which I appear as a Danish singer of royal blood who turned to folk singing after a disaster in the First World War where the Nazis bombed his house.</p>\n<p>PAUL: Mm.</p>\n<p>JOHN: And he had to move into, uh, Norway I think it was. Why, I was born on the train between Ostograd and Fensborough.</p>\n<p>PAUL: Jamaica?</p>\n<p>JOHN: Sometimes. [Ringo laughs] But generally I have a hell of a mi-graine. So I usually take uh, frantic, which usually gets rid of it. It dissolves in half the time, you see. [pause] It gave me a great background for the job I’m doing now.</p>\n<p>MICHAEL: It’s funny – it’s funny, really. The guy said to me, do you mind if they store their trains quietly in the back? And they’ve come totally populated with painters and the rest of them.</p>\n<p>JOHN: Now, the one thing you find about – we’re not pushy.</p>\n<p>PAUL: No.</p>\n<p>JOHN: People want to put trains in the middle of our set—</p>\n<p>PAUL: —they get it.</p>\n<p>JOHN: [inaudible]</p>\n<p>PAUL: [pause] Yeah. Mind you, we’re not mugs.</p>\n<p>JOHN: Oh no.</p>\n<p>PAUL: Oh no.</p>\n<p>JOHN: [referring to Apple] We gave it all away. It was our plan.</p>\n<h3 id=\"notes-4\">Notes</h3>\n<p>Doug Sulpy describes John’s voice here as having “an interesting quality […] as if, wanting to say something serious for a change, he’s forgotten quite how.” The Beckett-like absurdism hides real tension about George’s absence and the project’s stagnation.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"6\">6</h2>\n<h3 id=\"overview-5\">Overview</h3>\n<p>January 14th, 1969 (Twickenham Film Studios, London): With John, Paul and the others present seemingly loathe to rehearse or work on new material, John improvises a scene based on an earlier discussion about filming a Beatles detective thriller story in the studio. When director Michael Lindsay-Hogg expresses concern about how they should handle George’s walk-out in their proposed documentary of the sessions, John suggests their current state of boredom would make a far more compelling film. As Yoko returns from making a phone call, John hooks onto the topic of Robert Baden Powell’s dissuasion of masturbation amongst the Boy Scouts.</p>\n<h3 id=\"dialogue-5\">Dialogue</h3>\n<p>JOHN: Is Cilla Black? [Paul laughs] Read next week’s TV Times… and you’ll never know. [phone rings coincidentally in the studio] Ah! [Paul laughs; John pretends to hold a phone conversation] Sir Joseph. It’s about this deal with FBI. I need another million and the written acclimation of Dick James. [pause] I know it’s hard, I know it’s hard! But you’re in position to do it, George.</p>\n<p>MICHAEL: We were talking, earlier—</p>\n<p>JOHN: About the space between us?</p>\n<p>MICHAEL: [laughs] About the gap between us. But about also like the documentary, which is grinding to a halt. How we’d do it.</p>\n<p>JOHN: Grinding to a halt? I think it’s taking off.</p>\n<p>PAUL: [laughs] Taking— Here we go.</p>\n<p>JOHN: “Loop the loop,” as Frankie once said, the one-legged wonder.</p>\n<p>MICHAEL: Ringo said that he thought we ought to just tell it like it is, which is what I thought, but Mal thought we oughtn’t tell it like it is.</p>\n<p>PAUL: I think we are.</p>\n<p>MICHAEL: I think we are.</p>\n<p>JOHN: Well uh…</p>\n<p>MICHAEL: So those are the two camps, you might say, which goes back to the remark you were making earlier about Noël Coward.</p>\n<p>JOHN: [facetious] Well I do object to all this camp on TV, including Baden Powell on his foreskin. It’s one of the most upsetting things I’ve ever seen. Discouraging boys from masturbating in case he wets the sheets. [laughter] It’s funny you should say that. [Yoko returns]</p>\n<p>YOKO: What are you talking about?</p>\n<p>JOHN: I’m talking about the Boy Scouts who aren’t allowed to masturbate.</p>\n<p>YOKO: Oh.</p>\n<p>JOHN: It’s very tempting when you’re wearing shorts. If they only wore long trousers, maybe they’d stand a chance, you know. But I can tell you, you don’t go blind, but very short-sighted. [uproarious laughter]</p>\n<p>YOKO: Are you talking from experience, or just…?</p>\n<p>JOHN: From experience. [laughter] I remember during an English lesson, as I came, I suddenly noticed I needed glasses. I thought, “God, they were right.” But I’m not gonna give it up for anything! [Yoko laughs] All the tax I’ve earned. I should coco. [silence] We should dub on a spiritual message of that. [Paul and Yoko laugh]</p>\n<h3 id=\"notes-5\">Notes</h3>\n<p>John’s “taking off” vs. Michael’s “grinding to a halt” perfectly captures the divergent views of the documentary’s direction. The Baden Powell riff is classic Lennon shock humour.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"7\">7</h2>\n<h3 id=\"overview-6\">Overview</h3>\n<p>January 14th, 1969 (Twickenham Film Studios, London): As the day trudges forth without any productivity for the Beatles’ second day without George in the group, Paul asks John about Two Virgins (under the flippant guise of a journalist) to which John responds with stiff sincerity. As director Michael Lindsay-Hogg comes round to confer, Ringo admits that he isn’t feeling well and wonders about having some rest. Michael commiserates, but expresses concern about the impetus of the group and is worried that they will individually (and indifferently) wander off to their own devices if they don’t have a routine schedule to solder them together as a working band – which prompts John and Ringo to sing a sentimental folk bar. Not being of the disposition to have serious discussions about the direction of the (Get Back/Let It Be) sessions, John, Paul, and Ringo (dis)engage in frivolous wit and references to the Laugh-In.</p>\n<h3 id=\"dialogue-6\">Dialogue</h3>\n<p>PAUL: So what’s the point behind Two Virgins? [Yoko laughs]</p>\n<p>JOHN: It’s a six-inch nail. [long pause] The main point behind it is to open people’s minds to what’s happening today. There are people all over the country humming into tape recorders, and we hope to bring them out into the open. And hum together. [pause] You understand?</p>\n<p>PAUL: Hmm.</p>\n<p>JOHN: Now sold one thousand three hundred due to the great promotion from Apple Dietetics.</p>\n<p>YOKO: [laughs] Which is a figure you don’t want to expose, necessarily.</p>\n<p>PAUL: Is it very neat to do this in public, Mr. Lennon?</p>\n<p>JOHN: I feel obliged, in the position that I am today as a pop idol and the power I have, to do something for the good, and uh, I feel obliged to speak out… [pause] And that’s as simple as I can put it, really. Take Downing Street. South Orderly Street. Wimpole Street. All owned by the Queen. ‘Nuff said. [silence; fidgeting]</p>\n<p>MAL: [in background] Is anybody – wanna rehearse, or do songs, or—?</p>\n<p>YOKO: [inaudible]</p>\n<p>RINGO: I feel ill, actually.</p>\n<p>MICHAEL: Do you? Was this a mistake [inaudible]?</p>\n<p>RINGO: I don’t. [laughter]</p>\n<p>JOHN: I think a few days in bed…</p>\n<p>RINGO: Yes, I think so too.</p>\n<p>JOHN: Or maybe three days on the couch, depending on what your job is.</p>\n<p>RINGO: I think two days in bed.</p>\n<p>MICHAEL: Do you really not feel well?</p>\n<p>RINGO: No, I just feel a bit… ill.</p>\n<p>PAUL: [to Michael] Well, do you?</p>\n<p>MICHAEL: I don’t feel well, but I can’t say, ‘cause I’m the captain of the ship.</p>\n<p>JOHN: Oh you can. [Yoko laughs]</p>\n<p>PAUL: Why?</p>\n<p>MICHAEL: No, I don’t want to let the crew down.</p>\n<p>JOHN: Nowadays, the captain gets off first.</p>\n<p>MICHAEL: No, I go down with the ship.</p>\n<p>YOKO: [inaudible]</p>\n<p>JOHN: No he does, really.</p>\n<p>MICHAEL: I feel tired, but I think it’s tiring – disappointing.</p>\n<p>JOHN: [bored] Hmm.</p>\n<p>MICHAEL: But I have a feeling if we decide not to meet one day, we may never meet again.</p>\n<p>PAUL: Well…</p>\n<p>JOHN: Along this dusty road…</p>\n<p>RINGO: We’ll always meet again…</p>\n<p>JOHN: On this dusty road.</p>\n<p>YOKO: As they say, there’s no business like no business.</p>\n<p>JOHN: Again.</p>\n<p>PAUL: Yeah.</p>\n<p>YOKO: Again.</p>\n<p>PAUL: And still the boom [mic] wasn’t over them.</p>\n<p>JOHN: Ooh, the Queen of Sheba wore falsies.</p>\n<p>RINGO: [mock-surprise] I didn’t know that!</p>\n<p>JOHN: Didn’t you know that? You weren’t there at the time. [pause] Cleopatra was a carpet manufacturer.</p>\n<p>RINGO: I didn’t know that!</p>\n<p>JOHN: ‘Cause you weren’t there at the time. [pause] Edgar Allen Poe was a shithouse.</p>\n<p>RINGO: I didn’t know that!</p>\n<p>YOKO: What was John Lennon?</p>\n<p>JOHN: A patriot. [Yoko laughs] I didn’t know that. [laughter]</p>\n<p>JOHN &#x26; PAUL: “Goodnight, Dick.” [laughter]</p>\n<p>JOHN: [sighs] That was Lennon and McCartney. Northern Sheds. Great Western Railway.</p>\n<p>PAUL: Songs for all functions.</p>\n<p>JOHN: Ross-Upon-Wye.</p>\n<p>PAUL: Nige-Whalley-Mange.</p>\n<p>JOHN: Ilford two, Western Middlodeons – terrible.</p>\n<h3 id=\"notes-6\">Notes</h3>\n<p>Michael’s “if we decide not to meet one day, we may never meet again” is met with a sentimental folk duet from John and Ringo, then more absurdist comedy. Yoko’s “no business like no business” is perfectly placed.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"8\">8</h2>\n<h3 id=\"overview-7\">Overview</h3>\n<p>January 14th, 1969 (Twickenham Film Studios, London): As Paul jokingly suggests for the camera crew to capture Ringo (who isn’t feeling well) if he sicks on the floor, John mentions superficially that he threw up during an interview filmed earlier in the day with Yoko for Canadian television – not from illness, but from recent irresponsible habits, possibly exercised the previous night. Paul, who is wearied by the lethargy of the proceedings, tries to engage John about the recording sessions and how they should work while George is gone, but John palters, and at turns they both fall back on oblique references and emotionally indeterminate allusions.</p>\n<p>After John trades bad jokes with Ringo, Paul implores them to remember why they’re here and that they can’t idle forever, and John (seemingly contrite, if nonetheless facile) agrees to start rehearsing. Despite the others’ reservations about his health, a subdued Ringo reassures that he’s staying to play too.</p>\n<h3 id=\"dialogue-7\">Dialogue</h3>\n<p>RINGO: Kevin?</p>\n<p>PAUL: I think if we hang around a bit longer we can get Ringo being sick. [laughter]</p>\n<p>JOHN: You – see, you missed me this morning, I did it for CBS. Just leapt off in the middle of the interview.</p>\n<p>PAUL: Did you?</p>\n<p>KEVIN: [in background] As a matter of fact, yes.</p>\n<p>JOHN: No reason at all, except that I’ve been mistreating my body.</p>\n<p>YOKO: I thought it was a happening.</p>\n<p>JOHN: It was a happening.</p>\n<p>PAUL: There was a lot of nervous tension, you know.</p>\n<p>JOHN: Oh, yes.</p>\n<p>PAUL: I mean, there was a bloody funny atmosphere in that room, mother.</p>\n<p>JOHN: Aye.</p>\n<p>MICHAEL: We missed out on the other day.</p>\n<p>JOHN: Hmm?</p>\n<p>MICHAEL: We missed it the other day, but then they wouldn’t let us have it.</p>\n<p>JOHN: They missed it too.</p>\n<p>MICHAEL: Oh. Were they in colour or black and white?</p>\n<p>YOKO: Colour.</p>\n<p>JOHN: I never noticed that. Colour.</p>\n<p>PAUL: [trying] See, what we need is a serious program of work. An endeavour. Not an aimless rambling amongst the canyons of your mind. [inaudible] —life.</p>\n<p>JOHN: Take me on that trip upon that golden ship of shores… We’re all together, boy.</p>\n<p>PAUL: To wander aimlessly is very unswinging. Unhip.</p>\n<p>JOHN: And when I touch you, I feel happy inside. I can’t hide, I can’t hide. [pause] Ask me why, I’ll say I love you.</p>\n<p>PAUL: What we need is a schedule.</p>\n<p>JOHN: A garden schedule.</p>\n<p>PAUL: Point A to Z. Travel to A to Z, and having reached the point – take a holiday.</p>\n<p>JOHN: It’s holiday time.</p>\n<p>PAUL: Achieve something, everyday. [pause]</p>\n<p>YOKO: It’s a hell of a lot to ask for…</p>\n<p>JOHN: That’s sort of hard to live up to, Paul.</p>\n<p>PAUL: [very quiet] It’s very hard to live up to.</p>\n<p>MICHAEL: Ernest Hemingway had a very good remark about that, which I’ve unfortunately forgotten. About achieving something everyday. It’s the only thing of his writings I like.</p>\n<p>PAUL: It may in theory sound silly, but—</p>\n<p>JOHN: In practice…</p>\n<p>PAUL: —it’s even sillier. Well, if practice is all there is.</p>\n<p>JOHN: This is where it’s at.</p>\n<p>PAUL: This is where it’s at, unless that is where it’s at.</p>\n<p>JOHN: This is where it’s at, now.</p>\n<p>PAUL: Mm-hmm. [long pause] Teamwork. A good defense. And a line of forwards. A good strong pair of boots.</p>\n<p>YOKO: [inaudible]</p>\n<p>JOHN: You play ball with me, and I’ll play ball with you.</p>\n<p>PAUL: Don’t swing the lead, sonny.</p>\n<p>JOHN: Every cloud have a silver mouth boat.</p>\n<p>PAUL: Could be learning something instead of this, you know.</p>\n<p>JOHN: Bob Newridges is a tartan that covers Yorkshire.</p>\n<p>PAUL: Rutland is the smallest county.</p>\n<p>JOHN: Scarborough is a college scarf.</p>\n<p>PAUL: Amo amas a minge.</p>\n<p>JOHN: [laughs] Amanty meaty monkey monk… [Paul laughs]</p>\n<p>YOKO: [to Michael] Are we going to see the rushes, or—?</p>\n<p>PAUL: This is the – this is the typical end-product of an actor’s career.</p>\n<p>JOHN: Alexander the Great was a bighead. Or a fireplace. [long pause] Why do they call it Great Britain? How long is it going to go on? Fantastic France. Amazing America.</p>\n<p>PAUL: Huge Spain.</p>\n<p>JOHN: [laughs] Huge Spain. I’ll drink to that. [pause] When is a door not a door?</p>\n<p>RINGO: I don’t know.</p>\n<p>JOHN: When it’s ajar.</p>\n<p>PAUL: When it’s ajar.</p>\n<p>RINGO: Two flies on a door. Which one was sick?</p>\n<p>JOHN: I don’t know.</p>\n<p>RINGO: The one on the panel.</p>\n<p>JOHN: I don’t blame it. [pause] Why did the chickie cross the road?</p>\n<p>PAUL: You see what you’ve done to us, pal?</p>\n<p>RINGO: To get to the other side.</p>\n<p>JOHN: You’ve heard it before!</p>\n<p>RINGO: Yes.</p>\n<p>JOHN: Clichés…</p>\n<p>RINGO: What goes over water, under water, and never gets wet?</p>\n<p>JOHN: Hmm… a rubber mac.</p>\n<p>RINGO: No, an egg in a duck’s belly.</p>\n<p>PAUL: [cutting in] Now, alright, we can’t carry on like this indefinitely now, can we?</p>\n<p>RINGO: I beg you?</p>\n<p>PAUL: We can’t carry on like this indefinitely.</p>\n<p>JOHN: Doing this?</p>\n<p>RINGO: We seem to be.</p>\n<p>PAUL: We seem to, but we can’t. Because our hearts are—</p>\n<p>JOHN: Should we go play our group, then?</p>\n<p>PAUL: There’s the other point.</p>\n<p>JOHN: I think this is rather good.</p>\n<p>PAUL: It’s alright, I must say, but we can’t carry on like this indefinitely.</p>\n<p>JOHN: As some clips in between.</p>\n<p>PAUL: Yeah.</p>\n<p>JOHN: [pause] As I said, I’m just recovering from the day, you know…</p>\n<p>PAUL: Dyspepsia.</p>\n<p>YOKO: From the night, frankly.</p>\n<p>JOHN: [stage whisper] Oh, don’t say that, you’re be revealings!</p>\n<p>YOKO: [laughs] Oh… I didn’t think about that.</p>\n<p>JOHN: “From the night”, indeed. Next thing you’ll be telling them about our black sheets! [laughter] Enriched with Marylebone Station… [fidgeting; gets up] Right. [to Paul] Guitars? I thought that’s what they do.</p>\n<p>PAUL: That is what they do, but if you’re singing—</p>\n<p>JOHN: Oh, I’ll even sing you half a song I was writing.</p>\n<p>PAUL: [gets up; to Ringo] C’mon. Sounds. How’s – how’s about?</p>\n<p>RINGO: [subdued] Sound city… Yes, go on, I’ll come.</p>\n<p>PAUL: [concerned] How are you feeling?</p>\n<p>RINGO: No, I just feel a bit off. Very—</p>\n<p>PAUL: [joking; bleak] Last two years, actually.</p>\n<p>RINGO: [laughs] No, it’s not that. It’s just that some days— [inaudible; drowned out by voice marking slate] —you don’t know how you feel.</p>\n<h3 id=\"notes-7\">Notes</h3>\n<p>Kevin Harrington is one of the production runners. The phrase “canyons of your mind” references The Bonzo Dog Doo Dah Band. Doug Sulpy describes John and Paul’s exchange as “a duel of witticisms.” During this period John was using heroin, which is the most probable cause—directly or indirectly—for his vomiting. Paul’s repeated “we can’t carry on like this indefinitely” finally breaks through the absurdist fog, and they reluctantly agree to rehearse.</p>",{headings:4332,localImagePaths:4365,remoteImagePaths:4366,frontmatter:4367,imagePaths:4370},[4333,4334,4335,4336,4337,4338,4339,4340,4341,4342,4343,4344,4345,4346,4347,4348,4349,4350,4351,4352,4353,4354,4355,4356,4357,4358,4359,4360,4361,4362,4363,4364],{depth:89,slug:3605,text:3605},{depth:64,slug:1581,text:1582},{depth:64,slug:1799,text:3608},{depth:64,slug:3570,text:3571},{depth:89,slug:3611,text:3611},{depth:64,slug:3613,text:1582},{depth:64,slug:3615,text:3608},{depth:64,slug:3617,text:3571},{depth:89,slug:3619,text:3619},{depth:64,slug:3621,text:1582},{depth:64,slug:3623,text:3608},{depth:64,slug:3625,text:3571},{depth:89,slug:3664,text:3664},{depth:64,slug:3666,text:1582},{depth:64,slug:3668,text:3608},{depth:64,slug:3670,text:3571},{depth:89,slug:3672,text:3672},{depth:64,slug:3674,text:1582},{depth:64,slug:3676,text:3608},{depth:64,slug:3678,text:3571},{depth:89,slug:3843,text:3843},{depth:64,slug:3845,text:1582},{depth:64,slug:3847,text:3608},{depth:64,slug:3849,text:3571},{depth:89,slug:3851,text:3851},{depth:64,slug:3853,text:1582},{depth:64,slug:3855,text:3608},{depth:64,slug:3857,text:3571},{depth:89,slug:4021,text:4021},{depth:64,slug:4023,text:1582},{depth:64,slug:4025,text:3608},{depth:64,slug:4027,text:3571},[],[],{title:4320,category:1789,date_range:4321,source:1791,reliability:1792,relevance:1793,tags:4368,created:4369},[1431,1795,1796,1797,1798,1799,4323,3586,3587,3588,3592,3590,4042,3722,4324],["Date","2025-12-19T00:00:00.000Z"],[],"get-back-dialogue-day-to-day/day-8-get-back.md","get-back-dialogue-day-to-day/day-9-get-back",{id:4372,data:4374,body:4380,filePath:4381,digest:4382,rendered:4383,legacyId:4412},{title:4375,category:1789,date_range:4376,source:1791,reliability:1792,relevance:1793,tags:4377,created:4379},"Get Back / Let It Be Sessions: Day 9 transcripts and notes","January 21, 1969",[1431,1795,1796,1797,1798,1799,4378,3586,3587],"1/21/1969",["Date","2025-12-19T00:00:00.000Z"],"# 21 January 1969\r\n\r\n## 1\r\n\r\n### Overview\r\n\r\nJanuary 21st, 1969 (Apple Studios, London): A singing of the 1957 song 'In The Middle Of An Island' segues naturally into 'Gilly, Gilly, Ossenfeffer, Katzenellen Bogen by the Sea'.\r\n\r\n### Dialogue\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### Notes\r\n\r\nBrief musical reference only; no verbatim dialogue recorded.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 2\r\n\r\n### Overview\r\n\r\nJanuary 21st, 1969 (Apple Studios, London): Paul leads the band into a lively rendition of Ronnie Hawkins' 'Forty Days' (itself a variant of Chuck Berry's 'Thirty Days').

The Beatles returned to Twickenham the following day (January 3).\r\n\r\n### Project Concept\r\n\r\n**Original plan:**\r\n- Rehearsals for television special featuring new songs performed live in front of audience\r\n- Cameras capturing both preparation and final show\r\n- Hour of Beatles numbers, one after another, no guest stars\r\n- Minimal filming outside concert performance venue\r\n- Scheduled live show: January 18 or thereabouts (2-3 \"audience shows\")\r\n- Simultaneous filming of rehearsal work for \"Beatles At Work\" documentary (separate from TV special, to be shown later, perhaps 10 years later)\r\n\r\n**Venue considerations (still undecided):**\r\n- Roundhouse in north London\r\n- Old Roman theater in Sabratha, Libya (Tripoli)\r\n- Old flour mill on Thames\r\n- Dozen other alternatives in London and provinces\r\n- Twickenham Film Studios: temporary rehearsal space/home base while searching\r\n\r\n**Key personnel:**\r\n- Director: Michael Lindsay-Hogg\r\n- Producer: Denis O'Dell (Apple Films)\r\n- Engineer/Producer: Glyn Johns\r\n- Producer (non-producing capacity): George Martin\r\n- Roadies: Mal Evans, Kevin Harrington\r\n\r\n**Frequent visitors:**\r\n- Yoko Ono\r\n- Shyamasundar Das (friend of George)\r\n\r\n### Session Timeline\r\n\r\n**9:30 AM:** Mal Evans and Kevin Harrington prepare stage and equipment (Michael Lindsay-Hogg filming setup)\r\n\r\n**11:00 AM:** John (with Yoko Ono) and George arrive first\r\n- Light jamming while waiting for others\r\n- Songs touched: \"Don't Let Me Down,\" \"Dig A Pony,\" \"I've Got A Feeling,\" \"Sun King,\" \"Let It Down,\" \"All Things Must Pass\"\r\n\r\n**Shortly after 11:00 AM:** Ringo arrives\r\n- Brief work on \"Don't Let Me Down\"\r\n\r\n**12:30 PM:** Paul arrives (delayed by public transport)\r\n- Came by underground, local train, then taxi from Hampton Court station\r\n- Had meant to do entire journey by public transport but caught cab knowing he was late\r\n\r\n**Note:** Mal Evans telephoned all four Beatles at 8:30 AM to remind them of 11:00 AM call time\r\n\r\n### Main Songs Rehearsed\r\n\r\n#### Don't Let Me Down (John)\r\n- **First track rehearsed this day**\r\n- 15 versions total\r\n- **Early work:** John and George alone, then Ringo joined while waiting for Paul\r\n- **George's reaction:** \"That's a good one…I like simple tunes\"\r\n- **John's assessment:** \"That's the most finished\"\r\n\r\n**Paul's re-arrangements after arrival:**\r\n- Begin with title sung twice\r\n- \"Skip that little interlude\" (the \"I'm in love for the first time / please don't let me down\" chorus conclusion)\r\n- Said it \"sounded like a middle eight so scrap that and use it somewhere near the end\"\r\n\r\n**John's experimental lyric:** Five repeats of phrase beginning \"everybody got a...\" (exercise of already developed idea with Paul for \"I've Got A Feeling\")\r\n\r\n**Early lyric version:** Choruses concluded with \"I'm in love for the first time / please don't let me down\"\r\n\r\n**Next session:** January 3\r\n\r\n**Snippet included:** Beginning of \"Fly On The Wall\" disc (Let It Be...Naked, 2003)\r\n\r\n#### I've Got A Feeling (Paul + John composite)\r\n- 20 run-throughs\r\n- **Most accomplished new song by day's end** (though still needed refining)\r\n- **Structure:** Paul's composition blended with John's \"Everybody Had A Hard Year\"\r\n- **Status:** Final structure already refined by this stage\r\n\r\n**Paul's direction:**\r\n- Called out chords for John and George\r\n- Stopped performance to explain arrangement\r\n- Switched from bass to acoustic guitar to demonstrate ideas\r\n- Spent considerable time showing John descending guitar riff\r\n\r\n**Vocal arrangements:**\r\n- Vocal and harmony parts already in place\r\n- Simultaneous lead vocals near conclusion already established\r\n\r\n**John's humor:** Incorporated different lines like \"everybody got a hard on\"\r\n- **Paul's counter:** \"Everybody Had A Hard On Except For Me And My Monkey\" (when George asked title)\r\n- **John's title joke:** \"I've Got A Hard On\" (actual title: \"I've Got A Feeling\")\r\n\r\n**Ringo's drumming:** Swing-style rhythm during ascending/descending triplet chords in instrumental sections\r\n\r\n**Next session:** January 3\r\n\r\n#### Two Of Us (Paul)\r\n- 9 rehearsals\r\n- **Working title:** \"On My Way Home\"\r\n- **Lyrics:** All written at this time\r\n- Frequent pauses for Paul to guide through chord progressions and time-signature changes\r\n\r\n**Paul's instruction:**\r\n- \"It sort of, like, goes into a waltz, but you'll get the idea\" (regarding \"on our way home\" segments)\r\n- Good amount of instruction needed for time-signature changes\r\n- John and George following on electric guitars, Ringo cautiously on drums\r\n\r\n**Vocal arrangements explored:**\r\n- Paul sang lead throughout initially\r\n- George adding harmonies and slight lead guitar lines\r\n- John eventually joined on vocals\r\n- Paul suggested John sing lead with Paul harmonizing throughout\r\n- Three-part harmonies suggested in places (later dropped)\r\n\r\n**Discarded idea:** \"Lightning middle-eight\" \r\n- Second bridge occurrence running through \"you and I have memories...\" lyrics twice as fast\r\n- Paul asked others' opinion, eventually omitted\r\n\r\n**Paul's humorous demo:** Repeatedly sang \"Two of us, Henry Cooper\" (British heavyweight boxer) to demonstrate vocal line emphasis\r\n\r\n**Progression:** Paul switched to bass toward end as chord changes became ingrained\r\n\r\n**Next sessions:** Played once on January 3, worked extensively on January 6\r\n\r\n#### Dig A Pony (John)\r\n- **Title at this point:** \"All I Want Is You\"\r\n- Solo demo by John to George before Paul and Ringo arrived\r\n- John performed solo rendition on electric guitar\r\n- Practically made it through to end with much of lyrics already in place\r\n- **George's clarification:** \"dig a pony?\" / John: \"yeah, dig A pony\"\r\n\r\n**Early lyric variation:** \"I kill a hound dog\" at beginning of one verse (held over to later rehearsals)\r\n\r\n**George's contribution:** Some lead guitar contributions prompting John's \"that's right\"\r\n\r\n**Status:** Most lyrics already finalized\r\n\r\n**Next session:** January 7\r\n\r\n#### Sun King (John)\r\n- 5 run-throughs\r\n- First introduction in studio\r\n\r\n**Next sessions:** \r\n- 4 more takes on January 3\r\n- One quick version on January 10\r\n- Revisited July 1969 for Abbey Road album\r\n\r\n### Atmosphere & Concerns\r\n\r\n**George's complaint:** Acoustics of film studio terrible\r\n\r\n**Paul's defense of Twickenham:**\r\n- Referenced \"Hey Jude\" and \"Revolution\" promotional films shot there few months before\r\n- Cited \"Yer Blues\" recorded in \"little room like a bog\" with great results despite poor acoustics\r\n- \"This place sounds terrible now, but it may just be great, you never know\"\r\n\r\n**Overall mood:** \r\n- Uncertainty about venue and dates\r\n- John and George lukewarm about rehearsing in vast, cavernous soundstage\r\n- Conversations about outdoor performance or smaller venue without firm conclusions\r\n- General aim: recapture spontaneity of playing live\r\n\r\n**Day's focus:** Three main new songs emerged as central to project\r\n- \"Don't Let Me Down\"\r\n- \"I've Got A Feeling\"\r\n- \"Two Of Us\"\r\n\r\n### Chronological Conversations\r\n\r\n#### Conversation 1: Venue & Acoustics Discussion\r\n\r\n**Context:** Discussion about rehearsal space quality at Twickenham and considerations for final performance venue.\r\n\r\n**George Martin:** \"All you need is, really, a good acoustic place to be in\"\r\n\r\n**George Martin:** \"I like the idea of working with a big PA though, because it will trigger off something. It'd be like doing a live performance\"\r\n\r\n**Paul McCartney:** \"Which this isn't... Nobody is, sort of, definitely struck on this place. George was saying before, it's not good acoustically\"\r\n\r\n**Paul McCartney:** \"We did 'Yer Blues' in there\" [referencing small room success]\r\n\r\n**Paul McCartney:** \"We'll be alright, it's just... Just play it, we'll just play it. We'll move out of here in a couple of days. Or maybe we won't...\"\r\n\r\n**Michael Lindsay-Hogg:** \"My real feeling is that the venue itself ought to be quite good, as opposed to shabby\"\r\n\r\n**Dennis O'Dell:** [offers small soundproof stage available to look at - filming \"The Magic Christian\" starring Peter Sellers and Ringo; has Twickenham under contract till end of May]\r\n\r\n**Michael Lindsay-Hogg:** \"I just feel if we could get a spectacular venue, we'd gain rather than lose\"\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n#### Conversation 2: Live Performance Location Debate - Open Air & Libya Proposal\r\n\r\n**Context:** Extended discussion about potential venues including outdoor performance and exotic locations.\r\n\r\n**Paul McCartney:** \"The thing I don't want is like, a TV show sound. They always seem to have that sort of farty, little sound on TV shows\"\r\n\r\n**Glyn Johns:** \"Well, don't forget you're hearing it on a TV speaker, which is a grotty speaker\"\r\n\r\n**Glyn Johns:** \"The thing is that an open-air sound is fantastic. I've always wanted to do something in the open air\"\r\n\r\n**Paul McCartney:** \"It'd be nice to try and find some way to do it out of doors\"\r\n\r\n**Glyn Johns:** \"It's so bloody cold\"\r\n\r\n**Michael Lindsay-Hogg:** \"It's your English rain which is worrying about outdoors in this country\"\r\n\r\n**Paul McCartney:** \"Snow or rain will do me. You know, wind and anything. Make all that, it's just a frozen hand trying to play those notes\"\r\n\r\n**Paul McCartney:** \"I wouldn't mind playing in the rain...\"\r\n\r\n**Paul McCartney:** \"It's all right. You might just have a few deaths on the set due to electric shocks\"\r\n\r\n**Glyn Johns:** [laughing] \"Yes, you could\"\r\n\r\n**Michael Lindsay-Hogg:** \"I was very taken by the place Denis talked about, the amphitheatre [in Sabratha, Libya]. Because the whole thing... I could see torch-lit, two thousand Arabs, and friends around. And I thought the venue was appropriate\"\r\n\r\n**Paul McCartney:** \"I think you'll find we are not going abroad, 'cos Ringo just said he doesn't want to go abroad and he put his foot down\"\r\n\r\n**Michael Lindsay-Hogg:** \"I think the thing to do is just see what we all feel in a day or two as opposed to making anything hard and fast immediately. 'Cos we may find the idea – or any idea – grows and gets more attractive or less attractive given where you are now\"\r\n\r\n### Source Quotes\r\n\r\n**Mal Evans (Beatles Monthly Book, March 1969):**\r\n- Original project concept was different from final outcome\r\n- Expansion of \"Hey Jude\" film clip format success\r\n- TV special: hour of Beatles numbers, no guest stars\r\n- January 18 agreed upon for 2-3 audience shows\r\n- Documentary filming idea: show what happens when Beatles build new set of songs\r\n- Venue search: Roundhouse, flour mill on Thames, dozen alternatives\r\n- Libya theatre blown out too\r\n\r\n**Glyn Johns (Sound Man, 2014):**\r\n- December 1968: Paul called (Johns thought it was Mick Jagger joking)\r\n- Paul's pitch: Write new material, record live in front of audience for TV show and album\r\n- Venue: somewhere exotic (to be discussed)\r\n- Meeting set: Twickenham Film Studios soundstage, January 2, 1969\r\n- Johns' reaction: \"I felt like I'd won the lottery\"","src/content/research/get-back-dialogue-day-to-day/mccartney-website/day-1-overview.md","df8d2da79ef86312",{html:4430,metadata:4431},"<h2 id=\"day-1-overview-january-2-1969\">Day 1 Overview (January 2, 1969)</h2>\n<p>First day of “Get Back” sessions at Twickenham Film Studios.

We started reminiscing and playing old rock'n'roll songs. They said: 'Sit in. You want to stay and help us finish the album? Take a solo…' They just made me a member of the band\"\r\n\r\n\"I was on tour with Ray Charles and we were in London. George was at the concert and thought: 'Hey, that looks like Billy Preston.' So he called around and found out that it was me. He called me at the hotel and invited me over to see the guys. Before I got there, Mal Evans had told me that they had been going through a lot of depression, and that he was glad that I came around because it gave them a lot of life. It made them happy a little bit\"\r\n\r\n**George Harrison (Beatles Anthology 2000):**\r\n\"Billy came down and I said, 'Remember Billy? Here he is – he can play the piano'. He got on the electric piano, and straight away there was 100% improvement in the vibe in the room. Having this fifth person was just enough to cut the ice that we'd created among ourselves. Billy didn't know all the politics and the games that had been going on, so in his innocence he got stuck in and gave an extra little kick to the band. Everybody was happier to have somebody else playing and it made what we were doing more enjoyable. We all played better and that was a great session. It was more or less just as it is on the record\"\r\n\r\n**George Harrison (Keith Badman 'Off the Record' 2008):**\r\n\"It was still very strained, the atmosphere, and then Billy Preston walked into the office. I just grabbed him and brought him down to the studio, and said, 'How would you like to play piano?' And it put everything more at ease, because, having a fifth person there, it sort of off-set the vibes\"\r\n\r\n**George Harrison (Recording the Beatles 2006):**\r\n\"I pulled in Billy Preston. It helped because the others would have to control themselves a bit more. John and Paul mainly, because they had to, you know, act more handsomely. It's interesting to see how people behave nicely when you bring a guest in because they don't want everyone to know that they're so bitchy\"\r\n\r\n**George Harrison (Classic Rock May 2020):**\r\n\"It's interesting to see how people behave nicely when you bring a guest in, because they don't really want everybody to know they're so bitchy… Suddenly everybody's on their best behaviour\"\r\n\r\n**Ken Mansfield (US manager at Apple Records):**\r\n\"Billy was really special to the band at that time. I think George was very wise for bringing him in, because Billy was a calming effect. They were all really big fans of Billy. He was really important to the whole thing. When they were in the studio, they would play something and Billy would look over at me with his eyes just as big as saucers and go: 'Wow, did you hear that?' And they'd turn to Billy and say: 'Hey, why don't you do this here?' and Billy would go: 'Wow, that's great'\"\r\n\r\n**Paul McCartney (Beatles Anthology 2000):**\r\n\"Billy was brilliant – a little young whizz-kid. We'd always got on very well with him. He showed up in London and we all said, 'Oh Bill! Great – let's have him play on a few things.' So he started sitting in on the sessions, because he was an old mate really.\r\n\r\nIt might have helped us all behave better with one another on the sessions. I think it also created problems, because as The Beatles we'd always just been four people in the band. We were very much a unit — the Four-Headed Monster, I've heard us referred to.\r\n\r\nSo when Billy came in, I think that though we did have to behave ourselves a bit – because it was like having a guest in the house, someone you put your best manners on for – there was a slight worry in the background also that maybe he was joining the group. That kind of thing was happening. So we couldn't tell whether it was a crack in the whole thing, or whether it was going to be good. It was a little bit puzzling.\r\n\r\nBut he played great and we all had a great time, so it worked out fine in the end\"\r\n\r\n### Main Songs Recorded\r\n\r\n#### Don't Let Me Down (John)\r\n\r\n**This session:** 18 rehearsals with Billy Preston joining\r\n\r\n**Billy Preston's arrival:** Fulfilled John's desire to have keyboardist on song\r\n\r\n**Mood:** Lifted dramatically\r\n\r\n**John's instruction to Ringo:** Crash cymbal just before he begins singing to \"give me the courage to come screaming in\"\r\n\r\n**Glyn Johns selection:**\r\n- One version chosen for inclusion on first \"Get Back\" album incarnation (delayed and shelved)\r\n- Featured in many early bootlegs\r\n- Take selected for 2021 \"Let It Be\" 50th anniversary reissue\r\n\r\n**Notable elements in version:**\r\n- John ad-libbing \"she done me good…goody, goody, goody good\"\r\n- John's encouragement: \"Hit it, Bill\" before electric piano solo begins\r\n- \"Oh, yeah!

Release scheduled month after this session.\r\n\r\n**Paul McCartney:** \"Neil thinks they'll want to print their own in America. It's like… I don't like that thing where it goes cheap when it goes to America – and they do the reprint. Because the album's gonna be called Postcard. By Mary Hopkin. So we're just getting Valentine's, the people who make postcards, to put one of them on the cover of the LP. There's no, sort of, sleeve notes… And just a few pictures of her in it all\"\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n#### Conversation 2: Billy Preston Joins - Introduction\r\n\r\n**Context:** Billy joined session after lunch, promptly persuaded by John to join band for project. George proposed playing numbers they had so far for Billy to learn.\r\n\r\n**John Lennon:** \"Every number's got a piano part. And normally we overdub it. But this time we wanna do it live\"\r\n\r\n**Billy Preston:** \"Yeah. That'd be nice\"\r\n\r\n**John Lennon:** \"I mean, just live to ourselves… Straight off, one number after the other. And that means having somebody in on it\"\r\n\r\n**George Harrison:** \"If you'd like to do that you're welcome\"\r\n\r\n**Billy Preston:** \"Sure. Beautiful\"\r\n\r\n**John Lennon:** \"Right. And then you'd be on the album\"\r\n\r\n**Billy Preston:** \"You're kidding\"\r\n\r\n**John Lennon:** \"Well, that's good then. We've taped a few. The thing is to get some tapes made of what we've done, and let him have a listen, take 'em home at night\"\r\n\r\n**George Harrison:** \"He'll probably pick them up much quicker hearing us play 'em\"\r\n\r\n**Paul McCartney:** \"Yeah, just rehearsing them\"\r\n\r\n**John Lennon:** \"Have you met Billy, George?\"\r\n\r\n**George Martin:** \"How do you do, Billy?\"\r\n\r\n**John Lennon:** \"That's George Martin, our A&R man. That's Billy. We played with him in Hamburg. He was backing Little Richard\"\r\n\r\n**Paul McCartney:** \"In the old days\"\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n#### Conversation 3: Film Concept Evolution - Third Beatles Movie\r\n\r\n**Context:** Goal of sessions evolved. Idea of making commercial film from sessions emerged - would become 3rd Beatles movie. Film would culminate in live event. Primrose Hill (grassy hill with spectacular views across London) considered.\r\n\r\n**Michael Lindsay-Hogg:** \"I had a word with Neil. What he indicates is that we'll do something early next week\"\r\n\r\n**John Lennon:** \"And it'll be great. Soon as we got them off… We almost know three numbers, actually. I mean, we'll get it. And the thing is we've got Billy now\"\r\n\r\n**Michael Lindsay-Hogg:** \"Is he going to stay with you?\"\r\n\r\n**John Lennon:** \"Yeah, well sure. He's the guy. And that solves a lot. Paul was saying we do the whole show once here, and then maybe go up Primrose Hill, or something\"\r\n\r\n**Michael Lindsay-Hogg:** \"I think do it here and then, like, take a week…\"\r\n\r\n**John Lennon:** \"Or we could do half of the LP here and the other half outside. It will be fantastic with this whole build up with bits of paper, and Twickenham, and all that scene. And it will be a movie, you know, not a TV show. It will be the third Beatles movie\"\r\n\r\n**Michael Lindsay-Hogg:** \"If it's good enough, yeah\"\r\n\r\n**John Lennon:** \"It's good enough now\"\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n#### Conversation 4: Primrose Hill Planning\r\n\r\n**Michael Lindsay-Hogg:** \"Paul, what I'd like to do now is go and talk to Neil about seeing if Primrose Hill is free. Can I do that?\"\r\n\r\n**Paul McCartney:** \"It would be nice almost not to tell 'em\"\r\n\r\n**Michael Lindsay-Hogg:** \"Exactly. That's why I wanted to do it in Africa. Because you just start playing, and one by one they come, one by one, ten by ten…\"\r\n\r\n**Unknown:** \"Well, to me that's okay. Primrose Hill. And I dig it\"\r\n\r\n**Paul McCartney:** \"And then if it lasts for two days, that will be really good because we'll all be forced into a time thing and we won't have another go at it\"\r\n\r\n**Michael Lindsay-Hogg:** \"Right, I agree. I think the second day, in fact, will be the one that will make it\"\r\n\r\n**Paul McCartney:** \"And I bet that would just, sort of, magically then give us the show\"\r\n\r\n**Michael Lindsay-Hogg:** \"So, but just roughly, timewise, you'd say in about a week?\"\r\n\r\n**Paul McCartney:** \"Yeah\"\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n#### Conversation 5: Allen Klein Meeting Scheduled\r\n\r\n**Context:** Peter Brown (managing director of Apple Corps) approached John to arrange meeting with controversial American businessman Allen Klein. John requested meeting be scheduled for Monday the 27th.\r\n\r\n**Peter Brown:** \"I've spoken with Mr. Klein. He's coming in Friday. So I don't think he'll be here until the end of the day. So, about six o'clock on Friday\"\r\n\r\n**John Lennon:** \"I think… Weren't we doing something on Friday night?\"\r\n\r\n**Yoko Ono:** \"Friday night, yes\"\r\n\r\n**John Lennon:** \"He's not coming for a day, is he? Can I see him on Monday night?\"\r\n\r\n**Peter Brown:** \"Yeah ok\"\r\n\r\n**John Lennon:** \"Tell him we'll go for dinner\"\r\n\r\n**Yoko Ono:** \"Who's this?\"\r\n\r\n**John Lennon:** \"Allen Klein\"","src/content/research/get-back-dialogue-day-to-day/mccartney-website/day-13-overview.md","95092d2501df45f9",{html:4544,metadata:4545},"<h2 id=\"day-13-overview-january-22-1969\">Day 13 Overview (January 22, 1969)</h2>\n<p>Thirteenth day of “Get Back” sessions - <strong>second day at Apple Studios, pivotal due to Billy Preston’s arrival.</strong> Beatles returned to Apple Studio the following day (January 23).</p>\n<h3 id=\"overall-atmosphere\">Overall Atmosphere</h3>\n<p><strong>Pivotal day:</strong> Billy Preston’s arrival after lunch profoundly influenced tone of remaining sessions</p>\n<p><strong>Billy Preston background:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>First met Beatles in Hamburg in early 1960s</li>\n<li>In London for concert and TV appearances with Ray Charles</li>\n<li>George Harrison encountered him and invited him to Beatles sessions</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Preston’s impact:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Joined after lunch, contributing electric piano and keyboards</li>\n<li>Playing immediately enhanced sound of sessions</li>\n<li>Project adhered to strict “no overdubs” rule (Preston’s presence fulfilled this need)</li>\n<li>Had energizing effect on group, encouraging renewed focus and enthusiasm</li>\n<li>Earlier tensions of Twickenham sessions seemed distant memory</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Day’s focus:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Concentrated efforts on three songs: “Don’t Let Me Down,” “I’ve Got A Feeling,” “Dig A Pony”</li>\n<li>Repeated rehearsals, recordings, and playbacks formed core of day’s work</li>\n<li>Preston quickly adapted to material, inspiring band to push themselves creatively</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Cover songs:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Dabbled far less than previous sessions, showing greater focus on recording new songs</li>\n<li>Attempts included Fats Domino’s “I’m Ready” (also known as “Rocker”) and “Save The Last Dance For Me”</li>\n<li>Both included by Glyn Johns in multiple iterations of his “Get Back” album</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Project evolution:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Improved working environment at Apple Studio combined with Preston’s contributions reinvigorated Beatles</li>\n<li>Live performance idea remained alive</li>\n<li>Discussions of potential venues such as London’s Primrose Hill</li>\n<li>Band rediscovering creative synergy, leaving discord of earlier sessions behind</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"billy-preston-firsthand-accounts\">Billy Preston Firsthand Accounts</h3>\n<p><strong>Billy Preston:</strong>\r\n“When I got there, they were filming Let It Be and recording and all. We started reminiscing and playing old rock’n’roll songs. They said: ‘Sit in. You want to stay and help us finish the album? Take a solo…’ They just made me a member of the band”</p>\n<p>“I was on tour with Ray Charles and we were in London. George was at the concert and thought: ‘Hey, that looks like Billy Preston.’ So he called around and found out that it was me. He called me at the hotel and invited me over to see the guys. Before I got there, Mal Evans had told me that they had been going through a lot of depression, and that he was glad that I came around because it gave them a lot of life. It made them happy a little bit”</p>\n<p><strong>George Harrison (Beatles Anthology 2000):</strong>\r\n“Billy came down and I said, ‘Remember Billy? Here he is – he can play the piano’. He got on the electric piano, and straight away there was 100% improvement in the vibe in the room. Having this fifth person was just enough to cut the ice that we’d created among ourselves. Billy didn’t know all the politics and the games that had been going on, so in his innocence he got stuck in and gave an extra little kick to the band. Everybody was happier to have somebody else playing and it made what we were doing more enjoyable. We all played better and that was a great session. It was more or less just as it is on the record”</p>\n<p><strong>George Harrison (Keith Badman ‘Off the Record’ 2008):</strong>\r\n“It was still very strained, the atmosphere, and then Billy Preston walked into the office. I just grabbed him and brought him down to the studio, and said, ‘How would you like to play piano?’ And it put everything more at ease, because, having a fifth person there, it sort of off-set the vibes”</p>\n<p><strong>George Harrison (Recording the Beatles 2006):</strong>\r\n“I pulled in Billy Preston. It helped because the others would have to control themselves a bit more. John and Paul mainly, because they had to, you know, act more handsomely. It’s interesting to see how people behave nicely when you bring a guest in because they don’t want everyone to know that they’re so bitchy”</p>\n<p><strong>George Harrison (Classic Rock May 2020):</strong>\r\n“It’s interesting to see how people behave nicely when you bring a guest in, because they don’t really want everybody to know they’re so bitchy… Suddenly everybody’s on their best behaviour”</p>\n<p><strong>Ken Mansfield (US manager at Apple Records):</strong>\r\n“Billy was really special to the band at that time. I think George was very wise for bringing him in, because Billy was a calming effect. They were all really big fans of Billy. He was really important to the whole thing. When they were in the studio, they would play something and Billy would look over at me with his eyes just as big as saucers and go: ‘Wow, did you hear that?’ And they’d turn to Billy and say: ‘Hey, why don’t you do this here?’ and Billy would go: ‘Wow, that’s great’”</p>\n<p><strong>Paul McCartney (Beatles Anthology 2000):</strong>\r\n“Billy was brilliant – a little young whizz-kid. We’d always got on very well with him. He showed up in London and we all said, ‘Oh Bill! Great – let’s have him play on a few things.’ So he started sitting in on the sessions, because he was an old mate really.</p>\n<p>It might have helped us all behave better with one another on the sessions. I think it also created problems, because as The Beatles we’d always just been four people in the band. We were very much a unit — the Four-Headed Monster, I’ve heard us referred to.</p>\n<p>So when Billy came in, I think that though we did have to behave ourselves a bit – because it was like having a guest in the house, someone you put your best manners on for – there was a slight worry in the background also that maybe he was joining the group. That kind of thing was happening. So we couldn’t tell whether it was a crack in the whole thing, or whether it was going to be good. It was a little bit puzzling.</p>\n<p>But he played great and we all had a great time, so it worked out fine in the end”</p>\n<h3 id=\"main-songs-recorded\">Main Songs Recorded</h3>\n<h4 id=\"dont-let-me-down-john\">Don’t Let Me Down (John)</h4>\n<p><strong>This session:</strong> 18 rehearsals with Billy Preston joining</p>\n<p><strong>Billy Preston’s arrival:</strong> Fulfilled John’s desire to have keyboardist on song</p>\n<p><strong>Mood:</strong> Lifted dramatically</p>\n<p><strong>John’s instruction to Ringo:</strong> Crash cymbal just before he begins singing to “give me the courage to come screaming in”</p>\n<p><strong>Glyn Johns selection:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>One version chosen for inclusion on first “Get Back” album incarnation (delayed and shelved)</li>\n<li>Featured in many early bootlegs</li>\n<li>Take selected for 2021 “Let It Be” 50th anniversary reissue</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Notable elements in version:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>John ad-libbing “she done me good…goody, goody, goody good”</li>\n<li>John’s encouragement: “Hit it, Bill” before electric piano solo begins</li>\n<li>“Oh, yeah!

'Oh, why don't we do that?,' or 'How 'bout this on the drums?' or Ringo, like on something like 'Get Back.' We were just kicking it around. There's a little jam and then he gets on the drums, 'bum, buppa, bum, buppa, bum…' He's got this little kind of almost military thing going. Well, that really was, 'Aah, great, different!'

He's waiting for you,' and it's an old drag queen back on the ranch in Tucson, 'wearing his hi-heel shoes!'\"\r\n\r\n**George's Motown reference:**\r\n- Notes song's similarity to classic Motown hit by The Four Tops\r\n- \"It's like 'Reach Out.' Remember in 'Reach Out' where everything stops and then…'I'll be back! (sic)' That's what the song needs, it needs a catchy riff\"\r\n\r\n**Arrangement decisions:**\r\n- Paul decides to include subdued chorus after first solo\r\n- Introduce next solo section with descending keyboard riff by Billy Preston during break George suggested\r\n- After second guitar solo from John decided upon, decide to try standing up to rehearse newly arranged song\r\n- Results in humorous medley of \"Help!\" and \"Please Please Me\" that sends everyone into laughing fit\r\n\r\n**Final arrangement status:** Although final \"Beatles break\" and coda yet to materialize, final arrangement as we know it getting close\r\n\r\n**Recording statistics:**\r\n- 43 rehearsals performed this day\r\n- At least 10 attempted as official recordings with Glyn Johns and George Martin in control room\r\n\r\n**\"Sht\" take one:**\r\n- George Martin called out before first official take: \"What are you calling this\"\r\n- Paul answered: \"Sht\"\r\n- John added: \"Sht Back!\"\r\n- George Martin designated: \"'Sh*t' take one\" before tapes started rolling\r\n\r\n**Alan Parsons debut:**\r\n- Young Alan Parsons made debut as tape operator this day\r\n- Long-standing career as engineer, producer and musician beginning by witnessing Beatles formalize \"Get Back\" before his eyes\r\n\r\n**Single discussion:**\r\n- While listening back to recordings in control room, George asked others what their last single was and how long ago it released\r\n- Paul answered: \"Hey Jude\" roughly five months ago\r\n- **George suggested:** \"It'd be nice to do takes until we get it and just have it (out) before the show…Just put it out as a single next week\"\r\n- John showed on board: \"Let's finish it off for a single tomorrow, and we'll do 'Part Two' on the back side!\"\r\n- With this decided (nixing John's idea to put \"Get Back (Part Two)\" on b-side), had definite goal for next session\r\n\r\n**Actual release:** \"Get Back\" released as next Beatles single April 1969\r\n\r\n#### Oh!

Film's climax would feature live performance. Previous day, Primrose Hill considered as potential location. This day, discussions focused on timing - consensus emerged that performance should take place within week to ten days. Also acknowledged weekend work might be required to meet timeline.\r\n\r\n**Michael Lindsay-Hogg:** \"Well, the current thought is that we'll try to do it at the end of next week, maybe\"\r\n\r\n**Ringo Starr:** \"You know, if we did ten days straight from now…\"\r\n\r\n**George Martin:** \"Well, you're working so well together now.

Ultimately, \"Get Back\" released as next Beatles single April 1969.\r\n\r\n**George Harrison:** \"It'd be nice to just put it out as a single. Just do a single of it now\"\r\n\r\n**John Lennon:** \"Let's knock it off for a single maybe\"\r\n\r\n**Paul McCartney:** \"Let's finish it off…\"\r\n\r\n**George Harrison:** \"Just make it now and have it as a single, put it out next week\"\r\n\r\n**Paul McCartney:** \"Oh, yeah?\"\r\n\r\n**George Harrison:** \"It's easy.

Remember how we used to have it? One record would be coming out, and we'd put another one out. Like in the old hustling days\"\r\n\r\n**Paul McCartney:** \"Yeah\"\r\n\r\n**George Harrison:** \"It'd be great.

When \"Let It Be\" released in 1970, concept came to fruition as special limited edition that included 164-page book featuring collection of images and dialogue from sessions.\r\n\r\n**John Lennon:** \"Did you hear about the book idea?\"\r\n\r\n**Paul McCartney:** \"Yeah\"\r\n\r\n**John Lennon:** \"They're great, man. Really great. It'll be a book of the film. They can have it out almost simultaneously. The book of the film, the book of the… All that. The package is great\"\r\n\r\n**Paul McCartney:** \"It's good\"\r\n\r\n**John Lennon:** \"They'll have slides, you know. And I'll talk to John Kosh on Monday. 'Cause I think he'd be a nice guy to design it\"\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n#### Conversation 2: Billy Preston Contract & \"Fifth Beatle\" Discussion\r\n\r\n**Context:** Topic of discussion was Billy Preston's contract for participation in recordings. John even suggested inviting Billy to join band permanently, effectively becoming \"fifth Beatle.\" However, Paul not enthusiastic about idea, responding half-jokingly: \"It's just bad enough with four.\"\r\n\r\n**John Lennon:** \"Did you tell Paul we've got Billy a contract?\"\r\n\r\n**George Harrison:** \"No, not yet\"\r\n\r\n**John Lennon:** \"We've got him off Capitol. Just like that. And George will produce him\"\r\n\r\n**Paul McCartney:** \"I was just talking to him about that. I said, 'What did you do after Hamburg and that?' He said, 'Well, I saw you guys go, sort of, 'voomph' to the moon'. And he sort of had a couple groups together. But he's never, sort of, done his thing\"\r\n\r\n**George Harrison:** \"The main thing, Billy just really is so knocked out, so thrilled doing it. And also he sees it's his great opportunity\"\r\n\r\n**Paul McCartney:** \"Then he puts his name and The Beatles. Like, it's Billy Preston!\"\r\n\r\n**George Harrison:** \"I didn't think about it. We'll have to decide about paying him. 'Cause, if we were having Nicky Hopkins playing, we'd have to pay him session musician rates. Which will be…\"\r\n\r\n**John Lennon:** \"This is, like, to be in the film and that\"\r\n\r\n**Paul McCartney:** \"Yeah, we'll just say to Ron, 'Look, will you talk to Billy?'\"\r\n\r\n**John Lennon:** \"On the film it happened so great. I mean, I'd just like him in our band, actually. I'd like a fifth Beatle. At Twickenham, suddenly, there was three, now there's four of us, then there's five!\"\r\n\r\n**George Harrison:** \"We can do that, as well. If I asked Dylan to join The Beatles, and he would, as well, you know, and we get 'em all in here!\"\r\n\r\n**Paul McCartney:** \"Yeah, but they don't need to join The Beatles\"\r\n\r\n**John Lennon:** \"We'd call it The Beatles & Co. That'll be our band\"\r\n\r\n**George Harrison:** \"I mean, it's Sergeant Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, innit?\"\r\n\r\n**John Lennon:** \"We could get 'em all\"\r\n\r\n**Paul McCartney:** \"I just don't, because it's just bad enough with four\"","src/content/research/get-back-dialogue-day-to-day/mccartney-website/day-15-overview.md","e5b9dece40e8a717",{html:4749,metadata:4750},"<h2 id=\"day-15-overview-january-24-1969\">Day 15 Overview (January 24, 1969)</h2>\n<p>Fifteenth day of “Get Back” sessions - <strong>fourth day at Apple Studios, varied day with recording debuts.</strong> Beatles continued rehearsing over weekend, returned to Apple Studio following day (Saturday, January 25), which began with Glyn Johns playing back results of his overnight mixes.</p>\n<h3 id=\"overall-atmosphere\">Overall Atmosphere</h3>\n<p><strong>Billy Preston’s absence:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Rehearsed TV show appearance</li>\n<li>Absence shifted band’s focus away from refining “Get Back”</li>\n<li>Arrived late afternoon</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Day’s focus:</strong> Concentrated on “Two of Us”</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Initially attempted electric arrangement reminiscent of earlier Twickenham sessions</li>\n<li>Ultimately settled on acoustic, folk-rock approach</li>\n<li>Still in rehearsal phase</li>\n<li>Glyn Johns preserved several takes on multi-track tape</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Recording debuts:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Paul’s “Teddy Boy” (written in India previous year, briefly played January 9)</li>\n<li>John’s improvisational “Dig It” (blues-rock piece with ad-libbed lyrics)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Day rich in variety:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Paul experimenting with unreleased compositions: “Every Night,” “Hot As Sun”</li>\n<li>Paul played “There You Are, Eddie” (written previous December for Beatles biographer Hunter Davies)</li>\n<li>John played “Polythene Pam” (only time during these sessions)</li>\n<li>John revisited two Quarrymen-era songs: “Maggie Mae,” “Fancy My Chances With You”</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>George Harrison’s work:</strong> Minimal</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Limited to unreleased “Window, Window”</li>\n<li>Revisited on subsequent days but never saw official release</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Billy Preston’s late arrival:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Band returned to “Get Back”</li>\n<li>Session ran late, progress limited</li>\n<li>Deferred serious work on track for few days</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Evening activity:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Glyn Johns headed to Olympic Sound Studios</li>\n<li>Spent part of night mixing tracks recorded over past few days</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Weekend decision:</strong> Beatles decided to continue rehearsing over weekend</p>\n<p><strong>Glyn Johns reflection on “Teddy Boy”:</strong>\r\n“I loved [Teddy Boy], and I was hoping they’d finish it and do it, because I thought it was really good.

The package is great”</p>\n<p><strong>Paul McCartney:</strong> “It’s good”</p>\n<p><strong>John Lennon:</strong> “They’ll have slides, you know.

John even suggested inviting Billy to join band permanently, effectively becoming “fifth Beatle.” However, Paul not enthusiastic about idea, responding half-jokingly: “It’s just bad enough with four.”</p>\n<p><strong>John Lennon:</strong> “Did you tell Paul we’ve got Billy a contract?”</p>\n<p><strong>George Harrison:</strong> “No, not yet”</p>\n<p><strong>John Lennon:</strong> “We’ve got him off Capitol. Just like that. And George will produce him”</p>\n<p><strong>Paul McCartney:</strong> “I was just talking to him about that. I said, ‘What did you do after Hamburg and that?’ He said, ‘Well, I saw you guys go, sort of, ‘voomph’ to the moon’. And he sort of had a couple groups together. But he’s never, sort of, done his thing”</p>\n<p><strong>George Harrison:</strong> “The main thing, Billy just really is so knocked out, so thrilled doing it. And also he sees it’s his great opportunity”</p>\n<p><strong>Paul McCartney:</strong> “Then he puts his name and The Beatles. Like, it’s Billy Preston!”</p>\n<p><strong>George Harrison:</strong> “I didn’t think about it. We’ll have to decide about paying him. ‘Cause, if we were having Nicky Hopkins playing, we’d have to pay him session musician rates. Which will be…”</p>\n<p><strong>John Lennon:</strong> “This is, like, to be in the film and that”</p>\n<p><strong>Paul McCartney:</strong> “Yeah, we’ll just say to Ron, ‘Look, will you talk to Billy?’”</p>\n<p><strong>John Lennon:</strong> “On the film it happened so great. I mean, I’d just like him in our band, actually. I’d like a fifth Beatle. At Twickenham, suddenly, there was three, now there’s four of us, then there’s five!”</p>\n<p><strong>George Harrison:</strong> “We can do that, as well. If I asked Dylan to join The Beatles, and he would, as well, you know, and we get ‘em all in here!”</p>\n<p><strong>Paul McCartney:</strong> “Yeah, but they don’t need to join The Beatles”</p>\n<p><strong>John Lennon:</strong> “We’d call it The Beatles &#x26; Co. That’ll be our band”</p>\n<p><strong>George Harrison:</strong> “I mean, it’s Sergeant Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band, innit?”</p>\n<p><strong>John Lennon:</strong> “We could get ‘em all”</p>\n<p><strong>Paul McCartney:</strong> “I just don’t, because it’s just bad enough with four”</p>",{headings:4751,localImagePaths:4778,remoteImagePaths:4779,frontmatter:4780,imagePaths:4783},[4752,4755,4756,4757,4758,4761,4764,4767,4768,4771,4772,4775],{depth:89,slug:4753,text:4754},"day-15-overview-january-24-1969","Day 15 Overview (January 24, 1969)",{depth:64,slug:4551,text:4552},{depth:64,slug:4515,text:4516},{depth:47,slug:4452,text:4453},{depth:47,slug:4759,text:4760},"maggie-mae-traditional-arranged-lennon-mccartney-harrison-starkey","Maggie Mae (Traditional, arranged Lennon-McCartney-Harrison-Starkey)",{depth:47,slug:4762,text:4763},"dig-it-lennon-mccartney-harrison-starkey","Dig It (Lennon-McCartney-Harrison-Starkey)",{depth:47,slug:4765,text:4766},"teddy-boy-paul","Teddy Boy (Paul)",{depth:47,slug:4700,text:4701},{depth:47,slug:4769,text:4770},"other-songs","Other Songs",{depth:64,slug:4464,text:4465},{depth:47,slug:4773,text:4774},"conversation-1-book-idea-discussion","Conversation 1: Book Idea Discussion",{depth:47,slug:4776,text:4777},"conversation-2-billy-preston-contract--fifth-beatle-discussion","Conversation 2: Billy Preston Contract & “Fifth Beatle” Discussion",[],[],{title:4735,category:1789,date_range:3637,source:4736,reliability:1566,relevance:4737,tags:4781,created:4782},[1431,1795,1796,1797,4534,4535,3639,4423,4739,4740,4741,4742,4743],["Date","2025-12-20T00:00:00.000Z"],[],"get-back-dialogue-day-to-day/mccartney-website/day-15-overview.md","get-back-dialogue-day-to-day/mccartney-website/day-18-overview",{id:4785,data:4787,body:4795,filePath:4796,digest:4797,rendered:4798,legacyId:4840},{title:4788,category:1789,date_range:3808,source:4789,reliability:1566,relevance:4790,tags:4791,created:4794},"Get Back / Let It Be Sessions: Day 18 Overview (McCartney.com source)","McCartney.com official website, Peter Jackson's 'The Beatles: Get Back' (2021), beatlesebooks.com, 'a moral to this song' blog (tumblr.com), Ringo Starr 'Postcards from the boys' (2004), Mal Evans diary","Critical Monday session - recorded definitive 'Get Back' take (basis for single and album).

Asked Alistair [Taylor, Apple office manager] to get toasted sandwich machine\"\r\n\r\n**Ringo Starr reflection (Postcards from the boys, 2004):**\r\n\"Another great card from Paul. 1969 — by now everything was tough except the moments when we played and that was the saving grace. Once the music started we were always okay because we still did our best. Then afterwards there would be lots of heated discussions. Maybe this is before we had the big meeting at Brookfields where we asked George to come back to The Beatles after he'd left when Paul had really, really pissed him off at Twickenham\"\r\n\r\n### Main Songs Recorded\r\n\r\n#### Let It Be (Paul)\r\n\r\n**This session:** 12 more versions with Billy Preston\r\n\r\n**Arrangement status:** Final arrangement pretty set by this time\r\n- Did some experimentation this day\r\n\r\n**Experiments:**\r\n- Some versions: George and John played guitar and bass riffs during early part of song\r\n- Billy experimented with different organ parts\r\n- Even substituted electric piano instead of organ\r\n\r\n**After one soulful electric piano rendition:**\r\n- Paul remarks: \"Of course, coming from the North of England, it doesn't come through easy in all the soul\"\r\n- Prompts laugh from Billy\r\n\r\n**George's work:** Took time to work through lead guitar part during song's final chorus\r\n\r\n**Lyrics status:** Paul still didn't have lyrics to final set of verses written\r\n- Sometimes sang scat vocals\r\n- John adding what Bruce Spizer describes as \"inappropriate vocal ad-libs, perhaps out of boredom\"\r\n\r\n**\"Ploddy\" discussion (Get Back documentary series):**\r\n- After \"f bit\" played in one rehearsal, Paul states: \"It's a bit ploddy\"\r\n- John: \"What?\"\r\n- Paul: \"It just sorts of plods along a bit\"\r\n- John explains: \"It's just morning and slow; and a slow song. It takes a long time to get out of it\"\r\n- Paul relented: \"That'll do for the time being\" before moving on to \"The Long And Winding Road\" (also wasn't feeling inspired by this day)\r\n\r\n**Status:** With time frame to complete project nearing end, all that left was for Paul to complete lyrics - everyone pretty much had parts perfected\r\n\r\n#### The Long And Winding Road (Paul)\r\n\r\n**This session:** 6 rehearsals\r\n\r\n**Paul's mood:** Feeling bit down after attempts at \"Let It Be\"\r\n- Thought to change gears, put in more work on other ballad\r\n- Introduced tune as \"The Wrong And Winding Box\"\r\n\r\n**Performances:** Bruce Spizer describes as \"a few deliberately off-the-wall performances, including one in which John did most of the singing and Paul mimicked Al Jolson\"\r\n\r\n**Serious attempt decision:** Made to record serious attempt to see if could better previous day's version\r\n- Featured Ringo using brushes, many times performing fast snare drum rolls\r\n- John came in on backing vocals twice during lines \"still they lead me back\"\r\n\r\n**Paul's discouraged mood continued:**\r\n- \"It's like the other one\" (in reference to \"Let It Be\")\r\n- \"Slow, ballady and like they're plodding a bit…I can't, sort of, think how to do this one at all, y'know. My mind's a blank on it. I don't know. Dunno. Give up!\"\r\n- Moved directly into working on other songs, including recording official released version of \"Get Back\" (lifted morale very nicely)\r\n\r\n**Control room discussion (end of day):**\r\n- Paul: \"The two slow ones, 'Mother Mary' and 'Brother Jesus,' they haven't happened yet\" (meaning neither \"Let It Be\" nor \"The Long And Winding Road\" recorded properly yet)\r\n- **Glyn Johns still pushing for using January 26th recording** as he'd done previous day\r\n- Glyn Johns explains: \"I think it's very tasty\"\r\n- Paul: \"Oh, the little version we...?\"\r\n- Glyn Johns insists: \"I'm not saying you can't do it better, I'm saying it's very together\"\r\n- **Glyn Johns got his way in end**\r\n\r\n#### Get Back (Paul)\r\n\r\n**This session:** 32 renditions recorded\r\n- Most officially recorded by George Martin and engineers Glyn Johns and Alan Parsons\r\n\r\n**Before tapes rolling:**\r\n- Beatles and Billy Preston ran through song few times for rehearsal\r\n- Eventually confident ready to record definitive version\r\n\r\n**John's guitar intro (Get Back series):**\r\n- Seen slapping guitar strings during introduction\r\n- Part strategically increasing in volume as progressed\r\n\r\n**Fast tempo rendition:**\r\n- Paul singing first verse in mock Japanese\r\n- Including phrase \"sock it to me\" (residual from obsession with American TV show \"Rowan & Martin's Laugh In,\" referenced many times in January 1969 rehearsals/recording sessions)\r\n\r\n**Tapes rolling - many good takes recorded:**\r\n- After roughly estimated \"take 9\" (may actually have been \"take 18\")\r\n- Paul's exclamation \"nearly\" caught on tape (suggesting getting close)\r\n- McCartney's vocal hijinks this day may indicate being under influence of some substance\r\n- Knowledge that releasable take recorded this day indicates this ended up being good idea in long run\r\n\r\n**Variations:**\r\n- Varying guitar solos from John\r\n- Slight tempo alterations per George Martin's and Paul's suggestions\r\n- Suitable atmosphere to achieve acceptable master take\r\n\r\n**Coda experiments:**\r\n- One rendition: Paul sang \"it's five o'clock, your mother's got your tea on, take your cap off, sit down, you're bloody not coming in\"\r\n- Another take: \"one, two, three o'clock, four o'clock rock\" from Bill Haley's \"Rock Around The Clock\"\r\n\r\n**DEFINITIVE SINGLE AND ALBUM VERSION:**\r\n- Eventually recorded this day\r\n- **Just before performance began, John humorously remarked:** \"Sweet Loretta Fart (pronounced in Liverpudlian accent) she thought she was a cleaner, but she was a frying pan…picks with his fingers\"\r\n- **This vocal segment, along with extraneous studio sounds, included on released soundtrack album**\r\n\r\n**The take following \"Sweet Loretta Fart\":**\r\n- Ended up becoming basis for both single and album\r\n- **Rehearsed coda not played** - Ringo forgetting to come back in after break near song's conclusion\r\n- After Paul sings iconic \"oooh,\" George states: \"We missed that end, didn't we?\"\r\n- George Martin: \"I thought you were going on. Do you want to end it like that?\"\r\n- **Ringo replied:** \"Just Plug it on – the best end we did\"\r\n\r\n**Although flubbed ending propelled into multiple new recorded versions:**\r\n- Above mentioned take ultimately deemed best\r\n\r\n**Later recordings:**\r\n- One rendition with pseudo-German lyrics throughout\r\n- Acknowledging Jackie Lomax influence with phrase \"Yah, that's good, Jackie\"\r\n- Final verse in mock French\r\n- Very entertaining, eventually gracing various bootleg releases\r\n- Obvious they'd previously recorded definitive version this day\r\n- Celebrating event in rather unconventional way\r\n\r\n#### Old Brown Shoe (George)\r\n\r\n**This session:** Introduced - written previous night\r\n- Performed on piano\r\n- Later rehearsed with Paul, Ringo and Billy Preston after John stepped out to grab food\r\n- Band's first attempt at song\r\n- Later released as b-side to \"The Ballad of John and Yoko\"\r\n\r\n#### Don't Let Me Down (John)\r\n\r\n**This session:** Several takes\r\n- None considered refined enough to move forward\r\n\r\n#### Oh, Darling (Paul)\r\n\r\n**This session:** Attempts\r\n- Track later appeared on Abbey Road album\r\n- One released in edited form on \"Anthology 3\" (1996)\r\n\r\n#### I've Got A Feeling (Paul + John composite)\r\n\r\n**This session:** Several attempts at session close\r\n- One mixed by Glyn Johns for his \"Get Back\" album (March 1969)\r\n\r\n### Chronological Conversations\r\n\r\n#### Conversation 1: Morning - Glyn Johns' Police Encounter & Paul's Stories\r\n\r\n**Context:** From 'a moral to this song' blog - As Glyn Johns grouses about having been apprehended by police on petty driving charge (causing him to be late), Paul commiserates and humorously shares own peeved exchanges with policemen on road.\r\n\r\n**Paul:** \"Let me take you down, 'cause I'm going to…\"\r\n\r\n**Glyn:** \"Can you believe that bleeding copper! [stuffy voice] 'Oh, alright, I'll have to report this, you know, anything you say will be taken down,' and it went through all that!\"\r\n\r\n**John:** \"Have you got a fag?\"\r\n\r\n**Glyn:** \"Yeah\"\r\n\r\n**Paul:** \"I had a terrible scene the other day on the motorway with a copper. 'Cause they stopped me, and I – I don't like it, getting stopped by police. I always get – I get obnoxious with them, you know. [Yoko laughs] 'Cause I'll just sort of check around to see if I'm in the right, and once I know I am, and they've stopped me, I get very… But they just stopped me because I was hogging the outside lane, and you're not supposed to do that. So he said, 'You did, you know.' You're going seventy. You've got to stay out there, but you're not supposed to get back in. So he stopped me, and then it really got sort of nasty after a bit. 'Cause Linda just had her hand round the back of my head, and then he said, 'You can't possibly be in – in control!'\"\r\n\r\n**Yoko:** [laughs] \"Oh, no\"\r\n\r\n**Paul:** \"'You see how that young lady was fondling the back of your neck…' [uproarious laughter] And I said, 'Oh, what's up with you, then? Don't you get it?' [laughter] You know, and it got really like that. 'Oh! You can't book me for that, Constable!' You know, it got really sort of… 'Oh, can't I!' [laughter] And of course, my tax. [laughs] They got me. My tax wasn't up to date and all\"\r\n\r\n**John:** \"Don't they just do it at the office for us?\"\r\n\r\n**Paul:** \"No\"\r\n\r\n**John:** \"Oh. I probably haven't had one done since I started, then\" [laughter]\r\n\r\n**Paul:** \"They keep doing that. I was going through Mersey Tunnel, and they keep stopping me in the Mersey Tunnel 'cause they see you and they just want an autograph.

But we may have a four-take wonder!\"\r\n\r\n**Mood:** Work on \"For Your Blue\" lifted mood of band considerably\r\n\r\n**Take 1 (Anthology 3, 1996):**\r\n- Paul on piano instead of George's acoustic guitar\r\n- Others join shortly thereafter\r\n- Impressive performance\r\n- Paul playing piano in straightforward bluesy style covering bass notes (no bass guitar)\r\n- Only one verse used for solo (John's slide guitar focal point)\r\n- George inadvertently ends singing: \"I love you more each moment I'm with you\"\r\n- John concluding rather awkwardly, causing him to chuckle\r\n\r\n**Take 2 onward:**\r\n- George decided to include four-measure acoustic guitar intro\r\n- Explaining to John: \"OK, just make it one on each\"\r\n- Decision made to lengthen song: second solo verse added after John's (Paul showcased on piano)\r\n- George's guitar intro extended to five measures (additional measure added at end)\r\n\r\n**Take 3:**\r\n- George forgets to allow Paul solo verse, begins singing\r\n- John shouts \"Piano!\"\r\n- George sheepishly recites: \"I've loved that piano from the moment that I saw you\"\r\n\r\n**Take 6:**\r\n- Used for Apple studio performance in Let It Be movie\r\n- Ringo progressed to using sticks instead of brushes\r\n- Paul relinquished traditional bluesy piano style for quirky chording on higher keys\r\n- Leaving bass tones to John on lap steel guitar\r\n- George asked for \"bad honky tonk piano\" sound\r\n- McCartney intertwined paper between piano strings\r\n- Effect clearly heard on released recording\r\n\r\n**Take 7:**\r\n- George performing guitar intro but Paul forgot fifth measure, came in early - replied \"Just as well\"\r\n- After someone rattles ice in drinking glass, George tries twice more to get intro done correctly but fails\r\n- After John humorously yells \"QUIET PLEASE,\" George nails intro\r\n- **Beatles perform near flawless rendition**\r\n- **This version appealed to all**\r\n- Being perfectionists, decided to record five more renditions in case could do better\r\n\r\n**Take 9:**\r\n- Quite good\r\n- Solo section used in Let It Be movie as backdrop to all four Beatles arriving individually at Apple Building\r\n- Segment cuts to group performing Take 6\r\n\r\n**Take 12:**\r\n- Excellent performance showing clearly enjoying recording process\r\n- To introduce Paul's solo verse, George says \"Mr. Bluthner\" (reference to Bluthner grand piano he was playing)\r\n- During solo, John yells \"Yes, Jim\" expressing approval\r\n- All congratulate themselves for possibly best rendition yet\r\n- George: \"It felt nice!\"\r\n- John joked about slide guitar work: \"A few genuine Jimmy Reed slips there!

Told others he'd watched finished film previous evening.\r\n\r\n**George Harrison:** \"What were we doing?\"\r\n\r\n**Paul McCartney:** \"We, uh… I don't really know, you know? But it's like we totally, sort of, put our own personalities under, for the sake of it. And you can really see, you know, we're all…\"\r\n\r\n**John Lennon:** \"Who's writing all them songs?\"\r\n\r\n**Paul McCartney:** \"That was probably when we did…\"\r\n\r\n**John Lennon:** \"In your room\"\r\n\r\n**Paul McCartney:** \"Yeah. Right. I remember, yeah. But just sort of… There's a…\"\r\n\r\n**George Harrison:** \"Do you regret having gone there?\"\r\n\r\n**Paul McCartney:** \"No, no. Oh, no. I just think, what we did there, we weren't really very truthful there. You know, things like sneaking behind [The Maharishi's] back and sort of saying, 'It's a bit like school, isn't it?' But you can see on the film that it is very like school\"\r\n\r\n**John Lennon:** \"You want to call it 'What We Did On Our Holidays'?\"\r\n\r\n**Paul McCartney:** \"But it is very like that. There's a long shot of you, sort of, walking with him. And it's just not you, you know?\"\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n#### Conversation 3: Planning Week Ahead - Glyn's Honeymoon\r\n\r\n**Context:** Conversation shifted to planning for week ahead before Glyn Johns departed for honeymoon.\r\n\r\n**Glyn Johns:** \"What we could do is get one number done, right? Ready for… do it. Film it and do it, right? And then move on to the next one, get that one ready, finish it, do it\"\r\n\r\n**Mal Evans:** \"Starting now, you mean?\"\r\n\r\n**Glyn Johns:** \"Starting whenever, yeah\"\r\n\r\n**George Harrison:** \"Have we got to have this album recorded by Tuesday then? Is that the idea? We're just gonna record them all until we've got them all before Tuesday when Glyn goes? Is that it?\"\r\n\r\n**Glyn Johns:** \"I'll now go on Thursday, in fact\"\r\n\r\n**Paul McCartney:** \"I thought the idea was to get 'em all known by Tuesday\"\r\n\r\n**George Harrison:** \"So Wednesday night, we've recorded…\"\r\n\r\n**Glyn Johns:** \"I've gotta mix… I'd like to mix 'em before I go too…\"\r\n\r\n**George Harrison:** \"Are we still doing the show?\"\r\n\r\n**Paul McCartney:** \"I don't know, really\"\r\n\r\n**John Lennon:** \"Say we did eight or nine, he'll come back after about a week or something. That's if we don't get 14 done by Tuesday\"\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n#### Conversation 4: Live Show Feasibility - Paul's Frustration (EXTENSIVE)\r\n\r\n**Context:** Discussed feasibility of still doing live show. Conversation took tense turn for Paul, who expressed frustration other Beatles lacked enthusiasm for live performance (though John insisted he'd be on board, suggesting George and Ringo weren't interested). Paul voiced concerns about unstructured nature of project, lamenting evolving from TV show into film without being shot in 35mm (would compromise professional quality). Criticized lack of clear climax for envisioned film, initially intended to culminate in live performance.\r\n\r\n**Michael Lindsay-Hogg:** \"Originally, it was a show and an album. A live album recorded when the show was actually live on the spot. And what I think is lacking at the moment is the show\"\r\n\r\n**John Lennon:** \"I would dig to play onstage, you know? I mean, if it was all… everything was all right and there was no messing and we're just gonna play onstage. You know, that's why I said yes to the TV show. I didn't want the hell of doing it, but nobody else wants to go on the stage or do a TV show. You know, that's what it's about. Nobody wants to get out there. You know?\"\r\n\r\n**Paul McCartney:** \"I suppose that's true, you know?\"\r\n\r\n**John Lennon:** \"I think so, you know? I'm only going by what's happened\"\r\n\r\n**Paul McCartney:** \"Yeah, yeah\"\r\n\r\n**John Lennon:** \"What are you trying to make a show out of now?\"\r\n\r\n**Paul McCartney:** \"I can't answer it, you know?\"\r\n\r\n**John Lennon:** \"I know. I know that there's no sort of answer for it, but…\"\r\n\r\n**George Harrison:** \"The things that have worked out best ever for us haven't really been planned any more than this has. It's just, you know, it's like you just go into something and it does it itself. You know, whatever it's gonna be, it becomes that, you know?\"\r\n\r\n**John Lennon:** \"See, it's turned out it's not what Paul wants. It's like if it's… Say it's his number, this whole show. It's actually turned into our number more than his number. That's all. And, uh… It's just that, really\"\r\n\r\n**Paul McCartney:** \"Yeah, I know, it is majority decisions and all. Yeah\"\r\n\r\n**John Lennon:** \"We're presuming that we are gonna make this LP anyway as one whole piece, like as if the cameras aren't here. But it might be an idea to sort of face 'em… For the singing. The point of doing it all in one go is that we're aware of the camera. So we should look at the camera. And we sing it straight to 'em. You know? And… The finale'd just be us doing the numbers well… What do you think?\"\r\n\r\n**Glyn Johns:** \"The main thing is to do the change from the acoustic numbers to the electric numbers\"\r\n\r\n**John Lennon:** \"I mean, if we're doing a stage show, we'd have to… 'Hold on a sec, ladies and gentlemen, George just getting on his Rickenbacker.'\"\r\n\r\n**Glyn Johns:** \"As far as I'm concerned, I would need one run-through on each number to get the balance set for it, 'cause it's all… everything's changing\"\r\n\r\n**John Lennon:** \"We'll know that better as soon as we've got an order… Soon as we've got a story\"\r\n\r\n**Paul McCartney:** \"It's all right, but I'd meant to sort of put the songs to some other framework this time. That's what I'd sort of thought. That we'd just keep to the same environment, totally… always, you know? We don't ever attempt to break out of it. We… We're in a recording studio again in London making another album, you know?\"\r\n\r\n**George Harrison:** \"I think this is the nicest place I've been for a long time, this studio\"\r\n\r\n**Paul McCartney:** \"Yeah, it is\"\r\n\r\n**George Harrison:** \"No, really, you know, I mean. And also we've played… This is the most I've ever played by playing every day. And I can just feel myself getting… My fingers getting loose a bit. But really I just want to play. That's what it was about\"\r\n\r\n**Glyn Johns:** \"What we've got is you all playing live in one room. That in itself is a fresh thing for The Beatles\"\r\n\r\n**Paul McCartney:** \"Mmm\"\r\n\r\n**Michael Lindsay-Hogg:** \"Are you gonna just stay around in a circle?\"\r\n\r\n**John Lennon:** \"Unless we felt like standing up 'cause it was a shouter, you know?\"\r\n\r\n**Michael Lindsay-Hogg:** \"No matter what we do, it's still gonna look like you're sitting in a room making the album. It's not per se a show\"\r\n\r\n**John Lennon:** \"All we've got is us, and the documentary, where we happen to be singing. I mean, you see what happens when we're just grooving to the music. The whole place changes\"\r\n\r\n**Paul McCartney:** \"Yeah, that's true\"\r\n\r\n**John Lennon:** \"And that… If we're doing them well on the day, without anything… it should come over. We've gotta do it, you know?\"\r\n\r\n**Michael Lindsay-Hogg:** \"And also, remember, the original idea was a TV show and then a documentary about it. And now it's changed to being a movie\"\r\n\r\n**Paul McCartney:** \"It's like, really, if we're gonna do a film for cinema, it should've been done on 35 millimeters, which is just the best quality. We shot this on 16 because it's a television thing\"\r\n\r\n**John Lennon:** \"Just the still photos would make a UA movie with soundtrack on it, you know?\"\r\n\r\n**George Harrison:** \"I think we should blow it up to 35 and if they don't take it, they're fucking fools. Because they're not gonna get anything else, are they?\"\r\n\r\n**Paul McCartney:** \"Unless we've got incredible quality on this, 16 blown to 35 is a mess\"\r\n\r\n**George Harrison:** \"No, it's not. There's a certain stock that blows up better\"\r\n\r\n**John Lennon:** \"Ektachrome 500\"\r\n\r\n**Michael Lindsay-Hogg:** \"Yeah, this will blow up all right, this film\"\r\n\r\n**Paul McCartney:** \"I don't know what it is that I'm moaning about, but it's just sort of…\"\r\n\r\n**Glyn Johns:** \"I must admit I can't really see it either, because it's… It just seems the last two days everything's gone so ridiculously well\"\r\n\r\n**John Lennon:** \"He's right, you know\"\r\n\r\n**(Various people together):** \"It is good. It's going great. It really is something. It's true though\"\r\n\r\n**Paul McCartney:** \"I just have a feeling that we… It's all right, you know? It's nothing to complain about, but… But it's just funny to sort of realize that after this is all over, you'll be off in a black bag somewhere on the Albert Hall, you know?\"\r\n\r\n**John Lennon:** \"Yeah\"\r\n\r\n**Michael Lindsay-Hogg:** \"What you're moaning about is there's no payoff\"\r\n\r\n**Paul McCartney:** \"I think all I wanna do is, like, uh… I probably, you know, having got it together, I probably just wanna go and have fun with it. Rather than just, sort of, finish off exactly as we started. And I'd like to sort of do a… for the finish. And we just get out in the open, change of scene, and go and do it somewhere else, do it on a live show, do it on a stage. You know, I'd like to light a rocket and really sort of take off for the end of it. And, uh, you know… but that's going a bit, like, overboard, I suppose. But that's me, you know? I always do that\"\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n#### Conversation 5: Rooftop Concert Proposal\r\n\r\n**Context:** Later in session, Michael Lindsay-Hogg and Glyn Johns proposed idea that could give Paul live performance he was hoping for: Beatles could perform on rooftop of Apple building. Around lunchtime, Paul, Ringo, Glyn Johns, Michael Lindsay-Hogg, and others made way to rooftop to assess feasibility.\r\n\r\n**Michael Lindsay-Hogg:** \"The only thing is we've got to get some permission, Paul. So the cops don't come and throw us off, that's all\"\r\n\r\n**Ringo Starr:** \"What happens if we go on top of the other roof?\"\r\n\r\n**Michael Lindsay-Hogg:** \"If it's somebody else's roof, then we can get had not only for disturbing the peace and the noise, but also for trespassing\"\r\n\r\n**Mal Evans:** \"Now, um, good. So, but just roughly timewise, so I can look into gear…\"\r\n\r\n**Paul McCartney:** \"Yeah. So, okay, look, if we say like on Friday or something\"\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Glyn Johns & Michael Lindsay-Hogg on Rooftop Idea\r\n\r\n**Glyn Johns (Sound Man memoir, 2014):**\r\n\"A couple of days later we were all having lunch on the third floor. Ringo and I were in conversation about the building and its attributes and he asked me if I had ever been up on the roof, saying it had a wonderful view of the West End of London. So he took me and Michael Lindsay-Hogg up there, showing us a large area of flat roof with wonderful views of the city stretching away to the southwest. I suggested that if they wanted to play to a large crowd, why not play on the roof to the whole of the West End. We went back downstairs and put it to the others, and after some discussion, it was agreed. As the Savile Row police station was only a couple of hundred yards away we knew the concert would probably not last long, but the police stopping it would all be part of the fun\"\r\n\r\n**Michael Lindsay-Hogg (Rolling Stone, Nov 2, 2021):**\r\n\"In your recollection, playing on the roof was your idea, right?\r\n\r\nI figured it was my job to say we need a place we're going to, we need a place to end, we need a conclusion. And that's when I said, 'Why don't we do it on the roof?' Because I thought that was part of my job, to offer them choices. Because it wasn't that they lacked ideas or imagination. God, no. But you had to help focus them because they had a million other things to do, including making an album\"\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n#### Conversation 6: Scheduling Rooftop Concert\r\n\r\n**Context:** Back in studio, conversation resulted in decision to tentatively schedule rooftop concert for Wednesday, January 29, 1969 (date ultimately changed to January 30).\r\n\r\n**Michael Lindsay-Hogg:** \"I think the thing is we'll aim for Thursday\"\r\n\r\n**George Harrison:** \"Are we gonna do it all here now?\"\r\n\r\n**George Martin:** \"I think you should aim for a little earlier than Thursday. 'Cause if you aim for Thursday, it's not gonna be Thursday\"\r\n\r\n**Paul McCartney:** \"See, we have to give them a chance to get their other cameras in\"\r\n\r\n**Michael Lindsay-Hogg / Ringo Starr:** \"Aim for Wednesday\"\r\n\r\n**Paul McCartney:** \"It'll be pretty quick, but it'll still give us some time to do it\"","src/content/research/get-back-dialogue-day-to-day/mccartney-website/day-16-overview.md","045dafe78285d6df",{html:4854,metadata:4855},"<h2 id=\"day-16-overview-january-25-1969\">Day 16 Overview (January 25, 1969)</h2>\n<p>Sixteenth day of “Get Back” sessions -

I just think, what we did there, we weren’t really very truthful there.

Conversation took tense turn for Paul, who expressed frustration other Beatles lacked enthusiasm for live performance (though John insisted he’d be on board, suggesting George and Ringo weren’t interested). Paul voiced concerns about unstructured nature of project, lamenting evolving from TV show into film without being shot in 35mm (would compromise professional quality). Criticized lack of clear climax for envisioned film, initially intended to culminate in live performance.</p>\n<p><strong>Michael Lindsay-Hogg:</strong> “Originally, it was a show and an album. A live album recorded when the show was actually live on the spot. And what I think is lacking at the moment is the show”</p>\n<p><strong>John Lennon:</strong> “I would dig to play onstage, you know? I mean, if it was all… everything was all right and there was no messing and we’re just gonna play onstage. You know, that’s why I said yes to the TV show. I didn’t want the hell of doing it, but nobody else wants to go on the stage or do a TV show. You know, that’s what it’s about. Nobody wants to get out there. You know?”</p>\n<p><strong>Paul McCartney:</strong> “I suppose that’s true, you know?”</p>\n<p><strong>John Lennon:</strong> “I think so, you know? I’m only going by what’s happened”</p>\n<p><strong>Paul McCartney:</strong> “Yeah, yeah”</p>\n<p><strong>John Lennon:</strong> “What are you trying to make a show out of now?”</p>\n<p><strong>Paul McCartney:</strong> “I can’t answer it, you know?”</p>\n<p><strong>John Lennon:</strong> “I know. I know that there’s no sort of answer for it, but…”</p>\n<p><strong>George Harrison:</strong> “The things that have worked out best ever for us haven’t really been planned any more than this has. It’s just, you know, it’s like you just go into something and it does it itself. You know, whatever it’s gonna be, it becomes that, you know?”</p>\n<p><strong>John Lennon:</strong> “See, it’s turned out it’s not what Paul wants. It’s like if it’s… Say it’s his number, this whole show. It’s actually turned into our number more than his number. That’s all. And, uh… It’s just that, really”</p>\n<p><strong>Paul McCartney:</strong> “Yeah, I know, it is majority decisions and all. Yeah”</p>\n<p><strong>John Lennon:</strong> “We’re presuming that we are gonna make this LP anyway as one whole piece, like as if the cameras aren’t here. But it might be an idea to sort of face ‘em… For the singing. The point of doing it all in one go is that we’re aware of the camera. So we should look at the camera. And we sing it straight to ‘em. You know? And… The finale’d just be us doing the numbers well… What do you think?”</p>\n<p><strong>Glyn Johns:</strong> “The main thing is to do the change from the acoustic numbers to the electric numbers”</p>\n<p><strong>John Lennon:</strong> “I mean, if we’re doing a stage show, we’d have to… ‘Hold on a sec, ladies and gentlemen, George just getting on his Rickenbacker.’”</p>\n<p><strong>Glyn Johns:</strong> “As far as I’m concerned, I would need one run-through on each number to get the balance set for it, ‘cause it’s all… everything’s changing”</p>\n<p><strong>John Lennon:</strong> “We’ll know that better as soon as we’ve got an order… Soon as we’ve got a story”</p>\n<p><strong>Paul McCartney:</strong> “It’s all right, but I’d meant to sort of put the songs to some other framework this time. That’s what I’d sort of thought. That we’d just keep to the same environment, totally… always, you know? We don’t ever attempt to break out of it. We… We’re in a recording studio again in London making another album, you know?”</p>\n<p><strong>George Harrison:</strong> “I think this is the nicest place I’ve been for a long time, this studio”</p>\n<p><strong>Paul McCartney:</strong> “Yeah, it is”</p>\n<p><strong>George Harrison:</strong> “No, really, you know, I mean. And also we’ve played… This is the most I’ve ever played by playing every day. And I can just feel myself getting… My fingers getting loose a bit. But really I just want to play. That’s what it was about”</p>\n<p><strong>Glyn Johns:</strong> “What we’ve got is you all playing live in one room. That in itself is a fresh thing for The Beatles”</p>\n<p><strong>Paul McCartney:</strong> “Mmm”</p>\n<p><strong>Michael Lindsay-Hogg:</strong> “Are you gonna just stay around in a circle?”</p>\n<p><strong>John Lennon:</strong> “Unless we felt like standing up ‘cause it was a shouter, you know?”</p>\n<p><strong>Michael Lindsay-Hogg:</strong> “No matter what we do, it’s still gonna look like you’re sitting in a room making the album. It’s not per se a show”</p>\n<p><strong>John Lennon:</strong> “All we’ve got is us, and the documentary, where we happen to be singing. I mean, you see what happens when we’re just grooving to the music. The whole place changes”</p>\n<p><strong>Paul McCartney:</strong> “Yeah, that’s true”</p>\n<p><strong>John Lennon:</strong> “And that… If we’re doing them well on the day, without anything… it should come over. We’ve gotta do it, you know?”</p>\n<p><strong>Michael Lindsay-Hogg:</strong> “And also, remember, the original idea was a TV show and then a documentary about it. And now it’s changed to being a movie”</p>\n<p><strong>Paul McCartney:</strong> “It’s like, really, if we’re gonna do a film for cinema, it should’ve been done on 35 millimeters, which is just the best quality. We shot this on 16 because it’s a television thing”</p>\n<p><strong>John Lennon:</strong> “Just the still photos would make a UA movie with soundtrack on it, you know?”</p>\n<p><strong>George Harrison:</strong> “I think we should blow it up to 35 and if they don’t take it, they’re fucking fools. Because they’re not gonna get anything else, are they?”</p>\n<p><strong>Paul McCartney:</strong> “Unless we’ve got incredible quality on this, 16 blown to 35 is a mess”</p>\n<p><strong>George Harrison:</strong> “No, it’s not.

Around lunchtime, Paul, Ringo, Glyn Johns, Michael Lindsay-Hogg, and others made way to rooftop to assess feasibility.</p>\n<p><strong>Michael Lindsay-Hogg:</strong> “The only thing is we’ve got to get some permission, Paul. So the cops don’t come and throw us off, that’s all”</p>\n<p><strong>Ringo Starr:</strong> “What happens if we go on top of the other roof?”</p>\n<p><strong>Michael Lindsay-Hogg:</strong> “If it’s somebody else’s roof, then we can get had not only for disturbing the peace and the noise, but also for trespassing”</p>\n<p><strong>Mal Evans:</strong> “Now, um, good. So, but just roughly timewise, so I can look into gear…”</p>\n<p><strong>Paul McCartney:</strong> “Yeah. So, okay, look, if we say like on Friday or something”</p>\n<hr>\n<h3 id=\"glyn-johns--michael-lindsay-hogg-on-rooftop-idea\">Glyn Johns &#x26; Michael Lindsay-Hogg on Rooftop Idea</h3>\n<p><strong>Glyn Johns (Sound Man memoir, 2014):</strong>\r\n“A couple of days later we were all having lunch on the third floor. Ringo and I were in conversation about the building and its attributes and he asked me if I had ever been up on the roof, saying it had a wonderful view of the West End of London. So he took me and Michael Lindsay-Hogg up there, showing us a large area of flat roof with wonderful views of the city stretching away to the southwest. I suggested that if they wanted to play to a large crowd, why not play on the roof to the whole of the West End. We went back downstairs and put it to the others, and after some discussion, it was agreed. As the Savile Row police station was only a couple of hundred yards away we knew the concert would probably not last long, but the police stopping it would all be part of the fun”</p>\n<p><strong>Michael Lindsay-Hogg (Rolling Stone, Nov 2, 2021):</strong>\r\n“In your recollection, playing on the roof was your idea, right?</p>\n<p>I figured it was my job to say we need a place we’re going to, we need a place to end, we need a conclusion. And that’s when I said, ‘Why don’t we do it on the roof?’ Because I thought that was part of my job, to offer them choices. Because it wasn’t that they lacked ideas or imagination. God, no. But you had to help focus them because they had a million other things to do, including making an album”</p>\n<hr>\n<h4 id=\"conversation-6-scheduling-rooftop-concert\">Conversation 6: Scheduling Rooftop Concert</h4>\n<p><strong>Context:</strong> Back in studio, conversation resulted in decision to tentatively schedule rooftop concert for Wednesday, January 29, 1969 (date ultimately changed to January 30).</p>\n<p><strong>Michael Lindsay-Hogg:</strong> “I think the thing is we’ll aim for Thursday”</p>\n<p><strong>George Harrison:</strong> “Are we gonna do it all here now?”</p>\n<p><strong>George Martin:</strong> “I think you should aim for a little earlier than Thursday. ‘Cause if you aim for Thursday, it’s not gonna be Thursday”</p>\n<p><strong>Paul McCartney:</strong> “See, we have to give them a chance to get their other cameras in”</p>\n<p><strong>Michael Lindsay-Hogg / Ringo Starr:</strong> “Aim for Wednesday”</p>\n<p><strong>Paul McCartney:</strong> “It’ll be pretty quick, but it’ll still give us some time to do it”</p>",{headings:4856,localImagePaths:4890,remoteImagePaths:4891,frontmatter:4892,imagePaths:4895},[4857,4860,4861,4862,4863,4866,4867,4868,4869,4872,4875,4878,4881,4884,4887],{depth:89,slug:4858,text:4859},"day-16-overview-january-25-1969","Day 16 Overview (January 25, 1969)",{depth:64,slug:4551,text:4552},{depth:64,slug:4515,text:4516},{depth:47,slug:4452,text:4453},{depth:47,slug:4864,text:4865},"for-you-blue-george","For You Blue (George)",{depth:47,slug:4808,text:4809},{depth:47,slug:4769,text:4770},{depth:64,slug:4464,text:4465},{depth:47,slug:4870,text:4871},"conversation-1-billy-preston-absent","Conversation 1: Billy Preston Absent",{depth:47,slug:4873,text:4874},"conversation-2-india-trip-home-movies","Conversation 2: India Trip Home Movies",{depth:47,slug:4876,text:4877},"conversation-3-planning-week-ahead---glyns-honeymoon","Conversation 3: Planning Week Ahead - Glyn’s Honeymoon",{depth:47,slug:4879,text:4880},"conversation-4-live-show-feasibility---pauls-frustration-extensive","Conversation 4: Live Show Feasibility - Paul’s Frustration (EXTENSIVE)",{depth:47,slug:4882,text:4883},"conversation-5-rooftop-concert-proposal","Conversation 5: Rooftop Concert Proposal",{depth:64,slug:4885,text:4886},"glyn-johns--michael-lindsay-hogg-on-rooftop-idea","Glyn Johns & Michael Lindsay-Hogg on Rooftop Idea",{depth:47,slug:4888,text:4889},"conversation-6-scheduling-rooftop-concert","Conversation 6: Scheduling Rooftop Concert",[],[],{title:4844,category:1789,date_range:3719,source:4845,reliability:1566,relevance:4846,tags:4893,created:4894},[1431,1795,1796,1797,4534,4535,3721,4423,4793,4848],["Date","2025-12-20T00:00:00.000Z"],[],"get-back-dialogue-day-to-day/mccartney-website/day-16-overview.md","get-back-dialogue-day-to-day/mccartney-website/day-17-overview",{id:4897,data:4899,body:4908,filePath:4909,digest:4910,rendered:4911,legacyId:4936},{title:4900,category:1789,date_range:3761,source:4901,reliability:1566,relevance:4902,tags:4903,created:4907},"Get Back / Let It Be Sessions: Day 17 Overview (McCartney.com source)","McCartney.com official website, Peter Jackson's 'The Beatles: Get Back' (2021), beatlesebooks.com","Sunday session - first time working both weekend days in nearly a year.

Paul mentioned considering adding strings to track. <strong>Notable for two reasons:</strong> (1) Get Back sessions conceived with strict “no overdubs” rule, (2) When Phil Spector asked to produce album from Get Back sessions in 1970, he added strings to “The Long And Winding Road” - decision caused Paul’s ire upon hearing Spector’s version.</p>\n<p><strong>George Martin:</strong> “Paul’s thinking of having strings anyway”</p>\n<p><strong>George Harrison:</strong> “Paul, are you gonna have strings?”</p>\n<p><strong>Paul McCartney:</strong> “Dunno”</p>\n<p><strong>George Martin:</strong> “George was saying that the piano and the electric piano tends to be doing the same thing”</p>\n<p><strong>Paul McCartney:</strong> “Yeah”</p>\n<p><strong>George Harrison:</strong> “Well, it’s like – There’s only parts where you can hear the electric piano properly, or the piano properly”</p>\n<p><strong>Paul McCartney:</strong> “Yes”</p>\n<p><strong>George Harrison:</strong> “Most of the time, you know, like, they mix together”</p>\n<p><strong>George Martin:</strong> “Like your Leslie guitar contributes too.

Listen, now. We're gonna have to sort of bring it together, 'cause we're all at odds. We're doing that thing we did on 'The Beatles'. Like, in this verse, it's two harmonies singing, trying to say some words, right?\"\r\n\r\n**John Lennon:** \"I'm not that bothered. I'm just trying to sing it\"\r\n\r\n**Paul McCartney:** \"It's not sounding together\"\r\n\r\n**George Harrison:** \"And so we can only play until we find the bit\"\r\n\r\n**Paul McCartney:** \"Or we can stop and say it's not together\"\r\n\r\n**George Harrison:** \"Yes, then you've got to carry on until it gets together\"\r\n\r\n**John Lennon:** \"These are the hard ones to do, aren't they?\"\r\n\r\n**Paul McCartney:** \"No, not really, it's just... We've got to be imaginative. You know, it's complicated now. See, if we can get it simpler and then complicate it where it needs complication, but it's complicated in the bit...\"\r\n\r\n**George Harrison:** \"It's not complicated. I'll play just the chords, if you like\"\r\n\r\n**Paul McCartney:** \"No, no, come on. You always get annoyed when I say that. I'm trying to help, you know. But I always hear myself annoying you, and I'm trying...\"\r\n\r\n**George Harrison:** \"No, you're not annoying me. You don't annoy me anymore\"\r\n\r\n**Paul McCartney:** \"But you see what I mean. We do this then... Then I don't know\" [...]\r\n\r\n**Paul McCartney:** \"I'm scared of me being the boss. And I have been for a couple of years. I always feel as though I'm trying to put you down and stop you playing. But I'm not. I'm trying to stop us all playing, until we know what we're playing\"\r\n\r\n**George Harrison:** \"But you've got to play in order to find which fits and which doesn't. You see that's all we can do\"\r\n\r\n**Paul McCartney:** \"I don't wanna say it, 'cause I really just hear myself as being the only one saying it, always. And like, the three of you just sort of sit there, like 'Oh, he's saying that one again, is he?' And I never get any support, or anything. So I just think, 'Oh, well. Fuck it'. And I know it's right, and you know it's right\"\r\n\r\n**George Harrison:** \"Yes, all right. I just don't know what to do about it\"\r\n\r\n**Paul McCartney:** \"But doesn't everyone agree that it's confused at the moment. So, all I'm trying to say is, we've only got 12 more days, so we've really got to do this methodically, this one\"\r\n\r\n**George Harrison:** \"I'll wait until you get all your bits and then work my part out, if you like. It's like a matter of working it out with you, while you're working your bit out. You know, have you got your bass bit?\"\r\n\r\n**Paul McCartney:** \"You're doing it again as though I'm trying to say that. And what we said the other day, you know, I'm not trying to get you. What I really am trying to just say, 'Look lads, the band, shall we try it like this, you know?'\"\r\n\r\n**George Harrison:** \"It's funny how it only occurs when the...\"\r\n\r\n**Paul McCartney:** \"It's like 'shall we play guitar all through Hey Jude? Well, I don't think we should'\"\r\n\r\n**George Harrison:** \"Okay, well, I don't mind. I'll play whatever you want me to play. Or I won't play at all if you don't want me to play. Now, whatever it is that will please you, I'll do it. But I don't think you really know what that one is\" [...]\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n#### Conversation 3: Continuation - Working Methods and Time Management\r\n\r\n**Paul McCartney:** \"Look, you know, the... [sighs] No, it's not like that. You see, that's it, it's like, we can't do this. We've really got to sort out this, 'cause we're – this is – we're like – this is the one, you know. Now we're rehearsing, and we're trying to like get it together for a TV show, so we really – like you said, we've only been through four numbers, you know\"\r\n\r\n**George Harrison:** \"Mm\"\r\n\r\n**John Lennon:** \"Well...\"\r\n\r\n**Paul McCartney:** \"So we've probably got to get some system to get through like twenty, or thirty, and no more, and have learnt them. And it's probably going to be like sculpture. So that we get all the chords. So we can all vamp and all. Then we can all play, like, every solo we need. But like... You know what I mean? It's got to sound as though it's improving\"\r\n\r\n**George Harrison:** [careful] \"Yeah, well, it actually – it sounded to me, that for me, it was a waste of me time playing, when we started it today. I mean, I just started remembering then what it could get into the other day, after playing for around an hour, an hour and a half. And suddenly, you know, I just don't find that my – that what I'm doing is starting to have something, you know. Have some structure to it. [pause] You know, that's the thing\"\r\n\r\n**Paul McCartney:** \"Yeah, I know, I know what you mean, you know. 'Cause it's like—\"\r\n\r\n**George Harrison:** \"You know, I mean—\"\r\n\r\n**Paul McCartney:** \"It's just that that way of doing it, you know, puts me off the way I'm trying to do it, and—\"\r\n\r\n**George Harrison:** [resigned] \"Well, that's – you know. That's all, then. I can only do me, in that one way, however I do it, you know\" [long pause]\r\n\r\n**Paul McCartney:** [resigned] \"Let's do another song\"\r\n\r\n**George Harrison:** [commiserating] \"No, come on, we just have to learn this—\"\r\n\r\n**Paul McCartney:** \"No, no, it's – let's just do something else\"\r\n\r\n**George Harrison:** \"Do you want to do... 'Maxwell's Silver Hammer'?\"\r\n\r\n**John Lennon:** [encouraging] \"Well, let's do this, 'cause then we – we're gonna come to this, or whatever it is. And the thing is just try and think what – the stage we've got to be in then\"\r\n\r\n**Paul McCartney:** \"You just have to know that. I think we've wasted a lot of time, I think. I think we do like waste, physically waste a heck of a lot of time, you know, when the four of us are together\"","src/content/research/get-back-dialogue-day-to-day/mccartney-website/day-3-overview.md","a7f89cb7917430e5",{html:5022,metadata:5023},"<h2 id=\"day-3-overview-january-6-1969\">Day 3 Overview (January 6, 1969)</h2>\n<p>Third day of “Get Back” sessions at Twickenham Studios following weekend break.

But I always hear myself annoying you, and I’m trying…”</p>\n<p><strong>George Harrison:</strong> “No, you’re not annoying me. You don’t annoy me anymore”</p>\n<p><strong>Paul McCartney:</strong> “But you see what I mean. We do this then… Then I don’t know” […]</p>\n<p><strong>Paul McCartney:</strong> “I’m scared of me being the boss. And I have been for a couple of years. I always feel as though I’m trying to put you down and stop you playing. But I’m not. I’m trying to stop us all playing, until we know what we’re playing”</p>\n<p><strong>George Harrison:</strong> “But you’ve got to play in order to find which fits and which doesn’t. You see that’s all we can do”</p>\n<p><strong>Paul McCartney:</strong> “I don’t wanna say it, ‘cause I really just hear myself as being the only one saying it, always. And like, the three of you just sort of sit there, like ‘Oh, he’s saying that one again, is he?’ And I never get any support, or anything. So I just think, ‘Oh, well. Fuck it’. And I know it’s right, and you know it’s right”</p>\n<p><strong>George Harrison:</strong> “Yes, all right. I just don’t know what to do about it”</p>\n<p><strong>Paul McCartney:</strong> “But doesn’t everyone agree that it’s confused at the moment. So, all I’m trying to say is, we’ve only got 12 more days, so we’ve really got to do this methodically, this one”</p>\n<p><strong>George Harrison:</strong> “I’ll wait until you get all your bits and then work my part out, if you like. It’s like a matter of working it out with you, while you’re working your bit out. You know, have you got your bass bit?”</p>\n<p><strong>Paul McCartney:</strong> “You’re doing it again as though I’m trying to say that. And what we said the other day, you know, I’m not trying to get you. What I really am trying to just say, ‘Look lads, the band, shall we try it like this, you know?’”</p>\n<p><strong>George Harrison:</strong> “It’s funny how it only occurs when the…”</p>\n<p><strong>Paul McCartney:</strong> “It’s like ‘shall we play guitar all through Hey Jude? Well, I don’t think we should’”</p>\n<p><strong>George Harrison:</strong> “Okay, well, I don’t mind. I’ll play whatever you want me to play. Or I won’t play at all if you don’t want me to play. Now, whatever it is that will please you, I’ll do it. But I don’t think you really know what that one is” […]</p>\n<hr>\n<h4 id=\"conversation-3-continuation---working-methods-and-time-management\">Conversation 3: Continuation - Working Methods and Time Management</h4>\n<p><strong>Paul McCartney:</strong> “Look, you know, the… [sighs] No, it’s not like that. You see, that’s it, it’s like, we can’t do this. We’ve really got to sort out this, ‘cause we’re – this is – we’re like – this is the one, you know. Now we’re rehearsing, and we’re trying to like get it together for a TV show, so we really – like you said, we’ve only been through four numbers, you know”</p>\n<p><strong>George Harrison:</strong> “Mm”</p>\n<p><strong>John Lennon:</strong> “Well…”</p>\n<p><strong>Paul McCartney:</strong> “So we’ve probably got to get some system to get through like twenty, or thirty, and no more, and have learnt them. And it’s probably going to be like sculpture. So that we get all the chords. So we can all vamp and all. Then we can all play, like, every solo we need. But like… You know what I mean? It’s got to sound as though it’s improving”</p>\n<p><strong>George Harrison:</strong> [careful] “Yeah, well, it actually – it sounded to me, that for me, it was a waste of me time playing, when we started it today. I mean, I just started remembering then what it could get into the other day, after playing for around an hour, an hour and a half. And suddenly, you know, I just don’t find that my – that what I’m doing is starting to have something, you know. Have some structure to it. [pause] You know, that’s the thing”</p>\n<p><strong>Paul McCartney:</strong> “Yeah, I know, I know what you mean, you know. ‘Cause it’s like—”</p>\n<p><strong>George Harrison:</strong> “You know, I mean—”</p>\n<p><strong>Paul McCartney:</strong> “It’s just that that way of doing it, you know, puts me off the way I’m trying to do it, and—”</p>\n<p><strong>George Harrison:</strong> [resigned] “Well, that’s – you know. That’s all, then. I can only do me, in that one way, however I do it, you know” [long pause]</p>\n<p><strong>Paul McCartney:</strong> [resigned] “Let’s do another song”</p>\n<p><strong>George Harrison:</strong> [commiserating] “No, come on, we just have to learn this—”</p>\n<p><strong>Paul McCartney:</strong> “No, no, it’s – let’s just do something else”</p>\n<p><strong>George Harrison:</strong> “Do you want to do… ‘Maxwell’s Silver Hammer’?”</p>\n<p><strong>John Lennon:</strong> [encouraging] “Well, let’s do this, ‘cause then we – we’re gonna come to this, or whatever it is. And the thing is just try and think what – the stage we’ve got to be in then”</p>\n<p><strong>Paul McCartney:</strong> “You just have to know that. I think we’ve wasted a lot of time, I think.

The Beatles returned to Twickenham the following day (January 8).\r\n\r\n### Overall Atmosphere\r\n\r\n**Tensions continue:**\r\n- Unresolved issues from previous day (January 6) continued to simmer\r\n- Paul and George engaged in lengthy discussions about group's direction\r\n- John and Ringo remained mostly silent observers\r\n- Strained atmosphere persisted throughout\r\n\r\n**Morning session:**\r\n- Extensive talking about band's problems\r\n- Paul and George most vocal\r\n- John and Ringo listening\r\n- Discussions about potential split\r\n\r\n**Despite tensions, significant musical developments:**\r\n- First recorded performances of \"Get Back,\" \"The Long And Winding Road,\" \"Golden Slumbers\"\r\n- Continued work on strong live performance candidates\r\n- Various jam sessions and impromptu covers\r\n\r\n### Main Songs Recorded\r\n\r\n#### The Long And Winding Road (Paul)\r\n\r\n**Background:**\r\n- Paul began writing September 1968\r\n- Reportedly recorded demo at time, gave to Alistair Taylor (Apple Corps general manager)\r\n- First briefly played segment on January 3 (second day of rehearsals)\r\n\r\n**This session:**\r\n- Morning, before other Beatles arrived\r\n- Paul sat at piano and played song\r\n- Ran through for nearly 5 minutes\r\n- Lyrics still incomplete: only first verse and \"Many times I've been alone / And many times I've cried\"\r\n\r\n**Next session:** Formally introduced to bandmates on January 8\r\n\r\n#### Golden Slumbers (Paul)\r\n\r\n**First performance:** This day (January 7)\r\n\r\n**Lyrics source:** Adapted from 17th-century poem by dramatist Thomas Dekker\r\n\r\n**Status:** Version already quite close to one later released on Abbey Road\r\n\r\n**Connection:** Linked to \"Carry That Weight\" (introduced previous day), mirroring how two tracks eventually paired on album\r\n\r\n**Next session:** January 9\r\n\r\n#### Get Back (Paul)\r\n\r\n**Paul's quote from press release:**\r\n\"We were sitting in the studio and we made it up out of thin air… we started to write words there and then… when we finished it, we recorded it at Apple Studios and made it into a song to roller-coast by\"\r\n\r\n**Creation process:**\r\n- Conceived this day in studio\r\n- Melody emerged organically from unstructured jam session\r\n- Gradually took shape as Paul improvised lyrics and chord progressions\r\n- Cameras rolling during development\r\n\r\n**Initial development:**\r\n- Paul ad libbed vocalizations and chord changes\r\n- George strummed open chords on electric guitar in solidarity\r\n- Song started developing in Paul's mind while being filmed\r\n- 3 more versions of embryonic \"Get Back\" worked out with George and Ringo\r\n\r\n**Second run-through:**\r\n- Paul: Bass and mumbled vocals\r\n- George: Electric guitar\r\n- Ringo: Singing with Paul on newly invented chorus \"Get back, get back, get back to where you once belonged\"\r\n- **Inspiration:** Jackie Lomax's recently released single \"Sour Milk Sea\" on Paul's mind\r\n- Lyrics beginning to form: \"a woman, but she was another man,\" \"it coming, but she gets it while she can\"\r\n\r\n**Further development:**\r\n- George moved to electric guitar with wah-wah pedal\r\n- Ringo on drums with standard rock beat\r\n- Paul acknowledged Jackie Lomax inspiration: exclaimed \"C'mon Jackie,\" attempted to imitate English vocalist during second chorus\r\n- \"She was another man\" and \"gets it while she can\" lyrics solidified\r\n\r\n**After John arrived:** Surprisingly, worked extensively on \"I've Got A Feeling\" and \"Maxwell's Silver Hammer\" instead despite high inspiration for new composition\r\n\r\n**Next session:** January 9\r\n\r\n#### I've Got A Feeling (Paul + John composite)\r\n\r\n**Previous work:** January 2, 3, and 6\r\n\r\n**This session:** 6 rehearsals\r\n- Focus on refining vocals and tightening arrangement\r\n\r\n**Paul's direction:**\r\n- \"We should start off by doing everything we're gonna do on the thing (concert)\"\r\n- \"Like, the 'oh yeahs' in it, you've gotta do 'em how you're gonna do it, because there's no use singing 'em quiet now and planning to do 'em loud on the night\"\r\n- Instructed Ringo to keep 4/4 drum pattern during ascending/descending triplet chords instead of switching to swing beat\r\n\r\n**Status:** Arrangement already solidified, emphasis on vocal refinement\r\n\r\n**Next session:** January 8\r\n\r\n#### Maxwell's Silver Hammer (Paul)\r\n\r\n**Previous work:** January 3\r\n\r\n**This session:** 18 run-throughs\r\n- Working on arrangement throughout\r\n\r\n**New element:** \r\n- At Paul's request, Mal Evans brought anvil and hammer\r\n- Mal joined some rehearsals attempting to strike anvil on correct beats\r\n- Portion of rehearsal with Mal struggling appears in \"Let It Be\" movie\r\n\r\n**Arrangement ideas developed:**\r\n- Whistle during certain segments (just before verses)\r\n- George worked out vocal harmony for choruses\r\n\r\n**Next session:** January 8\r\n\r\n#### One After 909 (Lennon-McCartney)\r\n\r\n**Previous work:** January 3 and 6\r\n\r\n**This session:** 4 performances\r\n- Further refining arrangement\r\n- Becoming \"the fun rocker that would eventually grace the Let It Be album\"\r\n- Paul and Ringo providing solid backing\r\n- George providing guitar passages filling gaps between lyrical phrases\r\n\r\n**Next session:** January 8\r\n\r\n#### Across The Universe (John)\r\n\r\n**Previous work:** Reintroduced to band on January 6\r\n\r\n**This session:** 12 performances\r\n\r\n**John's intentions:**\r\n- \"I think we can do it almost the same way, just better. Anyway, just even to do it because I think it's just a waste banishing it. I'd sooner stick it in here\"\r\n- Bemoans it's \"another slow one – I know we'll knock off a couple of fast ones. If I just wasn't so tired when I got in\"\r\n- George assures him it's alright to contribute slower songs\r\n\r\n**Lyric sheet incident:**\r\n- John wasn't sure of lyrics previous day, requested set from Apple office\r\n- \"What's the first line?\" he asked before sheet arrives\r\n- When received from Eric Brown, reviews lyrics\r\n- Questions own poetry: dumbfoundedly asks \"tumble blindly??\"\r\n\r\n**Discussion of earlier recording:**\r\n- John dissatisfied with previous results\r\n- \"When we were doing it last time, we did it alright in the end. The thing I don't like about the version we did, is we didn't dig it the time we did it. All that tamboura was great…Got your taboura, then?\"\r\n- George: \"I liked those girls singing as well, which you didn't like. The whole record is great, really. It's just another idea, another way of doing it\"\r\n- John: \"I haven't heard it in a long time\"\r\n\r\n**Rehearsals progression:**\r\n- Song becoming somewhat tighter\r\n- Attention waned after while, renditions started sounding lethargic\r\n- John plays electric guitar, performing intro himself on earlier run-throughs (as on original recording)\r\n- Sings all words perfectly thanks to lyric sheet\r\n- Paul: Bass and harmonizing throughout verses, singing in unison during \"nothing's gonna change my world\" chorus sections\r\n- **John's counter:** \"I wish it f*cking would\" on one version (possibly response to earlier disagreements)\r\n- George: Electric guitar using wah-wah pedal, sometimes playing intro instead of John\r\n- Ringo: Steady full drum pattern in verses, sometimes losing beat with time signature changes, stops at chorus beginning to highlight \"nothing's gonna change\" vocals, then focuses on toms for remainder of each chorus\r\n\r\n**Next session:** January 9\r\n\r\n#### Don't Let Me Down (John)\r\n\r\n**Previous work:** Extensive rehearsals on January 6\r\n\r\n**This session:** 12 versions\r\n- Continuing to refine arrangement\r\n\r\n**Next session:** January 8\r\n\r\n#### She Came In Through The Bathroom Window (Paul)\r\n\r\n**Previous work:** Introduced January 6\r\n\r\n**This session:** 4 versions\r\n- Group becoming increasingly familiar\r\n- Paul introduced one take: \"We know this one, don't we?\"\r\n- Rehearsals closely matched tempo of version recorded six months later for Abbey Road\r\n\r\n**Next session:** January 8\r\n\r\n#### Gimme Some Truth (John)\r\n\r\n**Context:** Song John would later record for \"Imagine\" album in 1971\r\n\r\n**This session:** Several versions led by John\r\n\r\n### Chronological Conversations\r\n\r\n#### Conversation 1: Morning Discussion - Venue Debate & Show Concept\r\n\r\n**Paul McCartney:** \"I mean, at the moment, we're just rehearsing the numbers for the show. None of us has had the idea of what the show is gonna be yet\"\r\n\r\n**Michael Lindsay-Hogg:** \"One of the things wrong about doing the show here is it's too easy. Denis said, 'Come on, let's do it at Twickenham' and I think that's wrong. If we are doing it in the backyard, I think that's too easy. And that's why, I think, if you all have decided to do a show, then it should be the best show. Because you are The Beatles, you aren't four jerks\"\r\n\r\n**Paul McCartney:** \"The only thing about that though is that we don't want to go away\"\r\n\r\n**Michael Lindsay-Hogg:** \"Think of the lights in the water. Torch-lit. 2,000 Arabs. I mean, visually, it is fantastic\"\r\n\r\n**Paul McCartney:** \"But we're not going away\"\r\n\r\n**Michael Lindsay-Hogg:** \"My trouble is… I usually get talked over a good idea. I will, every day, say Tripoli and every day I get closer to the left fist\"\r\n\r\n**George Harrison:** \"We could make it like requests\"\r\n\r\n**Paul McCartney:** \"We should do the show in a place we're not allowed to do it. You know, like, we should trespass, go in, set up and then get moved and that should be the show. I mean, if you put us in the Houses of Parliament, playing in the main gallery at the Houses of Parliament, and getting forcibly ejected, still trying to play numbers and the police lifting you...\"\r\n\r\n**Michael Lindsay-Hogg:** \"I think that's too much of an obstacle\"\r\n\r\n**Paul McCartney:** (Singing) \"She came in through the bathroom window\"\r\n\r\n**Paul McCartney:** \"Scuffling with the coppers, boots and truncheons and all that. You have to take a bit of violence\"\r\n\r\n**Michael Lindsay-Hogg:** \"I think that's too dangerous… That is an interesting thought of you all being beaten up. You could go to Manila again\"\r\n\r\n**[George]:** \"Manila or Memphis\"\r\n\r\n**Michael Lindsay-Hogg:** \"What about a hospital? But I don't mean for really sick kids. I mean for kids with broken legs. I mean, really, kind of, 1944 Hollywood musical Bing Crosby kids\"\r\n\r\n**Paul McCartney:** \"Or in a hospital, they can't all get up and walk. [laughs] Except for the finale\"\r\n\r\n**Michael Lindsay-Hogg:** \"Oh, yes!\"\r\n\r\n**Paul McCartney:** \"When John walks up to the little girl and says, 'Come here.' And she gets up and walks\"\r\n\r\n**Michael Lindsay-Hogg:** \"Or maybe an orphans' home? An orphans' home. Children are the hope of the future department. What about an orphanage? How does that grab you guys? It's like, 'Going once, going twice, going three times and that's it'\"\r\n\r\n**Paul McCartney:** \"No\"\r\n\r\n**Michael Lindsay-Hogg:** \"Orphanage… Orphanage going downhill\"\r\n\r\n**[John]:** \"I don't think that orphanages and police balls are gonna do it\"\r\n\r\n**Michael Lindsay-Hogg:** \"What's the biggest charity in the world? I don't mean in terms of polio, but what's the most charitable thing anybody could do?\"\r\n\r\n**George Harrison:** \"They say… Don't they say, 'Charity begins at home'?\" [all laugh]\r\n\r\n**Paul McCartney:** \"So we'll do it at George's house\" [all laugh]\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n#### Conversation 2: Purpose, Communication & Package Discussion\r\n\r\n**John Lennon:** \"I think we are just repeating all the dullness\"\r\n\r\n**Paul McCartney:** \"We gotta have some serious reason for doing this or else we won't. What's it for? Can't be for the money\"\r\n\r\n**John Lennon:** \"I've decided the whole point of it is communication. And to be on TV is communication. We've got a chance to smile at people, like 'All You Need Is Love.' So that's my incentive for doing it\"\r\n\r\n**Michael Lindsay-Hogg:** \"If this comes off, we've got a great entertainment package. We've got an album, a documentary never seen before, and a performance. It's a great package\"\r\n\r\n**John Lennon:** \"The worst that we have is a documentary of us making an LP, if we don't get into a show\"\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n#### Conversation 3: Paul's Frustration - Lack of Support & Living in Past\r\n\r\n**Paul McCartney:** \"But we haven't played together, you see. That's the fucking thing. But when we do come together to play, we all just sort of talk about the fucking past! We're like old age pensioners. 'Remember the days when we used to rock?' You know, but we're here now, and we can do it, you know? But, I mean, all I want to see is enthusiasm! See, the thing is also I get to a bit where I just sort of push all my ideas. You know, I mean, a lot will come out of it if we could get the enthusiasm. I mean, why are you here? I'm here 'cause I wanna do a show. But I really don't feel an awful lot of support\"\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n#### Conversation 4: George's Response - Doldrums & Repeating Patterns\r\n\r\n**George Harrison:** \"We keep coming up against that one and I keep saying, 'Yeah well, I'd like to do this, this and that.' And we end up doing something again that nobody really wants to do\"\r\n\r\n**Paul McCartney:** \"If this one turns into that, it should definitely be the last for all of us. Because there just isn't any point\"\r\n\r\n**Michael Lindsay-Hogg:** \"I think that'd be sad. I mean, as an audience. That'd be sad\"\r\n\r\n**Paul McCartney:** \"Course it is! It's stupid. It is just stupid. You see, the people who are being stupid are the four of us\"\r\n\r\n**George Harrison:** \"We need to be creative instead of being the doldrums, which it always is. The Beatles have been in doldrums for at least a year\"\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n#### Conversation 5: Paul on Brian Epstein's Death & Lack of Discipline\r\n\r\n**Paul McCartney:** \"Ever since Mr. Epstein passed away, it's never been the same. I mean, we've been very negative since Mr. Epstein passed away. And that's why all of us, in turn, have been sick of the group. It's discipline we lack. We've never had discipline. We had a sort of slight, symbolic discipline. Like Mr. Epstein. You know, and he sort of said, 'Get suits on,' and we did. You know, and so we were always fighting that discipline a bit. There really is no one there now to say, 'Do it.' Whereas there always used to be. Daddy's gone away now, and we're on our own at the holiday camp. I think we either go home or we do it\"\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n#### Conversation 6: Performance vs. Recording Group\r\n\r\n**Michael Lindsay-Hogg:** \"Do you still wanna perform in front of an audience, or do you just see yourselves as a recording group?\"\r\n\r\n**Paul McCartney:** \"I think we've got a bit shy, I think I've got a bit shy of certain things, you know. 'Cause you know how often, like, on albums we sometimes blow one of your songs [talking to John], 'cause we come in in the wrong mood. And you say, 'This is how it goes. I'll be back.' And we're all just, 'Oh, well you…'\"\r\n\r\n**Michael Lindsay-Hogg:** \"That's why we're wrong to throw away the show. Because there's no desire\"\r\n\r\n**Paul McCartney:** \"So it's like, if we're doing the show, we're gonna have to work hard. And that means by the time a week from now comes all these songs we've got, we've gotta know perfectly\"\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n#### Conversation 7: George's Frustration with His Songs\r\n\r\n**George Harrison:** \"I don't wanna do any of my songs on the show. Because they just turn out shitty…\"\r\n\r\n**Paul McCartney:** \"No, but this… Thinking it's not gonna come out great won't help. If we cancel the show now, we'll be throwing it away\"\r\n\r\n**Michael Lindsay-Hogg:** \"But equally, at the moment we haven't got a show and so none of us really want to do it\"\r\n\r\n**Paul McCartney:** \"I'll do it. I'm not interested, you know, to spend my fucking days farting around here, while everyone makes up their minds whether they want to do it or not. It's like Mal said last night, 'If you're gonna do the show here, you've gotta decide today.' And as far as I can see, there's only two ways. We're gonna do it, or we're not gonna do it. And I want a decision!\"\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n#### Conversation 8: \"Maybe We Should Have a Divorce\"\r\n\r\n**George Harrison:** \"Maybe we should have a divorce\"\r\n\r\n**Paul McCartney:** \"Well, I said that at the last meeting. But it's getting nearer, you know?\"\r\n\r\n**John Lennon:** \"Who'd have the children?\"\r\n\r\n**Paul McCartney:** \"Dick James\"\r\n\r\n**John Lennon:** \"Oh, yeah\"","src/content/research/get-back-dialogue-day-to-day/mccartney-website/day-4-overview.md","1cc9132931790f08",{html:5076,metadata:5077},"<h2 id=\"day-4-overview-january-7-1969\">Day 4 Overview (January 7, 1969)</h2>\n<p>Fourth day of “Get Back” sessions at Twickenham Studios.

manager)</li>\n<li>First briefly played segment on January 3 (second day of rehearsals)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>This session:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Morning, before other Beatles arrived</li>\n<li>Paul sat at piano and played song</li>\n<li>Ran through for nearly 5 minutes</li>\n<li>Lyrics still incomplete: only first verse and “Many times I’ve been alone / And many times I’ve cried”</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Next session:</strong> Formally introduced to bandmates on January 8</p>\n<h4 id=\"golden-slumbers-paul\">Golden Slumbers (Paul)</h4>\n<p><strong>First performance:</strong> This day (January 7)</p>\n<p><strong>Lyrics source:</strong> Adapted from 17th-century poem by dramatist Thomas Dekker</p>\n<p><strong>Status:</strong> Version already quite close to one later released on Abbey Road</p>\n<p><strong>Connection:</strong> Linked to “Carry That Weight” (introduced previous day), mirroring how two tracks eventually paired on album</p>\n<p><strong>Next session:</strong> January 9</p>\n<h4 id=\"get-back-paul\">Get Back (Paul)</h4>\n<p><strong>Paul’s quote from press release:</strong>\r\n“We were sitting in the studio and we made it up out of thin air… we started to write words there and then… when we finished it, we recorded it at Apple Studios and made it into a song to roller-coast by”</p>\n<p><strong>Creation process:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Conceived this day in studio</li>\n<li>Melody emerged organically from unstructured jam session</li>\n<li>Gradually took shape as Paul improvised lyrics and chord progressions</li>\n<li>Cameras rolling during development</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Initial development:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Paul ad libbed vocalizations and chord changes</li>\n<li>George strummed

form: “a woman, but she was another man,” “it coming, but she gets it while she can”</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Further development:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>George moved to electric guitar with wah-wah pedal</li>\n<li>Ringo on drums with standard rock beat</li>\n<li>Paul acknowledged Jackie Lomax inspiration: exclaimed “C’mon Jackie,” attempted to imitate English vocalist during second chorus</li>\n<li>“She was another man” and “gets it while she can” lyrics solidified</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>After John arrived:</strong> Surprisingly, worked extensively on “I’ve Got A Feeling” and “Maxwell’s Silver Hammer” instead despite high inspiration for new composition</p>\n<p><strong>Next session:</strong> January 9</p>\n<h4 id=\"ive-got-a-feeling-paul--john-composite\">I’ve Got A Feeling (Paul + John composite)</h4>\n<p><strong>Previous work:</strong> January 2, 3, and 6</p>\n<p><strong>This session:</strong> 6 rehearsals</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Focus on refining vocals and tightening arrangement</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Paul’s direction:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>“We should start off by doing everything we’re gonna do on the thing (concert)”</li>\n<li>“Like, the ‘oh yeahs’ in it, you’ve gotta do ‘em how you’re gonna do it, because there’s no use singing ‘em quiet now and planning to do ‘em loud on the night”</li>\n<li>Instructed Ringo to keep 4/4 drum pattern during ascending/descending triplet chords instead of switching to swing beat</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Status:</strong> Arrangement already solidified, emphasis on vocal refinement</p>\n<p><strong>Next session:</strong> January 8</p>\n<h4 id=\"maxwells-silver-hammer-paul\">Maxwell’s Silver Hammer (Paul)</h4>\n<p><strong>Previous work:</strong> January 3</p>\n<p><strong>This session:</strong> 18

some rehearsals attempting to strike anvil on correct beats</li>\n<li>Portion of rehearsal with Mal struggling appears in “Let It Be” movie</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Arrangement ideas developed:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Whistle during certain segments (just before verses)</li>\n<li>George worked out vocal harmony for choruses</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Next session:</strong> January

backing</li>\n<li>George providing guitar passages filling gaps between lyrical phrases</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Next session:</strong> January 8</p>\n<h4 id=\"across-the-universe-john\">Across The Universe (John)</h4>\n<p><strong>Previous work:</strong> Reintroduced to band on January 6</p>\n<p><strong>This session:</strong> 12 performances</p>\n<p><strong>John’s intentions:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>“I think we can do it almost the same way, just better. Anyway, just even to do it because I think it’s just a waste banishing it. I’d sooner stick it in here”</li>\n<li>Bemoans it’s “another slow one – I know we’ll knock off a couple of fast ones. If I just wasn’t so tired when I got in”</li>\n<li>George assures him it’s alright to contribute slower songs</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Lyric sheet incident:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>John wasn’t sure of lyrics previous day, requested set from Apple office</li>\n<li>“What’s the first line?” he asked before sheet arrives</li>\n<li>When received from Eric Brown, reviews lyrics</li>\n<li>Questions own poetry: dumbfoundedly asks “tumble blindly??”</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Discussion of earlier recording:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>John dissatisfied with previous results</li>\n<li>“When we were doing it last time, we did it alright in the end. The thing I don’t like about the version we did, is we didn’t dig it the time we did it. All that tamboura was great…Got your taboura, then?”</li>\n<li>George: “I liked those girls singing as well, which you didn’t like. The whole record is great, really. It’s just another idea, another way of doing it”</li>\n<li>John: “I haven’t heard it in a long time”</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Rehearsals progression:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Song becoming somewhat tighter</li>\n<li>Attention waned after while, renditions started sounding lethargic</li>\n<li>John plays electric guitar, performing intro himself on earlier run-throughs (as on original recording)</li>\n<li>Sings all words perfectly thanks to lyric sheet</li>\n<li>Paul: Bass and harmonizing throughout verses, singing in unison during “nothing’s gonna change my world” chorus sections</li>\n<li><strong>John’s counter:</strong> “I wish it f*cking would” on one version (possibly response to earlier disagreements)</li>\n<li>George: Electric guitar using wah-wah pedal, sometimes playing intro instead of John</li>\n<li>Ringo: Steady full drum pattern in verses, sometimes losing beat with time signature changes, stops at chorus beginning to highlight “nothing’s gonna change” vocals, then focuses on toms for remainder of each chorus</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Next session:</strong> January 9</p>\n<h4 id=\"dont-let-me-down-john\">Don’t Let Me Down (John)</h4>\n<p><strong>Previous work:</strong> Extensive rehearsals on January 6</p>\n<p><strong>This session:</strong> 12 versions</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Continuing to refine arrangement</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Next session:</strong> January 8</p>\n<h4 id=\"she-came-in-through-the-bathroom-window-paul\">She Came In Through The Bathroom Window (Paul)</h4>\n<p><strong>Previous work:</strong> Introduced January 6</p>\n<p><strong>This session:</strong> 4 versions</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Group becoming increasingly familiar</li>\n<li>Paul introduced one take: “We know this one, don’t we?”</li>\n<li>Rehearsals closely matched tempo of version recorded six months later for Abbey Road</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Next session:</strong> January 8</p>\n<h4 id=\"gimme-some-truth-john\">Gimme Some Truth (John)</h4>\n<p><strong>Context:</strong> Song John would later record for “Imagine” album in 1971</p>\n<p><strong>This session:</strong> Several versions led by John</p>\n<h3 id=\"chronological-conversations\">Chronological Conversations</h3>\n<h4 id=\"conversation-1-morning-discussion---venue-debate--show-concept\">Conversation 1: Morning Discussion - Venue Debate &#x26; Show Concept</h4>\n<p><strong>Paul McCartney:</strong> “I mean, at the moment, we’re just rehearsing the numbers for the show. None of us has had the idea of what the show is gonna be yet”</p>\n<p><strong>Michael Lindsay-Hogg:</strong> “One of the things wrong about doing the show here is it’s too easy. Denis said, ‘Come on, let’s do it at Twickenham’ and I think that’s wrong. If we are doing it in the backyard, I think that’s too easy. And that’s why, I think, if you all have decided to do a show, then it should be the best show. Because you are The Beatles, you aren’t four jerks”</p>\n<p><strong>Paul McCartney:</strong> “The only thing about that though is that we don’t want to go away”</p>\n<p><strong>Michael Lindsay-Hogg:</strong> “Think of the lights in the water. Torch-lit. 2,000 Arabs. I mean, visually, it is fantastic”</p>\n<p><strong>Paul McCartney:</strong> “But we’re not going away”</p>\n<p><strong>Michael Lindsay-Hogg:</strong> “My trouble is… I usually get talked over a good idea. I will, every day, say Tripoli and every day I get closer to the left fist”</p>\n<p><strong>George Harrison:</strong> “We could make it like requests”</p>\n<p><strong>Paul McCartney:</strong> “We should do the show in a place we’re not allowed to do it. You know, like, we should trespass, go in, set up and then get moved and that should be the show. I mean, if you put us in the Houses of Parliament, playing in the main gallery at the Houses of Parliament, and getting forcibly ejected, still trying to play numbers and the police lifting you…”</p>\n<p><strong>Michael Lindsay-Hogg:</strong> “I think that’s too much of an obstacle”</p>\n<p><strong>Paul McCartney:</strong> (Singing) “She came in through the bathroom window”</p>\n<p><strong>Paul McCartney:</strong> “Scuffling with the coppers, boots and truncheons and all that. You have to take a bit of violence”</p>\n<p><strong>Michael Lindsay-Hogg:</strong> “I think that’s too dangerous… That is an interesting thought of you all being beaten up. You could go to Manila again”</p>\n<p><strong>[George]:</strong> “Manila or Memphis”</p>\n<p><strong>Michael Lindsay-Hogg:</strong> “What about a hospital? But I don’t mean for really sick kids. I mean for kids with broken legs. I mean, really, kind of, 1944 Hollywood musical Bing Crosby kids”</p>\n<p><strong>Paul McCartney:</strong> “Or in a hospital, they can’t all get up and walk. [laughs] Except for the finale”</p>\n<p><strong>Michael Lindsay-Hogg:</strong> “Oh, yes!”</p>\n<p><strong>Paul McCartney:</strong> “When John walks up to the little girl and says, ‘Come here.’ And she gets up and walks”</p>\n<p><strong>Michael Lindsay-Hogg:</strong> “Or maybe an orphans’ home? An orphans’ home. Children are the hope of the future department. What about an orphanage? How does that grab you guys? It’s like, ‘Going once, going twice, going three times and that’s it’”</p>\n<p><strong>Paul McCartney:</strong> “No”</p>\n<p><strong>Michael Lindsay-Hogg:</strong> “Orphanage… Orphanage going downhill”</p>\n<p><strong>[John]:</strong> “I don’t think that orphanages and police balls are gonna do it”</p>\n<p><strong>Michael Lindsay-Hogg:</strong> “What’s the biggest charity in the world? I don’t mean in terms of polio, but what’s the most charitable thing anybody could do?”</p>\n<p><strong>George Harrison:</strong> “They say… Don’t they say, ‘Charity begins at home’?” [all laugh]</p>\n<p><strong>Paul McCartney:</strong> “So we’ll do it at George’s house” [all laugh]</p>\n<hr>\n<h4 id=\"conversation-2-purpose-communication--package-discussion\">Conversation 2: Purpose, Communication &#x26; Package Discussion</h4>\n<p><strong>John Lennon:</strong> “I think we are just repeating all the dullness”</p>\n<p><strong>Paul McCartney:</strong> “We gotta have some serious reason for doing this or else we won’t. What’s it for? Can’t be for the money”</p>\n<p><strong>John Lennon:</strong> “I’ve decided the whole point of it is communication. And to be on TV is communication. We’ve got a chance to smile at people, like ‘All You Need Is Love.’ So that’s my incentive for doing it”</p>\n<p><strong>Michael Lindsay-Hogg:</strong> “If this comes off, we’ve got a great entertainment package. We’ve got an album, a documentary never seen before, and a performance. It’s a great package”</p>\n<p><strong>John Lennon:</strong> “The worst that we have is a documentary of us making an LP, if we don’t get into a show”</p>\n<hr>\n<h4 id=\"conversation-3-pauls-frustration---lack-of-support--living-in-past\">Conversation 3: Paul’s Frustration - Lack of Support &#x26; Living in Past</h4>\n<p><strong>Paul McCartney:</strong> “But we haven’t played together, you see. That’s the fucking thing. But when we do come together to play, we all just sort of talk about the fucking past! We’re like old age pensioners. ‘Remember the days when we used to rock?’ You know, but we’re here now, and we can do it, you know? But, I mean, all I want to see is enthusiasm! See, the thing is also I get to a bit where I just sort of push all my ideas. You know, I mean, a lot will come out of it if we could get the enthusiasm. I mean, why are you here? I’m here ‘cause I wanna do a show. But I really don’t feel an awful lot of support”</p>\n<hr>\n<h4 id=\"conversation-4-georges-response---doldrums--repeating-patterns\">Conversation 4: George’s Response - Doldrums &#x26; Repeating Patterns</h4>\n<p><strong>George Harrison:</strong> “We keep coming up against that one and I keep saying, ‘Yeah well, I’d like to do this, this and that.’ And we end up doing something again that nobody really wants to do”</p>\n<p><strong>Paul McCartney:</strong> “If this one turns into that, it should definitely be the last for all of us. Because there just isn’t any point”</p>\n<p><strong>Michael Lindsay-Hogg:</strong> “I think that’d be sad. I mean, as an audience. That’d be sad”</p>\n<p><strong>Paul McCartney:</strong> “Course it is! It’s stupid. It is just stupid. You see, the people who are being stupid are the four of us”</p>\n<p><strong>George Harrison:</strong> “We need to be creative instead of being the doldrums, which it always is.

I mean, we’ve been very negative since Mr. Epstein passed away. And that’s why all of us, in turn, have been sick of the group. It’s discipline we lack. We’ve never had discipline. We had a sort of slight, symbolic discipline. Like Mr. Epstein. You know, and he sort of said, ‘Get suits on,’ and we did. You know, and so we were always fighting that discipline a bit. There really is no one there now to say, ‘Do it.’ Whereas there always used to be. Daddy’s gone away now, and we’re on our own at the holiday camp. I think we either go home or we do it”</p>\n<hr>\n<h4 id=\"conversation-6-performance-vs-recording-group\">Conversation 6: Performance vs. Recording Group</h4>\n<p><strong>Michael Lindsay-Hogg:</strong> “Do you still wanna perform in front of an audience, or do you just see yourselves as a recording group?”</p>\n<p><strong>Paul McCartney:</strong> “I think we’ve got a bit shy, I think I’ve got a bit shy of certain things, you know. ‘Cause you know how often, like, on albums we sometimes blow one of your songs [talking to John], ‘cause we come in in the wrong mood. And you say, ‘This is how it goes. I’ll be back.’ And we’re all just, ‘Oh, well you…’”</p>\n<p><strong>Michael Lindsay-Hogg:</strong> “That’s why we’re wrong to throw away the show. Because there’s no desire”</p>\n<p><strong>Paul McCartney:</strong> “So it’s like, if we’re doing the show, we’re gonna have to work hard. And that means by the time a week from now comes all these songs we’ve got, we’ve gotta know perfectly”</p>\n<hr>\n<h4 id=\"conversation-7-georges-frustration-with-his-songs\">Conversation 7: George’s Frustration with His Songs</h4>\n<p><strong>George Harrison:</strong> “I don’t wanna do any of my songs on the show.

If we cancel the show now, we’ll be throwing it away”</p>\n<p><strong>Michael Lindsay-Hogg:</strong> “But equally, at the moment we haven’t got a show and so none of us really want to do it”</p>\n<p><strong>Paul McCartney:</strong> “I’ll do it. I’m not interested, you know, to spend my fucking days farting around here, while everyone makes up their minds whether they want to do it or not. It’s like Mal said last night, ‘If you’re gonna do the show here, you’ve gotta decide today.’ And as far as I can see, there’s only two ways. We’re gonna do it, or we’re not gonna do it.

bastard\" (repeated)\r\n- Another verse with new chord pattern and melody line premiered\r\n- Additional verse (lyrically doesn't make much sense, includes odd time signature changes as was John's

(sarcastic) \"Yeah, I was hoping for the same thing myself\"\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n#### Conversation 2: End of Day - Libya/Boat Trip Discussion (Extensive)\r\n\r\n**Paul McCartney:** \"An outdoor scene has to be in England because…\"\r\n\r\n**Denis O'Dell:** \"I don't think it's practical to do it in England. It's too bloody cold\"\r\n\r\n**Michael Lindsay-Hogg:** \"Yes, that was one of the reasons we started veering off on these ideas was when we were looking at locations that Friday after Christmas\"\r\n\r\n**Paul McCartney:** \"We are in a film studio. We're going to build something so that… We shouldn't just try and build something like the Tower Ballroom, 'cause we could go to the Tower Ballroom\"\r\n\r\n**Michael Lindsay-Hogg:** \"But, once you get on a stage, you are performers and you gotta have someone to do it to. Either the camera or real people, I think\"\r\n\r\n**Paul McCartney:** \"Yeah, we haven't… Any number we've done at the moment, if we've noticed the camera on us, we've tried to ignore it\"\r\n\r\n**Michael Lindsay-Hogg:** \"But you've either got to be performing directly to the people at home or to an audience\"\r\n\r\n**Paul McCartney:** \"See that's why I thought like a ballroom. If we did go right back. Like, 'Come to the Tower Ballroom. There's a dance on.' You know? Oh, incidentally, we'll be the band there. And then we go on and we play all the numbers\"\r\n\r\n**Michael Lindsay-Hogg:** \"But you're just not the local dance band. I don't think it's quite enough scope\"\r\n\r\n**Glyn Johns:** \"I also think that people are very interested in seeing how an audience would react\"\r\n\r\n**Michael Lindsay-Hogg:** \"Because the audience is so much part of the first half of you, musically\"\r\n\r\n**Paul McCartney:** \"Okay, so we're all prepared to do it with an audience. But you can't just have the same old audience\"\r\n\r\n**Denis O'Dell:** \"What can you do that's new with them?\"\r\n\r\n**George Harrison:** \"If we can just think of an image, how we'd like to be, which could be like a nightclub act. Just the smoochy low lights and about ten people\"\r\n\r\n**Michael Lindsay-Hogg:** \"What's the point, when you could be giving people happiness with a full house? Whatever kind of full house we decided. I mean, we have to think about the audience. It really ought to be the whole world\"\r\n\r\n**Denis O'Dell:** \"That's where… Now we're going right… the whole circle back to Sabratha\"\r\n\r\n**Michael Lindsay-Hogg:** \"It is a location which is marvelous in itself, by the sea\"\r\n\r\n**Denis O'Dell:** \"What he's saying is right. It's the background\"\r\n\r\n**Michael Lindsay-Hogg:** \"I don't think anything is gonna beat a perfect acoustic place by the water, out of doors\"\r\n\r\n**Ringo Starr:** \"For a rock and roll group?\"\r\n\r\n**Denis O'Dell:** \"I really think we ought to go over and set it up upfront. Shoot a day sequence, a night sequence, a torchlight sequence out there with sea, desert, four days. Make it comfortable for everybody\"\r\n\r\n**Michael Lindsay-Hogg:** \"Yes, I think we're gonna do rock and roll at dawn or at night. I'm sure we can do rock and roll there if we get the right audience\"\r\n\r\n(chattering)\r\n\r\n**Michael Lindsay-Hogg:** (talking to John Lennon joining conversation) \"Come on. We're going to Africa. We're off\"\r\n\r\n**Paul McCartney:** \"No, we're not. Not necessarily\"\r\n\r\n**John Lennon:** \"Yeah! Let's go! Let's go!\"\r\n\r\n**George Harrison:** \"Where to?\"\r\n\r\n**Denis O'Dell:** \"To Sabratha… Tripoli! Fantastic sound!\"\r\n\r\n**Ringo Starr:** \"You're thinking of yourself, 'cause you wanna be nice and warm and cosy!\"\r\n\r\n**George Harrison:** \"What is the point of doing it abroad? I'd much rather do it, and then go away\"\r\n\r\n**John Lennon:** \"See, it's like having the most fantastic set on Earth, but we haven't made a set, you know?\"\r\n\r\n**Ringo Starr:** \"How many are gonna be looking at the set besides us and him?\"\r\n\r\n**John Lennon:** \"Every time we've done an album, we've said, 'Why are we stuck in EMI?' We could be doing it in LA. We could be in France. And every time we do it, and here we are again, building another bloody castle around us\"\r\n\r\n**Paul McCartney:** \"Well said, John. Well said!\"\r\n\r\n**John Lennon:** \"And this time we do it there. I'd be thrilled to do it. Just timing it so as the sun came up just on the middle eight\"\r\n\r\n**Michael Lindsay-Hogg:** \"One of Russia's points was that he wanted an English audience\"\r\n\r\n**John Lennon:** \"Oh Russia? That's be great!\"\r\n\r\n**Michael Trommsdorff:** \"No, no, no that's Ringo's code name. He's Russia\"\r\n\r\n**John Lennon:** \"Just give me one reason to stay there?\"\r\n\r\n**Ringo Starr:** \"For the people!\"\r\n\r\n**John Lennon:** \"People? That's the only reason. Alright, so we'll take 'em with us\"\r\n\r\n**Paul McCartney:** \"Look, we were gonna give tickets away at this door here. We'd given out those tickets, but they include a boat ride as well\"\r\n\r\n**Michael Lindsay-Hogg:** \"We take them with us, and that's the show\"\r\n\r\n**Paul McCartney:** \"Okay, yeah. We're doing a live show. And we're doing it in Arabia. And it's like… Whoever has been waiting to see the lads rocking again\"\r\n\r\n**George Harrison:** \"It's just impractical to try and get all those… Lug all them people there and try and get all that equipment\"\r\n\r\n**Paul McCartney:** \"But then if it was their problem…\"\r\n\r\n**Denis O'Dell:** \"But if you say, 'That's what I want,' that's what has to happen\"\r\n\r\n**John Lennon:** \"That's not our problem\"\r\n\r\n**George Harrison:** \"Of course it's our problem\"\r\n\r\n**Paul McCartney:** \"Tell you what I'll offer you. If we're going away and we hire a boat to take the audience with you. We'll do a bloody show on a boat\"\r\n\r\n**Michael Lindsay-Hogg:** \"Wait here's France coming in here now\"\r\n\r\n**George Harrison:** \"France? I can't go to France!\"\r\n\r\n**Michael Lindsay-Hogg:** \"No no, no. That's your code name\"\r\n\r\n**Paul McCartney:** \"No, he smoked some garlic once\" (laughing)\r\n\r\n**Paul McCartney:** \"So, like, I'll come in with you, as long as you can get a couple of boats\"\r\n\r\n**George Harrison:** \"And then we're stuck with a bloody big boatload of people for two weeks. At least you can go home from here. You can get away from it all\"\r\n\r\n**Denis O'Dell:** \"It'll take three days trip on the boat\"\r\n\r\n**George Harrison:** \"I think the idea of the boat is completely insane. It's very expensive and insane, and…\"\r\n\r\n**Denis O'Dell:** \"I think it should be the least of our worries. Money. I really do\"\r\n\r\n**George Harrison:** \"And who's gonna cough up for that though?\"\r\n\r\n**John Lennon:** \"If P&O will do a deal with Storm, they'll do one with us\"\r\n\r\n**George Harrison:** \"They haven't even made back the money it cost to buy the film for Magical Mystery Tour\"\r\n\r\n**John Lennon:** \"We should be able to get the boat for the publicity they get from it\"\r\n\r\n**George Harrison:** \"They won't even give us a free Fender amp!\"\r\n\r\n**Ringo Starr:** \"I've stopped being Russia now\"\r\n\r\n**Denis O'Dell:** \"It's gonna be great. You'd love the place\"\r\n\r\n**Ringo Starr:** \"I've moved to Yugoslavia!\" [chuckles]\r\n\r\n**George Harrison:** \"I may love the place, but I'd rather do the show, then go and love the place\"\r\n\r\n**Ringo Starr:** \"How're you gonna get a ship in a couple of days?\"\r\n\r\n**John Lennon:** \"We got the American Navy for 'How I Won The War'\"\r\n\r\n**Ringo Starr:** \"I was there. Yes, I know. But they were passing by and you only used them for a few hours. I've seen it, John. I went to the premiere\"\r\n\r\n**John Lennon:** \"Did you enjoy it?\"\r\n\r\n**Ringo Starr:** \"I thought you were great\"\r\n\r\n**John Lennon:** \"Thanks a lot, Ringo\" (laughing)\r\n\r\n**Michael Lindsay-Hogg:** \"How are we stacking? If there's no problem with the equipment, and with the right audience, which will be basically English-speaking brought from here\"\r\n\r\n**John Lennon:** \"Broad-minded Englishmen wanted!\"\r\n\r\n**Ringo Starr:** \"Still not the same\"\r\n\r\n**Michael Lindsay-Hogg:** \"If you'll say yes, and if we get it together, then will you go?\"\r\n\r\n**John Lennon:** \"Well, if we mull it over tonight.

It’s too bloody cold”</p>\n<p><strong>Michael Lindsay-Hogg:</strong> “Yes, that was one of the reasons we started veering off on these ideas was when we were looking at locations that Friday after Christmas”</p>\n<p><strong>Paul McCartney:</strong> “We are in a film studio. We’re going to build something so that… We shouldn’t just try and build something like the Tower Ballroom, ‘cause we could go to the Tower Ballroom”</p>\n<p><strong>Michael Lindsay-Hogg:</strong> “But, once you get on a stage, you are performers and you gotta have someone to do it to. Either the camera or real people, I think”</p>\n<p><strong>Paul McCartney:</strong> “Yeah, we haven’t… Any number we’ve done at the moment, if we’ve noticed the camera on us, we’ve tried to ignore it”</p>\n<p><strong>Michael Lindsay-Hogg:</strong> “But you’ve either got to be performing directly to the people at home or to an audience”</p>\n<p><strong>Paul McCartney:</strong> “See that’s why I thought like a ballroom. If we did go right back. Like, ‘Come to the Tower Ballroom. There’s a dance on.’ You know? Oh, incidentally, we’ll be the band there. And then we go on and we play all the numbers”</p>\n<p><strong>Michael Lindsay-Hogg:</strong> “But you’re just not the local dance band. I don’t think it’s quite enough scope”</p>\n<p><strong>Glyn Johns:</strong> “I also think that people are very interested in seeing how an audience would react”</p>\n<p><strong>Michael Lindsay-Hogg:</strong> “Because the audience is so much part of the first half of you, musically”</p>\n<p><strong>Paul McCartney:</strong> “Okay, so we’re all prepared to do it with an audience. But you can’t just have the same old audience”</p>\n<p><strong>Denis O’Dell:</strong> “What can you do that’s new with them?”</p>\n<p><strong>George Harrison:</strong> “If we can just think of an image, how we’d like to be, which could be like a nightclub act. Just the smoochy low lights and about ten people”</p>\n<p><strong>Michael Lindsay-Hogg:</strong> “What’s the point, when you could be giving people happiness with a full house? Whatever kind of full house we decided. I mean, we have to think about the audience. It really ought to be the whole world”</p>\n<p><strong>Denis O’Dell:</strong> “That’s where… Now we’re going right… the whole circle back to Sabratha”</p>\n<p><strong>Michael Lindsay-Hogg:</strong> “It is a location which is marvelous in itself, by the sea”</p>\n<p><strong>Denis O’Dell:</strong> “What he’s saying is right. It’s the background”</p>\n<p><strong>Michael Lindsay-Hogg:</strong> “I don’t think anything is gonna beat a perfect acoustic place by the water, out of doors”</p>\n<p><strong>Ringo Starr:</strong> “For a rock and roll group?”</p>\n<p><strong>Denis O’Dell:</strong> “I really think we ought to go over and set it up upfront. Shoot a day sequence, a night sequence, a torchlight sequence out there with sea, desert, four days. Make it comfortable for everybody”</p>\n<p><strong>Michael Lindsay-Hogg:</strong> “Yes, I think we’re gonna do rock and roll at dawn or at night. I’m sure we can do rock and roll there if we get the right audience”</p>\n<p>(chattering)</p>\n<p><strong>Michael Lindsay-Hogg:</strong> (talking to John Lennon joining conversation) “Come on. We’re going to Africa. We’re off”</p>\n<p><strong>Paul McCartney:</strong> “No, we’re not. Not necessarily”</p>\n<p><strong>John Lennon:</strong> “Yeah! Let’s go! Let’s go!”</p>\n<p><strong>George Harrison:</strong> “Where to?”</p>\n<p><strong>Denis O’Dell:</strong> “To Sabratha… Tripoli! Fantastic sound!”</p>\n<p><strong>Ringo Starr:</strong> “You’re thinking of yourself, ‘cause you wanna be nice and warm and cosy!”</p>\n<p><strong>George Harrison:</strong> “What is the point of doing it abroad? I’d much rather do it, and then go away”</p>\n<p><strong>John Lennon:</strong> “See, it’s like having the most fantastic set on Earth, but we haven’t made a set, you know?”</p>\n<p><strong>Ringo Starr:</strong> “How many are gonna be looking at the set besides us and him?”</p>\n<p><strong>John Lennon:</strong> “Every time we’ve done an album, we’ve said, ‘Why are we stuck in EMI?’ We could be doing it in LA. We could be in France. And every time we do it, and here we are again, building another bloody castle around us”</p>\n<p><strong>Paul McCartney:</strong> “Well said, John. Well said!”</p>\n<p><strong>John Lennon:</strong> “And this time we do it there. I’d be thrilled to do it. Just timing it so as the sun came up just on the middle eight”</p>\n<p><strong>Michael Lindsay-Hogg:</strong> “One of Russia’s points was that he wanted an English audience”</p>\n<p><strong>John Lennon:</strong> “Oh Russia? That’s be great!”</p>\n<p><strong>Michael Trommsdorff:</strong> “No, no, no that’s Ringo’s code name. He’s Russia”</p>\n<p><strong>John Lennon:</strong> “Just give me one reason to stay there?”</p>\n<p><strong>Ringo Starr:</strong> “For the people!”</p>\n<p><strong>John Lennon:</strong> “People? That’s the only reason. Alright, so we’ll take ‘em with us”</p>\n<p><strong>Paul McCartney:</strong> “Look, we were gonna give tickets away at this door here. We’d given out those tickets, but they include a boat ride as well”</p>\n<p><strong>Michael Lindsay-Hogg:</strong> “We take them with us, and that’s the show”</p>\n<p><strong>Paul McCartney:</strong> “Okay, yeah. We’re doing a live show. And we’re doing it in Arabia. And it’s like… Whoever has been waiting to see the lads rocking again”</p>\n<p><strong>George Harrison:</strong> “It’s just impractical to try and get all those… Lug all them people there and try and get all that equipment”</p>\n<p><strong>Paul McCartney:</strong> “But then if it was their problem…”</p>\n<p><strong>Denis O’Dell:</strong> “But if you say, ‘That’s what I want,’ that’s what has to happen”</p>\n<p><strong>John Lennon:</strong> “That’s not our problem”</p>\n<p><strong>George Harrison:</strong> “Of course it’s our problem”</p>\n<p><strong>Paul McCartney:</strong> “Tell you what I’ll offer you. If we’re going away and we hire a boat to take the audience with you. We’ll do a bloody show on a boat”</p>\n<p><strong>Michael Lindsay-Hogg:</strong> “Wait here’s France coming in here now”</p>\n<p><strong>George Harrison:</strong> “France? I can’t go to France!”</p>\n<p><strong>Michael Lindsay-Hogg:</strong> “No no, no. That’s your code name”</p>\n<p><strong>Paul McCartney:</strong> “No, he smoked some garlic once” (laughing)</p>\n<p><strong>Paul McCartney:</strong> “So, like, I’ll come in with you, as long as you can get a couple of boats”</p>\n<p><strong>George Harrison:</strong> “And then we’re stuck with a bloody big boatload of people for two weeks. At least you can go home from here. You can get away from it all”</p>\n<p><strong>Denis O’Dell:</strong> “It’ll take three days trip on the boat”</p>\n<p><strong>George Harrison:</strong> “I think the idea of the boat is completely insane. It’s very expensive and insane, and…”</p>\n<p><strong>Denis O’Dell:</strong> “I think it should be the least of our worries. Money. I really do”</p>\n<p><strong>George Harrison:</strong> “And who’s gonna cough up for that though?”</p>\n<p><strong>John Lennon:</strong> “If P&#x26;O will do a deal with Storm, they’ll do one with us”</p>\n<p><strong>George Harrison:</strong> “They haven’t even made back the money it cost to buy the film for Magical Mystery Tour”</p>\n<p><strong>John Lennon:</strong> “We should be able to get the boat for the publicity they get from it”</p>\n<p><strong>George Harrison:</strong> “They won’t even give us a free Fender amp!”</p>\n<p><strong>Ringo Starr:</strong> “I’ve stopped being Russia now”</p>\n<p><strong>Denis O’Dell:</strong> “It’s gonna be great. You’d love the place”</p>\n<p><strong>Ringo Starr:</strong> “I’ve moved to Yugoslavia!” [chuckles]</p>\n<p><strong>George Harrison:</strong> “I may love the place, but I’d rather do the show, then go and love the place”</p>\n<p><strong>Ringo Starr:</strong> “How’re you gonna get a ship in a couple of days?”</p>\n<p><strong>John Lennon:</strong> “We got the American Navy for ‘How I Won The War’”</p>\n<p><strong>Ringo Starr:</strong> “I was there. Yes, I know. But they were passing by and you only used them for a few hours. I’ve seen it, John. I went to the premiere”</p>\n<p><strong>John Lennon:</strong> “Did you enjoy it?”</p>\n<p><strong>Ringo Starr:</strong> “I thought you were great”</p>\n<p><strong>John Lennon:</strong> “Thanks a lot, Ringo” (laughing)</p>\n<p><strong>Michael Lindsay-Hogg:</strong> “How are we stacking?

As soon as we've got it, then we should get the tapes and do a rough demo when it's the first rehearsal. It'd be great for Aretha Franklin, that number\"\r\n\r\n**Paul's elaboration (Let It Be Anniversary edition book):**\r\n\"What I used to like to do was think who would I really like to do this so, if we weren't jealously guarding a song for some reason, I would get an early version to people I would love to record it. I sent 'Let It Be' to Aretha Franklin\"\r\n\r\n**Result:** Her rendition included on \"This Girl's In Love With You\" album (released January 15, 1970, nearly two months prior to Beatles' released version)\r\n\r\n### Chronological Conversations\r\n\r\n#### Conversation 1: Libya/Boat Discussion Resurfaced - Ringo's Opposition\r\n\r\n**Context:** Previous day, Michael Lindsay-Hogg and Denis O'Dell attempted to persuade Beatles to perform abroad.

Did you think about it last night?\"\r\n\r\n**Paul McCartney:** (shaking head to say no)\r\n\r\n**Mal Evans:** \"It's gonna be an indoor… It's gonna be indoor… inside a building\"\r\n\r\n**Paul McCartney:** \"The airport and the Houses of Parliament aren't the right ones, but if, you know, we hit the right one…\"\r\n\r\n**Mal Evans:** \"I think it's down to if we're going to do it in this country, we might as well do it here\"\r\n\r\n**Paul McCartney:** \"But actually… We're going on a farm in Scotland\"\r\n\r\n**Mal Evans:** \"What?\"\r\n\r\n**Paul McCartney:** \"Kidding… Yugoslavia\"\r\n\r\n**Linda Eastman:** \"I'd love to find… a farm\"\r\n\r\n**Michael Lindsay-Hogg:** \"Yes, Paul was saying yesterday, a farm\"\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n#### Conversation 3: Show Format & Covers Discussion\r\n\r\n**George Harrison:** \"If we are in a groovy location place, we can make the show about different bits and pieces of what we've done. Or we have to do it in one consecutive piece\"\r\n\r\n**John Lennon:** \"I think we could do both, you see? We should do it about three times. We'd settle on one day when we say, 'This is the show.' But we'd do a, like, dress rehearsal\"\r\n\r\n**George Harrison:** \"Okay. Shall we do some other people's tunes as well?\"\r\n\r\n**Unknown:** \"That'd be nice\"\r\n\r\n**John Lennon:** \"I don't know any. I can only just bear doing your lot's songs\"\r\n\r\n**George Harrison:** \"Some other people's songs are much better than ours\"\r\n\r\n**John Lennon:** \"That's why I don't learn 'em\"","src/content/research/get-back-dialogue-day-to-day/mccartney-website/day-6-overview.md","2cfd268e760be255",{html:5194,metadata:5195},"<h2 id=\"day-6-overview-january-9-1969\">Day 6 Overview (January 9, 1969)</h2>\n<p>Sixth day of rehearsals at Twickenham Film Studios.

Or I won't play at all if you don't want me to play. Now, whatever it is that will please you, I'll do it\"\r\n- Echoed Ringo's temporary exit August 1968, but this time fractures more pronounced\r\n\r\n**Remaining three Beatles' response:**\r\n- Mix of denial or unwillingness to confront situation (especially with cameras rolling)\r\n- Carried on as if nothing had happened\r\n- Mix of defiance and catharsis\r\n\r\n**John's sarcastic reactions:**\r\n- Called out \"OK George, take it!\" as if expecting him to return\r\n- Yoko now seated on George's blue cushion, took center stage\r\n- Wailed wordless vocals over series of raw, blues-based jams\r\n\r\n**Band's frustration spilled into performances:**\r\n- \"I've Got a Feeling\" and \"Don't Let Me Down\" played with aggressive edge\r\n- John screamed through \"Don't Let Me Down\"\r\n- Offbeat moment: John sang \"Maxwell's Silver Hammer\" in exaggerated German accent\r\n\r\n**Paul returned to piano:**\r\n- Yoko continued vocal improvisations, seemingly oblivious to tension\r\n\r\n**John's conversation with Michael Lindsay-Hogg:**\r\n- Session tapes captured discussion suggesting if George didn't return within few days, Eric Clapton could take his place\r\n\r\n**Freeform jamming:**\r\n- Three Beatles engaged in more jams\r\n- Paul switched to drums\r\n- John on guitar\r\n- Ringo delivering improvised spoken-word lines\r\n\r\n**Session end:** After few hours of aimless musical outburst, session ended early\r\n\r\n### George Harrison's Accounts\r\n\r\n**From Beatles Anthology (2000):**\r\n\"They were filming us having a row. It never came to blows, but I thought, 'What's the point of this? I'm quite capable of being relatively happy on my own and I'm not able to be happy in this situation. I'm getting out of here.' Everybody had gone through that. Ringo had left at one point. I know John wanted out. It was a very, very difficult, stressful time, and being filmed having a row as well was terrible. I got up and I thought, 'I'm not doing this any more. I'm out of here.' So I got my guitar and went home and that afternoon wrote 'Wah-Wah'.\r\n\r\nIt became stifling, so that although this new album was supposed to break away from that type of recording (we were going back to playing live) it was still very much that kind of situation where he already had in his mind what he wanted. Paul wanted nobody to play on his songs until he decided how it should go. For me it was like: 'What am I doing here? This is painful!'\r\n\r\nThen superimposed on top of that was Yoko, and there were negative vibes at that time. John and Yoko were out on a limb. I don't think he wanted much to be hanging out with us, and I think Yoko was pushing him out of the band, inasmuch as she didn't want him hanging out with us.\r\n\r\nIt's important to state that a lot of water has gone under the bridge and that, as we talk now, everybody's good friends and we have a better understanding of the past. But talking about what was happening at that time, you can see it was strange\"\r\n\r\n**From Keith Badman 'Off the Record' (2008):**\r\n\"That period was the low of all time. In normal circumstances, I had not let his attitude bother me and, to get a peaceful life, I had always let him have his own way, even when this meant that songs, which I had composed, were not being recorded. In front of the cameras, as we were actually being filmed, Paul started to get at me about the way I was playing. Everybody had left at one time or another, but I left during Let It Be. When I left, there's a scene where Paul and I are having an argument and we're trying to cover it up. Then, the next scene, I'm not there and Yoko's just screaming, doing her screeching number. Well, that's where I had left, and I went home and wrote 'Wah Wah'. It'd given me a wah-wah, like I had such a headache with that whole argument. It was such a headache\"\r\n\r\n**George's diary entry for January 10:**\r\n\"January 10. Got up. Went to Twickenham. Rehearsed until lunchtime. Left The Beatles. Went home\"\r\n\r\n### Other Beatles' Perspectives\r\n\r\n**Ringo Starr (Keith Badman 'Off the Record' 2008):**\r\n\"George had to leave because he thought Paul was dominating him. Well, he was because Michael Lindsay-Hogg liked Paul, I would think, more than the rest of us. So, it's like Paul's film, actually\"\r\n\r\n**George Martin (Keith Badman 'Off the Record' 2008):**\r\n\"In order to get things together, Paul would organise everyone and be rather bossy, which the other boys didn't like. But, it was the only way of getting it together. John would drift away with Yoko and George would say he wouldn't be coming in the following day. It was general disenchantment\"\r\n\r\n### Michael Lindsay-Hogg's Account\r\n\r\n**From memoir \"Luck and Circumstance\" (2011):**\r\n\"At Twickenham, The Beatles, Yoko, and I, often joined by our cameraman Tony Richmond, would have a proper lunch in the small dining room up a flight of stairs, adjoining a bar where some crew members and studio office workers would be sinking their couple of pints of beer before going off to their own lunch…\r\n\r\nGeorge was usually with us, joining in the conversation, affable and friendly and interested in the give-and-take, but on the day of the Tunisian discussion, he wasn't with us as the meal started. At the morning rehearsal, I could tell by his silence and withdrawal that something was simmering inside him, and so in my role as documentarian, I'd asked our soundman to bug the flower pot on the lunch table.\r\n\r\nWe'd finished the first course when George arrived to stand at the end of the table.\r\n\r\nWe looked at him as he stood silent for a moment.\r\n\r\n'See you 'round the clubs,' he said.\r\n\r\nThat was his good-bye. He left.\r\n\r\nJohn, a person who reacted aggressively to provocation, immediately said, 'Let's get in Eric [Clapton]. He's just as good and not such a headache.'\r\n\r\nPaul and Ringo would not be drawn in, and after lunch we went back to the studio where Paul, John, and Ringo improvised a ferocious riff, half an hour of anger and frustration expressed with guitars and drums. Yoko sat on the edge of the rostrum on the blue cushion which had been George's and howled into his mike.\r\n\r\n(My bug had only picked up the sounds of cutlery banging on china plates, obscuring what the muffled voices had said.)\"\r\n\r\n**From Rolling Stone interview (November 2, 2021):**\r\n\"Well, I didn't have a key piece of information, which Peter now has. We used to have lunch together every day in the little commissary in Twickenham, and I got our sound guy to bug the flowerpot. George wasn't there at the beginning of the lunch, and then he came up and stood at the long end of the table. He's wearing this beautiful black corduroy hat, and he said, 'See you around the clubs.' Meaning, I'm off. And so I'll see you in the Scotch Club or the Ad Lib, but I'm gone [from the Beatles]. And John always reacted to provocation very quickly, and so he said, 'Oh, well, you know, let's get in Eric Clapton, he's not such a headache.'

Paul made sarcastic remark when James suggested Northern Songs primarily owned by Paul and John - hinted at Paul's frustration over ownership of Beatles' catalog. This foreshadowed events two months later (March 1969) when Dick James sold his shares in Northern Songs to ATV without consulting Paul or John, resulting in them losing control of own publishing rights - point of contention for Paul in decades to come.\r\n\r\n**Paul McCartney:** \"'Lisp Of A Baby's Prayer'... 'Alphabet Song.' What's that one?\"\r\n\r\n**Dick James:** \"Oh, Christ, I don't know the whole catalog yet. 4,000 songs is a lot to absorb\"\r\n\r\n**Ringo Starr:** \"'Nobody Loves a Fairy When She's Forty'\" [laughs]\r\n\r\n**Paul McCartney:** \"This is it? This is the lot?\"\r\n\r\n**Dick James:** \"This is a very good list. That's the entire catalog up to '65\"\r\n\r\n**Paul McCartney:** \"All of these are ours?\"\r\n\r\n**Dick James:** \"Yeah. Yeah\"\r\n\r\n**Michael Lindsay-Hogg:** \"Is this the catalog that's just gone on sale?\"\r\n\r\n**Dick James:** \"It's the one we just bought\"\r\n\r\n**Michael Lindsay-Hogg:** \"You bought it. Oh, great\"\r\n\r\n**Dick James:** \"Yeah, Northern Songs... Which includes Paul and John. And...\"\r\n\r\n**Paul McCartney:** \"Just about\"\r\n\r\n**Dick James:** \"What are you talking about, 'Just about'?\"\r\n\r\n**Paul McCartney:** \"Nothing. Uh, no comment\"\r\n\r\n**Dick James:** \"Very substantially, sir\"\r\n\r\n**Paul McCartney:** \"Yes, right. Okay\"\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n#### Conversation 2: After Lunch - George Quits\r\n\r\n**Context:** After lunch break, argument between George Harrison and John Lennon escalated, leading George to walk out of session and quit The Beatles.\r\n\r\n**George Harrison:** \"I think I'll be leaving the band now\"\r\n\r\n**John Lennon:** \"When?\"\r\n\r\n**George Harrison:** \"Now\" [...] \"Get a replacement. Write into the NME and get a few people\"\r\n\r\n**Mal Evans:** \"I'll ask George (Martin) to see about paying residuals\"\r\n\r\n**George Harrison:** \"But he shouldn't be bothered with that. You know, that's why we've got Apple, so that, you know, we attend to it ourselves\"\r\n\r\n**George's departure:** As George left Twickenham, told other Beatles: \"See you 'round the clubs\"\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n#### Conversation 3: Post-Departure - John & Paul Discuss \"She Said She Said\"\r\n\r\n**Context:** Michael Lindsay-Hogg arranged clandestine recording of John and Paul discussing George's sudden departure. During conversation, they referenced 1966 song \"She Said She Said,\" recalling how Paul had walked out of recording session after disagreement with John.\r\n\r\n**John Lennon:** \"Now the only regret about the past numbers is when, because I've been so frightened, I've allowed you to take it somewhere I didn't want...\"\r\n\r\n**Paul McCartney:** \"Yeah\"\r\n\r\n**John Lennon:** \"...and then my only chance was to let George take over, or interest George in it, because I knew he'd...\"\r\n\r\n**Paul McCartney:** \"'She Said She Said'...\"\r\n\r\n**John Lennon:** \"'She Said She Said'\"\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n#### Conversation 4: Post-Departure - Returning to Studio\r\n\r\n**Context:** After lunch, John, Paul and Ringo returned to studio.\r\n\r\n**Paul McCartney:** \"I don't know why we are coming back here for\"\r\n\r\n**John Lennon:** \"Just pretending nothing's happened\"\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n#### Conversation 5: John & Michael Lindsay-Hogg - Eric Clapton Discussion\r\n\r\n**Context:** After series of jams and performances, John spoke with Michael Lindsay-Hogg about band's next steps. During conversation, John suggested reaching out to Eric Clapton to take George's place if he didn't return.\r\n\r\n**John Lennon:** \"I think, if George doesn't come back by Monday or Tuesday, we'll ask Eric Clapton to play. Eric will be pleased ... He'd have enough scope to play the guitar. The point is, George leaves and do we want to carry on The Beatles? I certainly do\"\r\n\r\n**Michael Lindsay-Hogg:** \"Maybe for the show, I mean, you could just say George was sick\"\r\n\r\n**John Lennon:** \"No. I mean, if he leaves, he leaves\"\r\n\r\n**Michael Lindsay-Hogg:** \"What's the consensus? Do you want to go on with the show and the work?\"\r\n\r\n**John Lennon:** \"If he doesn't come back by Tuesday, we get Clapton\"\r\n\r\n**Michael Lindsay-Hogg:** \"Has anyone ever left as seriously as George before?\"\r\n\r\n**John Lennon:** \"Well... Ringo... We'll see how the weekend goes. There's a meeting\"\r\n\r\n**Michael:** \"I don't know. I was going to say, if George comes back we go away [i.e. abroad, to do the show], and if Clapton comes in we stay here. But I think if... I still think we should go away\"\r\n\r\n**John Lennon:** \"We should just go on, though, as if nothing's happened\"\r\n\r\n**Michael:** \"I think we should go away\"\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n#### Conversation 6: George Martin, Neil Aspinall & Michael Lindsay-Hogg - Why George Left\r\n\r\n**Context:** While John, Paul and Ringo jammed, George Martin, Neil Aspinall and Michael Lindsay-Hogg discussed why George might have left.\r\n\r\n**Michael Lindsay-Hogg:** \"The trouble is, once you leave, it's very hard to come back\"\r\n\r\n**Neil Aspinall:** \"Not really. We'll all have to meet him on Sunday, anyway. So he could be back, then. No, really, the box that George is in, it's him versus John and Paul when it comes to what they're gonna do and what they're gonna play. And you try doing that for a few months. You're going to end up pissed off\"\r\n\r\n**George Martin:** \"Well, the songwriting. They're our songwriting team and he's his own team. And if he's not working on his own song...\"\r\n\r\n**Michael Lindsay-Hogg:** \"Yes but, John and Paul aren't writing together much anymore, are they, really?\"\r\n\r\n**George Martin:** \"No, but nevertheless, they're still a team\"\r\n\r\n**Michael Lindsay-Hogg:** \"Yeah, 'cause it goes on the label that way\"\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n#### Conversation 7: End of Session - What To Do Next\r\n\r\n**Context:** Towards end of session, another group discussion touched on what to do next, without clear decision.\r\n\r\n**John Lennon:** \"So cats and kittens, what we gonna do?\"\r\n\r\n**Michael Lindsay-Hogg:** \"Hey, I've just been having some groovy ideas. So what's our next move?\"\r\n\r\n**John Lennon:** \"We split George's instruments\"\r\n\r\n**Michael Lindsay-Hogg:** \"You know, I was an actor when I was a kid\"\r\n\r\n**Ringo:** \"With Orson Welles\"\r\n\r\n**Michael Lindsay-Hogg:** \"The thing about Orson is he's very funny. We were in Belfast, rehearsing the stage version of 'Chimes of Midnight.' And one day he walked off the stage\"\r\n\r\n**Glyn Johns:** \"See you 'round the clubs\" [using same sentence George Harrison used when leaving Twickenham]\r\n\r\n**Michael Lindsay-Hogg:** \"See you 'round the clubs! ... He came back an hour later\" [...] \"I just think we ought to have a good location\"\r\n\r\n**Paul McCartney:** \"I think we should do it at The Cavern\"\r\n\r\n**Maureen Starkey:** \"Yes!\"\r\n\r\n**George Martin:** \"Location isn't really a main problem at the moment\"\r\n\r\n**Ringo:** \"No\"\r\n\r\n**Paul McCartney:** \"It's breathing, actually\"\r\n\r\n**Final moment:** Cameras captured brief conversation between John, Paul, and Ringo, all wearing their coats (audio not recorded).

It never came to blows, but I thought, ‘What’s the point of this? I’m quite capable of being relatively happy on my own and I’m not able to be happy in this situation. I’m getting out of here.’ Everybody had gone through that. Ringo had left at one point. I know John wanted out. It was a very, very difficult, stressful time, and being filmed having a row as well was terrible. I got up and I thought, ‘I’m not doing this any more. I’m out of here.’ So I got my guitar and went home and that afternoon wrote ‘Wah-Wah’.</p>\n<p>It became stifling, so that although this new album was supposed to break away from that type of recording (we were going back to playing live) it was still very much that kind of situation where he already had in his mind what he wanted. Paul wanted nobody to play on his songs until he decided how it should go. For me it was like: ‘What am I doing here? This is painful!’</p>\n<p>Then superimposed on top of that was Yoko, and there were negative vibes at that time. John and Yoko were out on a limb. I don’t think he wanted much to be hanging out with us, and I think Yoko was pushing him out of the band, inasmuch as she didn’t want him hanging out with us.</p>\n<p>It’s important to state that a lot of water has gone under the bridge and that, as we talk now, everybody’s good friends and we have a better understanding of the past. But talking about what was happening at that time, you can see it was strange”</p>\n<p><strong>From Keith Badman ‘Off the Record’ (2008):</strong>\r\n“That period was the low of all time. In normal circumstances, I had not let his attitude bother me and, to get a peaceful life, I had always let him have his own way, even when this meant that songs, which I had composed, were not being recorded. In front of the cameras, as we were actually being filmed, Paul started to get at me about the way I was playing. Everybody had left at one time or another, but I left during Let It Be. When I left, there’s a scene where Paul and I are having an argument and we’re trying to cover it up. Then, the next scene, I’m not there and Yoko’s just screaming, doing her screeching number. Well, that’s where I had left, and I went home and wrote ‘Wah Wah’. It’d given me a wah-wah, like I had such a headache with that whole argument. It was such a headache”</p>\n<p><strong>George’s diary entry for January 10:</strong>\r\n“January 10. Got up. Went to Twickenham. Rehearsed until lunchtime. Left The Beatles. Went home”</p>\n<h3 id=\"other-beatles-perspectives\">Other Beatles’ Perspectives</h3>\n<p><strong>Ringo Starr (Keith Badman ‘Off the Record’ 2008):</strong>\r\n“George had to leave because he thought Paul was dominating him. Well, he was because Michael Lindsay-Hogg liked Paul, I would think, more than the rest of us. So, it’s like Paul’s film, actually”</p>\n<p><strong>George Martin (Keith Badman ‘Off the Record’ 2008):</strong>\r\n“In order to get things together, Paul would organise everyone and be rather bossy, which the other boys didn’t like. But, it was the only way of getting it together. John would drift away with Yoko and George would say he wouldn’t be coming in the following day. It was general disenchantment”</p>\n<h3 id=\"michael-lindsay-hoggs-account\">Michael Lindsay-Hogg’s Account</h3>\n<p><strong>From memoir “Luck and Circumstance” (2011):</strong>\r\n“At Twickenham, The Beatles, Yoko, and I, often joined by our cameraman Tony Richmond, would have a proper lunch in the small dining room up a flight of stairs, adjoining a bar where some crew members and studio office workers would be sinking their couple of pints of beer before going off to their own lunch…</p>\n<p>George was usually with us, joining in the conversation, affable and friendly and interested in the give-and-take, but on the day of the Tunisian discussion, he wasn’t with us as the meal started. At the morning rehearsal, I could tell by his silence and withdrawal that something was simmering inside him, and so in my role as documentarian, I’d asked our soundman to bug the flower pot on the lunch table.</p>\n<p>We’d finished the first course when George arrived to stand at the end of the table.</p>\n<p>We looked at him as he stood silent for a moment.</p>\n<p>‘See you ‘round the clubs,’ he said.</p>\n<p>That was his good-bye. He left.</p>\n<p>John, a person who reacted aggressively to provocation, immediately said, ‘Let’s get in Eric [Clapton]. He’s just as good and not such a headache.’</p>\n<p>Paul and Ringo would not be drawn in, and after lunch we went back to the studio where Paul, John, and Ringo improvised a ferocious riff, half an hour of anger and frustration expressed with guitars and drums. Yoko sat on the edge of the rostrum on the blue cushion which had been George’s and howled into his mike.</p>\n<p>(My bug had only picked up the sounds of cutlery banging on china plates, obscuring what the muffled voices had said.)”</p>\n<p><strong>From Rolling Stone interview (November 2, 2021):</strong>\r\n“Well, I didn’t have a key piece of information, which Peter now has. We used to have lunch together every day in the little commissary in Twickenham, and I got our sound guy to bug the flowerpot. George wasn’t there at the beginning of the lunch, and then he came up and stood at the long end of the table. He’s wearing this beautiful black corduroy hat, and he said, ‘See you around the clubs.’ Meaning, I’m off. And so I’ll see you in the Scotch Club or the Ad Lib, but I’m gone [from the Beatles]. And John always reacted to provocation very quickly, and so he said, ‘Oh, well, you know, let’s get in Eric Clapton, he’s not such a headache.’ But when I played back the audio, all I got was the clatter of cutlery and plates and [inaudible] voices.

The three Beatles returned to Twickenham the following day (January 14).\r\n\r\n### Overall Atmosphere\r\n\r\n**Context:**\r\n- Just days after George Harrison walked out (January 10)\r\n- Meeting at Ringo's house previous day (January 12) only deepened divide\r\n- George retreated to Liverpool for rest of week\r\n- Tensions among remaining members remained high\r\n\r\n**Attendance:**\r\n- George's absence cast shadow over session\r\n- John also notably missing for much of day\r\n- Ringo arrived first\r\n- Followed by Paul and Linda Eastman (Paul's girlfriend)\r\n- Efforts to contact John unsuccessful until late morning\r\n- John eventually arrived after lunch\r\n\r\n**Morning marked by revealing conversations:**\r\n- Between Paul, Ringo, and Linda\r\n- Regarding John's relationship with Yoko Ono\r\n- Growing fractures within band\r\n- Set tone for largely unproductive day\r\n\r\n**Pivotal lunchtime conversation:**\r\n- Between Paul and John in cafeteria\r\n- Surreptitiously recorded by hidden microphone placed in flowerpot by Michael Lindsay-Hogg's crew\r\n- Later restored and included in Peter Jackson's 2021 \"Get Back\" documentary\r\n- Offered insight into group's mindset\r\n- **John's frustrations:** Band's formulaic approach to music, reflected on creative excitement of earlier albums like Revolver, speculated about going solo (though unsure about leaving Beatles)\r\n- **Paul's encouragement:** Focus on performing well rather than obsessing over minor song details, deliberated over how to guide George's contributions constructively\r\n\r\n**Live performance schedule:**\r\n- Tentatively scheduled for January 19 (rehearsal) and 20 (concert)\r\n- During day, group agreed to postpone to January 26 and 27\r\n- In hope of George coming back\r\n\r\n**Musical work attempted:**\r\n- Despite tensions, some work attempted\r\n- Three remaining Beatles spent afternoon refining \"Get Back\"\r\n- Paul experimenting with lyrics\r\n- Finalized Jo Jo's hometown as Tucson, Arizona\r\n- Overall mood subdued\r\n\r\n**Session end:** Ended early, around 5 p.m.\r\n\r\n### Main Songs Recorded\r\n\r\n#### Get Back (Paul)\r\n\r\n**This session:**\r\n- Three remaining Beatles spent afternoon refining song\r\n- Paul experimenting with lyrics\r\n- **Finalized:** Jo Jo's hometown as Tucson, Arizona\r\n\r\n### Chronological Conversations\r\n\r\n#### Conversation 1: Morning - Mal, Ringo & Michael - Meeting Discussion\r\n\r\n**Context:** First to arrive for session, started day discussing meeting held previous day.\r\n\r\n**Mal Evans:** \"How was the meeting?\"\r\n\r\n**Ringo Starr:** \"The meeting was fine. A lot of good things, but then, you know, they all sort of fell apart in the end\"\r\n\r\n**Michael Lindsay-Hogg:** \"I just spoke to Neil [Aspinall], who's calling a couple of your colleagues, to see if they're also gonna come\"\r\n\r\n**Ringo Starr:** \"Couple of colleagues told me last night that they would be there the same time\"\r\n\r\n**Michael Lindsay-Hogg:** \"Neil expressed an opinion that no one was coming\"\r\n\r\n**Ringo Starr:** \"Well, phone Neil and tell him I'm here for lunch. Have you got enough for a good documentary?\"\r\n\r\n**Michael Lindsay-Hogg:** \"It depends how liquid the situation is\"\r\n\r\n**Ringo Starr:** \"Use it all\"\r\n\r\n**Michael Lindsay-Hogg:** \"Well, in other words, if we tell it like it is, then we've got a very good documentary. But if…\"\r\n\r\n**Ringo Starr:** \"We're hiding\"\r\n\r\n**Michael Lindsay-Hogg:** \"If we're hiding, then we don't have much of a documentary. We just have a couple of days when things didn't work out, that's it\"\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n#### Conversation 2: Paul & Linda Arrive\r\n\r\n**Michael Lindsay-Hogg:** \"Neil spoke to me and he said… He, A, said he'd call me back at 11:15. And, B, he said he didn't think anyone was gonna show. Then when I arrived back RS was here\"\r\n\r\n**Paul McCartney:** \"And PM was on his way. And JL was in bed\"\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n#### Conversation 3: John & Yoko - Will John Join?\r\n\r\n**Context:** Joined by Neil Aspinall and Glyn Johns. Discussion turned to John and Yoko and whether John will join session this day.\r\n\r\n**Ringo Starr:** \"Did you get in touch with John?\"\r\n\r\n**Neil Aspinall:** \"I couldn't get him\"\r\n\r\n**Michael Lindsay-Hogg:** \"Is he joining?\"\r\n\r\n**Neil Aspinall:** \"I don't know. I haven't spoken to him. Nobody answers his phone\"\r\n\r\n**Linda Eastman:** \"'Cause I have a feeling that half the stuff Yoko said yesterday isn't… She was talking for John. And I don't think he really believed any of that, you know?\"\r\n\r\n**Paul McCartney:** \"No, so, it's… John didn't talk, so Yoko talked for John\"\r\n\r\n**Michael Lindsay-Hogg:** \"Did George stay?\"\r\n\r\n**Paul McCartney:** \"In the middle of all that, actually… George went. He said 'I'll see you…' See, but their point is that they're trying to be as near together as they can. They wanna stay together, those two. So it's all right. Let the young lovers stay together. But it's not that bad, you know. We got a lot out of Beatles, so that if… I think John's thing now… If it came to a push between Yoko and The Beatles, it's Yoko\"\r\n\r\n**Michael Lindsay-Hogg:** \"Funny enough, the other day when we were talking, John had said that he really did not want not to be a Beatle… Were you writing together much more before she came around?\"\r\n\r\n**Paul McCartney:** \"Oh, yeah. Sure. We'd cooled it because we were not playing together. 'Cause we lived together when we played together. We were in the same hotel, up at the same time every morning, all day. As long as you're this close all day, so something grows. And then when you're not this close, just physically, something goes. Actually, musically, we can play better than we've ever been able to play. You know, we're all right on that. It's just that being together thing. It's difficult starting right from scratch with Yoko there. 'Cause I start out writing songs about white walls. (Laughs) Just 'cause I think John and Yoko would like that. And they wouldn't. She's great, she really is alright. They just want to be near each other. So, I just think it's just silly of me or anyone to try and say to them, 'No, you can't.' It's like that we're striking 'cause work conditions aren't right. But it shouldn't be. 'Can't operate under these conditions, boy. We're coming out.' It's like they're going overboard about it. But John always does, you know. You can't go saying, 'Be sensible about it and don't bring her to meetings.' It's his decision, that. It's none of our business, like, interfering in that\"\r\n\r\n**Neil Aspinall:** \"But there's still got to be that little bit of compromise\"\r\n\r\n**Paul McCartney:** \"Well, I think for them to be able to compromise, I have to be able to compromise first. Then they'll be able to. But it's silly, neither of us compromising. We probably do need, really, sort of a central daddy figure to say, you know, 'Nine o'clock, leave your girls at home, lads.' You know, we're all… But it's gonna be such an incredible sort of comical thing, like, in 50 years' time, 'They broke up 'cause Yoko sat on an amp.' Just something like that. 'What?' 'You see, John kept bringing this girl along.' 'What?' It's not as though there's any sort of earth-splitting rows or anything… Do you want to try and ring John?\"\r\n\r\n**Neil Aspinall:** \"Mal was trying to ring but it was permanently engaged\"\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n#### Conversation 4: Lunch - John & Paul Secret Recording (Part 1: George's Situation)\r\n\r\n**Context:** Paul got John on phone, who said he was coming. John arrived at lunchtime. He and Paul went to cafeteria for private conversation, unaware film-makers planted hidden microphone in flowerpot.\r\n\r\n**John Lennon:** \"It's like George said, he didn't get enough satisfaction anymore, because of the compromise he had to make to be together. It's a festering wound that we've allowed to… and yesterday we allowed it to go even deeper, and we didn't give him any bandages. And when he is that far in, we have egos\"\r\n\r\n**Paul McCartney:** \"The thing is, that's what I was trying to say to George, you know. Whereas previously I would have said, 'Take it there with diddle-der-diddle-der'. But I was trying last week to say, 'Now take it there. Anything you like. Put whatever you…'\"\r\n\r\n**John Lennon:** \"You see, the point is now, we both do that to George this time, and because of the build-up to it\"\r\n\r\n**Paul McCartney:** \"Yeah, we treat him a bit like that. See, 'cause he knows what we're on about. But I do think that he's right. That's why I think we've got the problem now, you know, the four of us. You go one way, George one way, and me another. But I know it'll apply to all of us, if one day you can all be singing like you sing. George can be really playing, I mean, like he plays, not like I keep trying to make him play\"\r\n\r\n**John Lennon:** \"Yeah, OK, because you're afraid that how he'll play won't be like you want him to play, and that's what we do, and that's what you do to me. And I'm not gonna tell you what to play\"\r\n\r\n**Paul McCartney:** \"See, that… that seems to be the trouble, is that if you'd have been able to say that on the occasion, just even to say, 'Look, I'm not gonna say anything about the song because it's very difficult, I'm gonna really try and now…'\"\r\n\r\n**John Lennon:** \"You know, I've always done the numbers like that. Now, the only regret about the past numbers is when, because I've been so frightened, I've allowed you to take it somewhere where I didn't want. And then, that my only chance was to let George take over, or interest George in it. If you give me your suggestions, let me reject them and pinch the ones I like… is where my writing side is. Same goes for the arranging. I don't want it to… I don't know\"\r\n\r\n**Paul McCartney:** \"I know. I do know. I know what you mean, yeah\"\r\n\r\n**John Lennon:** \"'Cause there was a period where none of us could actually say anything about your arrangements 'cause you would reject it all. I'd have to tell George and I would just say, you know, like you do about me. You know, 'I'm Paul McCartney', and a lot of the times you were right, and a lot of the times you were wrong. Same as we always are. But I can't see the answer to that, because you've suddenly got it all, you see\"\r\n\r\n**Paul McCartney:** \"I really don't want you…\"\r\n\r\n**John Lennon:** \"Well all right. I'm just telling you what I think. I don't The Beatles revolve around the four people. It might a fu*king job\"\r\n\r\n**Paul McCartney:** \"You know, but I tell you what. I tell you one thing, what I think. The main thing is this: you have always been boss. Now I've been, sort of, secondary boss\"\r\n\r\n**John Lennon:** \"Not always\"\r\n\r\n**Paul McCartney:** \"No, listen. Listen. No, always! Really, I mean, it is gonna be much better if we can actually just stick together and say, 'Look George, on 'I've Got A Feeling' I want you to do it exactly like I play it.' And he'll say, 'I'm not you, and I can't do it exactly like you do it.'\"\r\n\r\n**John Lennon:** \"But this year, what you've been doing, and what everybody's been doing, I've not only felt guilty about the way we're all guilty about our relationship to each other, 'cause we could do more. And look, I'm not putting any blame on you. I've suddenly realised this, because that was my game, you know, but goals, they're still the same. Self-preservation, you know. I know what I like, I've let you do what you want and George too, you know\"\r\n\r\n**Paul McCartney:** \"Yeah, I know\"\r\n\r\n**John Lennon:** \"If we want him, if we do want him, I can go along with that, because the policy has kept us together\"\r\n\r\n**Paul McCartney:** \"Well, I don't know, you know. See, I'm just assuming he's coming back. If he isn't, then he isn't, then it's a new problem. And probably when we're all very old, we'll all agree with each other, and we'll all sing together\"\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n#### Conversation 5: Live Show Postponement\r\n\r\n**Michael Lindsay-Hogg:** \"I think at some point we should talk conceptually about the show\"\r\n\r\n**Paul McCartney:** \"Okay, we have to be flexible, but we're gonna have to be very flexible now. Which is like, the 18th today has changed to the 19th. 'Cause we lost a day today. Tomorrow it will change to the 20th. The day after, it will change to the 21st. If George comes back, yeah. Put it back a full week, yeah\"\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n#### Conversation 6: Linda & John - White Album Discussion\r\n\r\n**Context:** From 'a moral to this song' blog - While Yoko and Paul conduct own conversation, Linda talks to John about inevitable difficulties any relationship faces (even in musical partnership) and why it doesn't prove relationship itself is expired. John laments White Album doesn't sound like genuine, inspired band collaboration achieved in past.\r\n\r\n**Linda:** \"You were saying that—\"\r\n\r\n**John:** [pained] \"It's like George said. It just doesn't give me the same sort of satisfaction anymore. Because of the compromise we'd have to make, to be together\" [long pause] \"You know, it's that the end result of the records now aren't… enough. Because now, we – we know it so clearly, how we arrived at it, and for what it was and all. Before, it was always a surprise when we – you know. We weren't so aware of how we reacted to it. When the – something came out, like Revolver or Pepper or whatever, there was still that element of surprise that we didn't know where it came from. But now we know exactly where it came from, and how we arrived at that particular noise, and how it could have been… much better. Or it needn't have been at all. The only way to do it – satisfactory, for y– yourself – is to do it on your own. And then that's fucking hard\"\r\n\r\n**Linda:** \"But you were saying yesterday, you know. And you know something, you – you've always been sort of thinking that it can't be any better than it was; you're not just a studio musician. You always say it. I mean, [inaudible] – I'm saying, hey, you make good music together. And you like it or not, you know\"\r\n\r\n**John:** [furtive] \"I like it\"\r\n\r\n**Linda:** \"And making good music is also—\"\r\n\r\n**John:** \"But it's just—\"\r\n\r\n**Linda:** \"It's really hard working at a relationship\"\r\n\r\n**John:** \"I – I know\"\r\n\r\n**Linda:** \"Of course! That's what you said yesterday. It happens all the time, you know. And you also said you wanted [inaudible] The Beatles—\"\r\n\r\n**John:** \"It's like all of us are dissatisfied with The Beatles LP. Now, it's not because the way we got on doing it, because the end result was – was as good as it could've been. And – I don't know what the reason could be\" [offhand] \"Mal, could you get a little glass of wine?\"\r\n\r\n**Mal:** \"Yeah. Red, or—?\"\r\n\r\n**John:** \"If I get down to my contributions, then I'm satisfied, you know. But the whole thing is less satisfactory\"\r\n\r\n**Ringo:** \"But I enjoy it more\"\r\n\r\n**John:** \"But individually. Name any of them! There is no [inaudible]. Even George's numbers are more satisfactory than any numbers we've done before. But as a whole thing, it's just not satisfactory to me\"\r\n\r\n**Ringo:** \"Well, I mean, I dig it far more than Sgt. Pepper or anything—\"\r\n\r\n**Linda:** \"You know, it really—\"\r\n\r\n**John:** \"And I dig it too. I dig it, individually, far more than Sgt. Pepper. But as a whole – as a Beatles thing, I think it didn't – it couldn't work as a Beatles thing. I think it's one of the best Beatles work we could have, you know, but as a – as an entity, as a whole coming out of all of us here – no\"\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n#### Conversation 7: Lunch - John & Paul Secret Recording (Part 2: Creative Process)\r\n\r\n**Context:** From 'a moral to this song' blog - In midst of personal discussion about working together within band, John tries to explain disconnect in their process, and why he can't envision their songs the way Paul can. Both circle around issues of honest communication and (living up to) each other's expectations, eventually project onto George, bringing George into quandary of Lennon-McCartney partnership.\r\n\r\n**John:** \"And that's all I did on the last album was say, 'Okay, Paul, you're out to decide where my songs are concerned, arrangement-wise'\" [exasperated] \"I don't know the songs, you know. I'd sooner just sing them, than have them turn into – into 'Mr. Kite', or anything else, where— I've accepted the problem from you that it needs arrangement. And then, because I'm an ape, I don't know. I don't see any further than me, the guitar, and the drums, and – and George Martin doing the— I don't hear any of the flutes playing, you know? I suppose I could hear 'em if I sat down and worked very hard! I could turn out a mathematical drawing if you'd like, but I could never do it off me own backside, I always have to just – [brushing sound from strumming motion] do that, you know?\"\r\n\r\n**Paul:** \"Yeah\"\r\n\r\n**John:** \"I mean—\"\r\n\r\n**Paul:** [quiet] \"Yeah. Yeah\" [pause] \"I'm onto the same thing, you know. That's – that's – we're all at that. It is only, like, if you can just remember that we're – you know. That the four of us are trying to do that. Because I mean, all of those things you say, you know, in some way, apply to me. Not all ways—\"\r\n\r\n**John:** \"Yes, yes, because everything applies a little bit to you, too\"\r\n\r\n**Paul:** [inaudible] \"—it is just you saying it. They're all – you know, in some way, to some degree, will apply to me\"\r\n\r\n**John:** \"'Cause once there was a period where none of us could actually, uh, say anything, about your criticisms\"\r\n\r\n**Paul:** [quiet] \"Yeah. Yeah\"\r\n\r\n**John:** [bleak] \"'Cause you would reject it all\"\r\n\r\n**Paul:** [quiet] \"Yeah, sure\"\r\n\r\n**John:** \"And so George and I would just go – you know, 'I'll give you a line here,' 'Okay,' you know, 'We'll do four in a bar, and I'll do…' And a lot of the times you were right\"\r\n\r\n**Paul:** \"Yeah\"\r\n\r\n**John:** \"But a lot of the times you were – [the songs were] the same as they always are. But I can't see the answer to that\"\r\n\r\n**Paul:** \"No, but – no, that's good you see. The thing is, like, within each other, within ourselves, we reach something that's nearly perfect. And everyone else who's listening will think, 'That's it. They've got it.' You know – you know what I mean. So okay, we know we nearly made it, but we've really made it, for everyone else. 'Cause it's okay, we're into the fine, finest, finest technicalities – I mean, that's where it's at, you know.

And I don’t think he really believed any of that, you know?”</p>\n<p><strong>Paul McCartney:</strong> “No, so, it’s… John didn’t talk, so Yoko talked for John”</p>\n<p><strong>Michael Lindsay-Hogg:</strong> “Did George stay?”</p>\n<p><strong>Paul McCartney:</strong> “In the middle of all that, actually… George went. He said ‘I’ll see you…’ See, but their point is that they’re trying to be as near together as they can. They wanna stay together, those two. So it’s all right. Let the young lovers stay together. But it’s not that bad, you know. We got a lot out of Beatles, so that if… I think John’s thing now… If it came to a push between Yoko and The Beatles, it’s Yoko”</p>\n<p><strong>Michael Lindsay-Hogg:</strong> “Funny enough, the other day when we were talking, John had said that he really did not want not to be a Beatle… Were you writing together much more before she came around?”</p>\n<p><strong>Paul McCartney:</strong> “Oh, yeah. Sure. We’d cooled it because we were not playing together. ‘Cause we lived together when we played together. We were in the same hotel, up at the same time every morning, all day. As long as you’re this close all day, so something grows. And then when you’re not this close, just physically, something goes. Actually, musically, we can play better than we’ve ever been able to play. You know, we’re all right on that. It’s just that being together thing. It’s difficult starting right from scratch with Yoko there. ‘Cause I start out writing songs about white walls. (Laughs) Just ‘cause I think John and Yoko would like that. And they wouldn’t. She’s great, she really is alright. They just want to be near each other. So, I just think it’s just silly of me or anyone to try and say to them, ‘No, you can’t.’ It’s like that we’re striking ‘cause work conditions aren’t right. But it shouldn’t be. ‘Can’t operate under these conditions, boy. We’re coming out.’ It’s like they’re going overboard about it. But John always does, you know. You can’t go saying, ‘Be sensible about it and don’t bring her to meetings.’ It’s his decision, that. It’s none of our business, like, interfering in that”</p>\n<p><strong>Neil Aspinall:</strong> “But there’s still got to be that little bit of compromise”</p>\n<p><strong>Paul McCartney:</strong> “Well, I think for them to be able to compromise, I have to be able to compromise first. Then they’ll be able to. But it’s silly, neither of us compromising. We probably do need, really, sort of a central daddy figure to say, you know, ‘Nine o’clock, leave your girls at home, lads.’ You know, we’re all… But it’s gonna be such an incredible sort of comical thing, like, in 50 years’ time, ‘They broke up ‘cause Yoko sat on an amp.’ Just something like that. ‘What?’ ‘You see, John kept bringing this girl along.’ ‘What?’ It’s not as though there’s any sort of earth-splitting rows or anything… Do you want to try and ring John?”</p>\n<p><strong>Neil Aspinall:</strong> “Mal was trying to ring but it was permanently engaged”</p>\n<hr>\n<h4 id=\"conversation-4-lunch---john--paul-secret-recording-part-1-georges-situation\">Conversation 4: Lunch - John &#x26; Paul Secret Recording (Part 1: George’s Situation)</h4>\n<p><strong>Context:</strong> Paul got John on phone, who said he was coming. John arrived at lunchtime. He and Paul went to cafeteria for private conversation, unaware film-makers planted hidden microphone in flowerpot.</p>\n<p><strong>John Lennon:</strong> “It’s like George said, he didn’t get enough satisfaction anymore, because of the compromise he had to make to be together. It’s a festering wound that we’ve allowed to… and yesterday we allowed it to go even deeper, and we didn’t give him any bandages. And when he is that far in, we have egos”</p>\n<p><strong>Paul McCartney:</strong> “The thing is, that’s what I was trying to say to George, you know. Whereas previously I would have said, ‘Take it there with diddle-der-diddle-der’. But I was trying last week to say, ‘Now take it there. Anything you like. Put whatever you…’”</p>\n<p><strong>John Lennon:</strong> “You see, the point is now, we both do that to George this time, and because of the build-up to it”</p>\n<p><strong>Paul McCartney:</strong> “Yeah, we treat him a bit like that. See, ‘cause he knows what we’re on about. But I do think that he’s right. That’s why I think we’ve got the problem now, you know, the four of us. You go one way, George one way, and me another. But I know it’ll apply to all of us, if one day you can all be singing like you sing. George can be really playing, I mean, like he plays, not like I keep trying to make him play”</p>\n<p><strong>John Lennon:</strong> “Yeah, OK, because you’re afraid that how he’ll play won’t be like you want him to play, and that’s what we do, and that’s what you do to me. And I’m not gonna tell you what to play”</p>\n<p><strong>Paul McCartney:</strong> “See, that… that seems to be the trouble, is that if you’d have been able to say that on the occasion, just even to say, ‘Look, I’m not gonna say anything about the song because it’s very difficult, I’m gonna really try and now…’”</p>\n<p><strong>John Lennon:</strong> “You know, I’ve always done the numbers like that. Now, the only regret about the past numbers is when, because I’ve been so frightened, I’ve allowed you to take it somewhere where I didn’t want. And then, that my only chance was to let George take over, or interest George in it. If you give me your suggestions, let me reject them and pinch the ones I like… is where my writing side is. Same goes for the arranging. I don’t want it to… I don’t know”</p>\n<p><strong>Paul McCartney:</strong> “I know. I do know. I know what you mean, yeah”</p>\n<p><strong>John Lennon:</strong> “‘Cause there was a period where none of us could actually say anything about your arrangements ‘cause you would reject it all. I’d have to tell George and I would just say, you know, like you do about me. You know, ‘I’m Paul McCartney’, and a lot of the times you were right, and a lot of the times you were wrong. Same as we always are. But I can’t see the answer to that, because you’ve suddenly got it all, you see”</p>\n<p><strong>Paul McCartney:</strong> “I really don’t want you…”</p>\n<p><strong>John Lennon:</strong> “Well all right. I’m just telling you what I think. I don’t The Beatles revolve around the four people. It might a fu*king job”</p>\n<p><strong>Paul McCartney:</strong> “You know, but I tell you what. I tell you one thing, what I think. The main thing is this: you have always been boss. Now I’ve been, sort of, secondary boss”</p>\n<p><strong>John Lennon:</strong> “Not always”</p>\n<p><strong>Paul McCartney:</strong> “No, listen. Listen. No, always! Really, I mean, it is gonna be much better if we can actually just stick together and say, ‘Look George, on ‘I’ve Got A Feeling’ I want you to do it exactly like I play it.’ And he’ll say, ‘I’m not you, and I can’t do it exactly like you do it.’”</p>\n<p><strong>John Lennon:</strong> “But this year, what you’ve been doing, and what everybody’s been doing, I’ve not only felt guilty about the way we’re all guilty about our relationship to each other, ‘cause we could do more. And look, I’m not putting any blame on you. I’ve suddenly realised this, because that was my game, you know, but goals, they’re still the same. Self-preservation, you know. I know what I like, I’ve let you do what you want and George too, you know”</p>\n<p><strong>Paul McCartney:</strong> “Yeah, I know”</p>\n<p><strong>John Lennon:</strong> “If we want him, if we do want him, I can go along with that, because the policy has kept us together”</p>\n<p><strong>Paul McCartney:</strong> “Well, I don’t know, you know. See, I’m just assuming he’s coming back. If he isn’t, then he isn’t, then it’s a new problem. And probably when we’re all very old, we’ll all agree with each other, and we’ll all sing together”</p>\n<hr>\n<h4 id=\"conversation-5-live-show-postponement\">Conversation 5: Live Show Postponement</h4>\n<p><strong>Michael Lindsay-Hogg:</strong> “I think at some point we should talk conceptually about the show”</p>\n<p><strong>Paul McCartney:</strong> “Okay, we have to be flexible, but we’re gonna have to be very flexible now. Which is like, the 18th today has changed to the 19th. ‘Cause we lost a day today. Tomorrow it will change to the 20th. The day after, it will change to the 21st. If George comes back, yeah. Put it back a full week, yeah”</p>\n<hr>\n<h4 id=\"conversation-6-linda--john---white-album-discussion\">Conversation 6: Linda &#x26; John - White Album Discussion</h4>\n<p><strong>Context:</strong> From ‘a moral to this song’ blog - While Yoko and Paul conduct own conversation, Linda talks to John about inevitable difficulties any relationship faces (even in musical partnership) and why it doesn’t prove relationship itself is expired. John laments White Album doesn’t sound like genuine, inspired band collaboration achieved in past.</p>\n<p><strong>Linda:</strong> “You were saying that—”</p>\n<p><strong>John:</strong> [pained] “It’s like George said. It just doesn’t give me the same sort of satisfaction anymore. Because of the compromise we’d have to make, to be together” [long pause] “You know, it’s that the end result of the records now aren’t… enough. Because now, we – we know it so clearly, how we arrived at it, and for what it was and all. Before, it was always a surprise when we – you know. We weren’t so aware of how we reacted to it. When the – something came out, like Revolver or Pepper or whatever, there was still that element of surprise that we didn’t know where it came from. But now we know exactly where it came from, and how we arrived at that particular noise, and how it could have been… much better. Or it needn’t have been at all. The only way to do it – satisfactory, for y– yourself – is to do it on your own. And then that’s fucking hard”</p>\n<p><strong>Linda:</strong> “But you were saying yesterday, you know. And you know something, you – you’ve always been sort of thinking that it can’t be any better than it was; you’re not just a studio musician. You always say it. I mean, [inaudible] – I’m saying, hey, you make good music together. And you like it or not, you know”</p>\n<p><strong>John:</strong> [furtive] “I like it”</p>\n<p><strong>Linda:</strong> “And making good music is also—”</p>\n<p><strong>John:</strong> “But it’s just—”</p>\n<p><strong>Linda:</strong> “It’s really hard working at a relationship”</p>\n<p><strong>John:</strong> “I – I know”</p>\n<p><strong>Linda:</strong> “Of course! That’s what you said yesterday. It happens all the time, you know. And you also said you wanted [inaudible] The Beatles—”</p>\n<p><strong>John:</strong> “It’s like all of us are dissatisfied with The Beatles LP. Now, it’s not because the way we got on doing it, because the end result was – was as good as it could’ve been. And – I don’t know what the reason could be” [offhand] “Mal, could you get a little glass of wine?”</p>\n<p><strong>Mal:</strong> “Yeah. Red, or—?”</p>\n<p><strong>John:</strong> “If I get down to my contributions, then I’m satisfied, you know. But the whole thing is less satisfactory”</p>\n<p><strong>Ringo:</strong> “But I enjoy it more”</p>\n<p><strong>John:</strong> “But individually. Name any of them! There is no [inaudible]. Even George’s numbers are more satisfactory than any numbers we’ve done before. But as a whole thing, it’s just not satisfactory to me”</p>\n<p><strong>Ringo:</strong> “Well, I mean, I dig it far more than Sgt. Pepper or anything—”</p>\n<p><strong>Linda:</strong> “You know, it really—”</p>\n<p><strong>John:</strong> “And I dig it too. I dig it, individually, far more than Sgt. Pepper. But as a whole – as a Beatles thing, I think it didn’t – it couldn’t work as a Beatles thing. I think it’s one of the best Beatles work we could have, you know, but as a – as an entity, as a whole coming out of all of us here – no”</p>\n<hr>\n<h4 id=\"conversation-7-lunch---john--paul-secret-recording-part-2-creative-process\">Conversation 7: Lunch - John &#x26; Paul Secret Recording (Part 2: Creative Process)</h4>\n<p><strong>Context:</strong> From ‘a moral to this song’ blog - In midst of personal discussion about working together within band, John tries to explain disconnect in their process, and why he can’t envision their songs the way Paul can. Both circle around issues of honest communication and (living up to) each other’s expectations, eventually project onto George, bringing George into quandary of Lennon-McCartney partnership.</p>\n<p><strong>John:</strong> “And that’s all I did on the last album was say, ‘Okay, Paul, you’re out to decide where my songs are concerned, arrangement-wise’” [exasperated] “I don’t know the songs, you know. I’d sooner just sing them, than have them turn into – into ‘Mr. Kite’, or anything else, where— I’ve accepted the problem from you that it needs arrangement. And then, because I’m an ape, I don’t know. I don’t see any further than me, the guitar, and the drums, and – and George Martin doing the— I don’t hear any of the flutes playing, you know? I suppose I could hear ‘em if I sat down and worked very hard! I could turn out a mathematical drawing if you’d like, but I could never do it off me own backside, I always have to just – [brushing sound from strumming motion] do that, you know?”</p>\n<p><strong>Paul:</strong> “Yeah”</p>\n<p><strong>John:</strong> “I mean—”</p>\n<p><strong>Paul:</strong> [quiet] “Yeah. Yeah” [pause] “I’m onto the same thing, you know. That’s – that’s – we’re all at that. It is only, like, if you can just remember that we’re – you know. That the four of us are trying to do that. Because I mean, all of those things you say, you know, in some way, apply to me. Not all ways—”</p>\n<p><strong>John:</strong> “Yes, yes, because everything applies a little bit to you, too”</p>\n<p><strong>Paul:</strong> [inaudible] “—it is just you saying it. They’re all – you know, in some way, to some degree, will apply to me”</p>\n<p><strong>John:</strong> “‘Cause once there was a period where none of us could actually, uh, say anything, about your criticisms”</p>\n<p><strong>Paul:</strong> [quiet] “Yeah. Yeah”</p>\n<p><strong>John:</strong> [bleak] “‘Cause you would reject it all”</p>\n<p><strong>Paul:</strong> [quiet] “Yeah, sure”</p>\n<p><strong>John:</strong> “And so George and I would just go – you know, ‘I’ll give you a line here,’ ‘Okay,’ you know, ‘We’ll do four in a bar, and I’ll do…’ And a lot of the times you were right”</p>\n<p><strong>Paul:</strong> “Yeah”</p>\n<p><strong>John:</strong> “But a lot of the times you were – [the songs were] the same as they always are. But I can’t see the answer to that”</p>\n<p><strong>Paul:</strong> “No, but – no, that’s good you see. The thing is, like, within each other, within ourselves, we reach something that’s nearly perfect. And everyone else who’s listening will think, ‘That’s it. They’ve got it.’ You know – you know what I mean. So okay, we know we nearly made it, but we’ve really made it, for everyone else. ‘Cause it’s okay, we’re into the fine, finest, finest technicalities – I mean, that’s where it’s at, you know. If one day, we can even keep all – if all the people who are listening to this, nearly nearly made it, they’ll think we’ve made it, you know. They’ll think that’s it. So okay, if we can nearly, if we can creep up on it – and that’s, see, that’s what I’m trying to do. Like last week, yesterday [inaudible] doing alright for me, I was really trying to just say to George, ‘Take it there,’ you know, whereas I wouldn’t have gone [inaudible] and said, ‘Take it there – with diddle-a-diddle-a-da.’ But I was trying last week, to say, ‘Now, take it over there, and it needs to be like – but, oh, what, like, whatever you—’”</p>\n<p><strong>John:</strong> “You see, the point is now – George – is we both did that to George, this time”</p>\n<p><strong>Paul:</strong> “Mm”</p>\n<p><strong>John:</strong> “And because of the build up to it, that – now he can’t even take that”</p>\n<p><strong>Paul:</strong> “Treating him a bit like a mongrel, yeah”</p>\n<p><strong>John:</strong> “He can’t even – you know. It’s like if I say, ‘Alright, take it,’ he’ll say, ‘Well, look, I can’t take it. I’ll forget it.’”</p>\n<p><strong>Paul:</strong> “Yeah…”</p>\n<p><strong>John:</strong> “I have to, uh—”</p>\n<p><strong>Paul:</strong> “‘Cause he knows what we’re all about”</p>\n<p><strong>John:</strong> “Yeah”</p>\n<p><strong>Paul:</strong> “So he knows that when we say, ‘Take it,’ we expect doo-doo-duh-duh-doo. If I said that, then you’d expect—”</p>\n<p><strong>John:</strong> “But it’s just that bit.

John and Paul interview each other about non-existent projects, skirt issue of John's health, communicate in alternations of absurdity and obscurity. (Doug Sulpy describes tone of John's voice as having \"interesting quality [...] as if, wanting to say something serious for a change, he's forgotten quite how\".)\r\n\r\n**John:** \"Who's the fool on the hill, Paul?\"\r\n\r\n**Paul:** \"John\"\r\n\r\n**John:** [long pause] \"I'm trying to sell the house\" [long pause] \"When I was young, so much younger than today, I never needed anybody's help, in any way.

Wondered why I had so many bedrooms\"\r\n\r\n**Paul:** [long pause] \"Were you able to tell them?\"\r\n\r\n**John:** \"Oh, yeah. I told them I've got a lot of bedrooms because I've got too many. And I offered them accommodation in Ireland, which they took up\"\r\n\r\n**Paul:** [long pause] \"Let's crack on\" [sighs]\r\n\r\n**Michael:** \"Who's got a match, as opposed to a lighter?\"\r\n\r\n**Paul:** \"I have\"\r\n\r\n**John:** \"I have\"\r\n\r\n**Michael:** \"As opposed to a lighter\"\r\n\r\n**Ringo:** \"A wooden one?\"\r\n\r\n**Paul:** \"Blue gold?\"\r\n\r\n**Michael:** \"A wooden one do, a wooden one not do… thank you\"\r\n\r\n**Paul:** \"I wooden wanna…\"\r\n\r\n**Michael:** \"Are you [inaudible] John?\"\r\n\r\n**Glyn:** [laughs] \"No, I am not related\"\r\n\r\n**Ringo:** \"Stratford John?\"\r\n\r\n**Glyn:** \"Nope\"\r\n\r\n**Paul:** \"Farmer John?\"\r\n\r\n**Glyn:** \"Augustus John, apparently\"\r\n\r\n**Michael:** \"The John\"\r\n\r\n**Glyn:** \"Rumour has it Augustus John is a grandfather twice removed or something\" [laughs]\r\n\r\n**Michael:** \"That's the way with most of us offspring [inaudible]\"\r\n\r\n**Paul:** [referring to film equipment] \"Is that the new trick, the playback speed is up there?\"\r\n\r\n**Ringo:** \"They've been there for several years\"\r\n\r\n**Paul:** \"Still feeding back\" [laughs]\r\n\r\n**Michael:** \"Should we knock off early today or not?\"\r\n\r\n**Paul:** \"Probably, yeah\"\r\n\r\n**Michael:** \"Should we knock on early tomorrow?\"\r\n\r\n**John:** \"Yes, I'll do that\"\r\n\r\n**Paul:** \"Knock on early?\"\r\n\r\n**John:** \"Yes, I just uh… was up late, you know\"\r\n\r\n**Paul:** \"Yeah?\"\r\n\r\n**Michael:** \"At the moment you're a guest for lunch\"\r\n\r\n**John:** \"I was sort of stoned and high and watching films and I wouldn't have made it anyway.

I am an innovator in many ways\"\r\n\r\n**John:** \"Well, apart from your part-time work, what are you doing?\"\r\n\r\n**Paul:** \"Well, I do a lot of dramatic work, in and out of the country\"\r\n\r\n**John:** \"Presently, I'm working on a Welsh TV series called Land for Wecken, in which I appear as a Danish singer of royal blood who turned to folk singing after a disaster in the First World War where the Nazis bombed his house\"\r\n\r\n**Paul:** \"Mm\"\r\n\r\n**John:** \"And he had to move into, uh, Norway I think it was.

It was our plan\"\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n#### Conversation 2: Two Virgins Discussion & Ringo Feeling Ill\r\n\r\n**Context:** From 'a moral to this song' blog - As day trudges forth without productivity for Beatles' second day without George, Paul asks John about Two Virgins (under flippant guise of journalist) to which John responds with stiff sincerity. Michael Lindsay-Hogg comes round to confer, Ringo admits he isn't feeling well and wonders about having rest. Michael commiserates but expresses concern about impetus of group, worried they will individually (and indifferently) wander off to own devices if they don't have routine schedule to solder them together as working band - prompts John and Ringo to sing sentimental folk bar. Not being of disposition to have serious discussions about direction of sessions, John, Paul, and Ringo (dis)engage in frivolous wit and references to Laugh-In.\r\n\r\n**Paul:** \"So what's the point behind Two Virgins?\" [Yoko laughs]\r\n\r\n**John:** \"It's a six-inch nail\" [long pause] \"The main point behind it is to open people's minds to what's happening today. There are people all over the country humming into tape recorders, and we hope to bring them out into the open. And hum together\" [pause] \"You understand?\"\r\n\r\n**Paul:** \"Hmm\"\r\n\r\n**John:** \"Now sold one thousand three hundred due to the great promotion from Apple Dietetics\"\r\n\r\n**Yoko:** [laughs] \"Which is a figure you don't want to expose, necessarily\"\r\n\r\n**Paul:** \"Is it very neat to do this in public, Mr. Lennon?\"\r\n\r\n**John:** \"I feel obliged, in the position that I am today as a pop idol and the power I have, to do something for the good, and uh, I feel obliged to speak out…\" [pause] \"And that's as simple as I can put it, really. Take Downing Street. South Orderly Street. Wimpole Street. All owned by the Queen. 'Nuff said\" [silence; fidgeting]\r\n\r\n**Mal:** [in background] \"Is anybody – wanna rehearse, or do songs, or—?\"\r\n\r\n**Yoko:** [inaudible]\r\n\r\n**Ringo:** \"I feel ill, actually\"\r\n\r\n**Michael:** \"Do you? Was this a mistake [inaudible]?\"\r\n\r\n**Ringo:** \"I don't\" [laughter]\r\n\r\n**John:** \"I think a few days in bed…\"\r\n\r\n**Ringo:** \"Yes, I think so too\"\r\n\r\n**John:** \"Or maybe three days on the couch, depending on what your job is\"\r\n\r\n**Ringo:** \"I think two days in bed\"\r\n\r\n**Michael:** \"Do you really not feel well?\"\r\n\r\n**Ringo:** \"No, I just feel a bit… ill\"\r\n\r\n**Paul:** [to Michael] \"Well, do you?\"\r\n\r\n**Michael:** \"I don't feel well, but I can't say, 'cause I'm the captain of the ship\"\r\n\r\n**John:** \"Oh you can\" [Yoko laughs]\r\n\r\n**Paul:** \"Why?\"\r\n\r\n**Michael:** \"No, I don't want to let the crew down\"\r\n\r\n**John:** \"Nowadays, the captain gets off first\"\r\n\r\n**Michael:** \"No, I go down with the ship\"\r\n\r\n**Yoko:** [inaudible]\r\n\r\n**John:** \"No he does, really\"\r\n\r\n**Michael:** \"I feel tired, but I think it's tiring – disappointing\"\r\n\r\n**John:** [bored] \"Hmm\"\r\n\r\n**Michael:** \"But I have a feeling if we decide not to meet one day, we may never meet again\"\r\n\r\n**Paul:** \"Well…\"\r\n\r\n**John:** \"Along this dusty road…\"\r\n\r\n**Ringo:** \"We'll always meet again…\"\r\n\r\n**John:** \"On this dusty road\"\r\n\r\n**Yoko:** \"As they say, there's no business like no business\"\r\n\r\n**John:** \"Again\"\r\n\r\n**Paul:** \"Yeah\"\r\n\r\n**Yoko:** \"Again\"\r\n\r\n**Paul:** \"And still the boom [mic] wasn't over them\"\r\n\r\n**John:** \"Ooh, the Queen of Sheba wore falsies\"\r\n\r\n**Ringo:** [mock-surprise] \"I didn't know that!\"\r\n\r\n**John:** \"Didn't you know that? You weren't there at the time\" [pause] \"Cleopatra was a carpet manufacturer\"\r\n\r\n**Ringo:** \"I didn't know that!\"\r\n\r\n**John:** \"'Cause you weren't there at the time\" [pause] \"Edgar Allen Poe was a shithouse\"\r\n\r\n**Ringo:** \"I didn't know that!\"\r\n\r\n**Yoko:** \"What was John Lennon?\"\r\n\r\n**John:** \"A patriot\" [Yoko laughs] \"I didn't know that\" [laughter]\r\n\r\n**John & Paul:** \"Goodnight, Dick\" [laughter]\r\n\r\n**John:** [sighs] \"That was Lennon and McCartney. Northern Sheds. Great Western Railway\"\r\n\r\n**Paul:** \"Songs for all functions\"\r\n\r\n**John:** \"Ross-Upon-Wye\"\r\n\r\n**Paul:** \"Nige-Whalley-Mange\"\r\n\r\n**John:** \"Ilford two, Western Middlodeons – terrible\"\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n#### Conversation 3: CBC Interview, Work Discussion & Bad Jokes\r\n\r\n**Context:** From 'a moral to this song' blog - As Paul jokingly suggests camera crew capture Ringo (who isn't feeling well) if he sicks on floor, John mentions superficially that he threw up during interview filmed earlier in day with Yoko for Canadian television – not from illness, but from recent irresponsible habits, possibly exercised previous night. Paul, wearied by lethargy of proceedings, tries to engage John about recording sessions and how they should work while George is gone, but John palters, and at turns they both fall back on oblique references and emotionally indeterminate allusions. After John trades bad jokes with Ringo, Paul implores them to remember why they're here and that they can't idle forever, and John (seemingly contrite, if nonetheless facile) agrees to start rehearsing. Despite others' reservations about his health, subdued Ringo reassures he's staying to play too.\r\n\r\n**Note:** During this period John was using heroin, which is most probable cause (directly or indirectly) for his vomiting.\r\n\r\n**Ringo:** \"Kevin?\"\r\n\r\n**Paul:** \"I think if we hang around a bit longer we can get Ringo being sick\" [laughter]\r\n\r\n**John:** \"You – see, you missed me this morning, I did it for CBS. Just leapt off in the middle of the interview\"\r\n\r\n**Paul:** \"Did you?\"\r\n\r\n**Kevin:** [in background] \"As a matter of fact, yes\"\r\n\r\n**John:** \"No reason at all, except that I've been mistreating my body\"\r\n\r\n**Yoko:** \"I thought it was a happening\"\r\n\r\n**John:** \"It was a happening\"\r\n\r\n**Paul:** \"There was a lot of nervous tension, you know\"\r\n\r\n**John:** \"Oh, yes\"\r\n\r\n**Paul:** \"I mean, there was a bloody funny atmosphere in that room, mother\"\r\n\r\n**John:** \"Aye\"\r\n\r\n**Michael:** \"We missed out on the other day\"\r\n\r\n**John:** \"Hmm?\"\r\n\r\n**Michael:** \"We missed it the other day, but then they wouldn't let us have it\"\r\n\r\n**John:** \"They missed it too\"\r\n\r\n**Michael:** \"Oh. Were they in colour or black and white?\"\r\n\r\n**Yoko:** \"Colour\"\r\n\r\n**John:** \"I never noticed that. Colour\"\r\n\r\n**Paul:** [trying] \"See, what we need is a serious program of work. An endeavour. Not an aimless rambling amongst the canyons of your mind. [inaudible] —life\"\r\n\r\n**John:** \"Take me on that trip upon that golden ship of shores… We're all together, boy\"\r\n\r\n**Paul:** \"To wander aimlessly is very unswinging. Unhip\"\r\n\r\n**John:** \"And when I touch you, I feel happy inside. I can't hide, I can't hide\" [pause] \"Ask me why, I'll say I love you\"\r\n\r\n**Paul:** \"What we need is a schedule\"\r\n\r\n**John:** \"A garden schedule\"\r\n\r\n**Paul:** \"Point A to Z. Travel to A to Z, and having reached the point – take a holiday\"\r\n\r\n**John:** \"It's holiday time\"\r\n\r\n**Paul:** \"Achieve something, everyday\" [pause]\r\n\r\n**Yoko:** \"It's a hell of a lot to ask for…\"\r\n\r\n**John:** \"That's sort of hard to live up to, Paul\"\r\n\r\n**Paul:** [very quiet] \"It's very hard to live up to\"\r\n\r\n**Michael:** \"Ernest Hemingway had a very good remark about that, which I've unfortunately forgotten. About achieving something everyday. It's the only thing of his writings I like\"\r\n\r\n**Paul:** \"It may in theory sound silly, but—\"\r\n\r\n**John:** \"In practice…\"\r\n\r\n**Paul:** \"—it's even sillier. Well, if practice is all there is\"\r\n\r\n**John:** \"This is where it's at\"\r\n\r\n**Paul:** \"This is where it's at, unless that is where it's at\"\r\n\r\n**John:** \"This is where it's at, now\"\r\n\r\n**Paul:** \"Mm-hmm\" [long pause] \"Teamwork. A good defense. And a line of forwards. A good strong pair of boots\"\r\n\r\n**Yoko:** [inaudible]\r\n\r\n**John:** \"You play ball with me, and I'll play ball with you\"\r\n\r\n**Paul:** \"Don't swing the lead, sonny\"\r\n\r\n**John:** \"Every cloud have a silver mouth boat\"\r\n\r\n**Paul:** \"Could be learning something instead of this, you know\"\r\n\r\n**John:** \"Bob Newridges is a tartan that covers Yorkshire\"\r\n\r\n**Paul:** \"Rutland is the smallest county\"\r\n\r\n**John:** \"Scarborough is a college scarf\"\r\n\r\n**Paul:** \"Amo amas a minge\"\r\n\r\n**John:** [laughs] \"Amanty meaty monkey monk…\" [Paul laughs]\r\n\r\n**Yoko:** [to Michael] \"Are we going to see the rushes, or—?\"\r\n\r\n**Paul:** \"This is the – this is the typical end-product of an actor's career\"\r\n\r\n**John:** \"Alexander the Great was a bighead. Or a fireplace\" [long pause] \"Why do they call it Great Britain? How long is it going to go on? Fantastic France. Amazing America\"\r\n\r\n**Paul:** \"Huge Spain\"\r\n\r\n**John:** [laughs] \"Huge Spain. I'll drink to that\" [pause] \"When is a door not a door?\"\r\n\r\n**Ringo:** \"I don't know\"\r\n\r\n**John:** \"When it's ajar\"\r\n\r\n**Paul:** \"When it's ajar\"\r\n\r\n**Ringo:** \"Two flies on a door.

John and Paul interview each other about non-existent projects, skirt issue of John’s health, communicate in alternations of absurdity and obscurity. (Doug Sulpy describes tone of John’s voice as having “interesting quality […] as if, wanting to say something serious for a change, he’s forgotten quite how”.)</p>\n<p><strong>John:</strong> “Who’s the fool on the hill, Paul?”</p>\n<p><strong>Paul:</strong> “John”</p>\n<p><strong>John:</strong> [long pause] “I’m trying to sell the house” [long pause] “When I was young, so much younger than today, I never needed anybody’s help, in any way.

Michael Lindsay-Hogg comes round to confer, Ringo admits he isn’t feeling well and wonders about having rest. Michael commiserates but expresses concern about impetus of group, worried they will individually (and indifferently) wander off to own devices if they don’t have routine schedule to solder them together as working band - prompts John and Ringo to sing sentimental folk bar. Not being of disposition to have serious discussions about direction of sessions, John, Paul, and Ringo (dis)engage in frivolous wit and references to Laugh-In.</p>\n<p><strong>Paul:</strong> “So what’s the point behind Two Virgins?” [Yoko laughs]</p>\n<p><strong>John:</strong> “It’s a six-inch nail” [long pause] “The main point behind it is to open people’s minds to what’s happening today. There are people all over the country humming into tape recorders, and we hope to bring them out into the open. And hum together” [pause] “You understand?”</p>\n<p><strong>Paul:</strong> “Hmm”</p>\n<p><strong>John:</strong> “Now sold one thousand three hundred due to the great promotion from Apple Dietetics”</p>\n<p><strong>Yoko:</strong> [laughs] “Which is a figure you don’t want to expose, necessarily”</p>\n<p><strong>Paul:</strong> “Is it very neat to do this in public, Mr. Lennon?”</p>\n<p><strong>John:</strong> “I feel obliged, in the position that I am today as a pop idol and the power I have, to do something for the good, and uh, I feel obliged to speak out…” [pause] “And that’s as simple as I can put it, really.

Paul, wearied by lethargy of proceedings, tries to engage John about recording sessions and how they should work while George is gone, but John palters, and at turns they both fall back on oblique references and emotionally indeterminate allusions. After John trades bad jokes with Ringo, Paul implores them to remember why they’re here and that they can’t idle forever, and John (seemingly contrite, if nonetheless facile) agrees to start rehearsing. Despite others’ reservations about his health, subdued Ringo reassures he’s staying to play too.</p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> During this period John was using heroin, which is most probable cause (directly or indirectly) for his vomiting.</p>\n<p><strong>Ringo:</strong> “Kevin?”</p>\n<p><strong>Paul:</strong> “I think if we hang around a bit longer we can get Ringo being sick” [laughter]</p>\n<p><strong>John:</strong> “You – see, you missed me this morning, I did it for CBS.

Were they in colour or black and white?”</p>\n<p><strong>Yoko:</strong> “Colour”</p>\n<p><strong>John:</strong> “I never noticed that. Colour”</p>\n<p><strong>Paul:</strong> [trying] “See, what we need is a serious program of work. An endeavour. Not an aimless rambling amongst the canyons of your mind. [inaudible] —life”</p>\n<p><strong>John:</strong> “Take me on that trip upon that golden ship of shores… We’re all together, boy”</p>\n<p><strong>Paul:</strong> “To wander aimlessly is very unswinging. Unhip”</p>\n<p><strong>John:</strong> “And when I touch you, I feel happy inside. I can’t hide, I can’t hide” [pause] “Ask me why, I’ll say I love you”</p>\n<p><strong>Paul:</strong> “What we need is a schedule”</p>\n<p><strong>John:</strong> “A garden schedule”</p>\n<p><strong>Paul:</strong> “Point A to Z. Travel to A to Z, and having reached the point – take a holiday”</p>\n<p><strong>John:</strong> “It’s holiday time”</p>\n<p><strong>Paul:</strong> “Achieve something, everyday” [pause]</p>\n<p><strong>Yoko:</strong> “It’s a hell of a lot to ask for…”</p>\n<p><strong>John:</strong> “That’s sort of hard to live up to, Paul”</p>\n<p><strong>Paul:</strong> [very quiet] “It’s very hard to live up to”</p>\n<p><strong>Michael:</strong> “Ernest Hemingway had a very good remark about that, which I’ve unfortunately forgotten. About achieving something everyday. It’s the only thing of his writings I like”</p>\n<p><strong>Paul:</strong> “It may in theory sound silly, but—”</p>\n<p><strong>John:</strong> “In practice…”</p>\n<p><strong>Paul:</strong> “—it’s even sillier. Well, if practice is all there is”</p>\n<p><strong>John:</strong> “This is where it’s at”</p>\n<p><strong>Paul:</strong> “This is where it’s at, unless that is where it’s at”</p>\n<p><strong>John:</strong> “This is where it’s at, now”</p>\n<p><strong>Paul:</strong> “Mm-hmm” [long pause] “Teamwork.

Or a fireplace” [long pause] “Why do they call it Great Britain? How long is it going to go on? Fantastic France. Amazing America”</p>\n<p><strong>Paul:</strong> “Huge Spain”</p>\n<p><strong>John:</strong> [laughs] “Huge Spain. I’ll drink to that” [pause] “When is a door not a door?”</p>\n<p><strong>Ringo:</strong> “I don’t know”</p>\n<p><strong>John:</strong> “When it’s ajar”</p>\n<p><strong>Paul:</strong> “When it’s ajar”</p>\n<p><strong>Ringo:</strong> “Two flies on a door.

Allen Klein met with other Beatles following day (January 28).\r\n\r\n### Context Leading to Meeting\r\n\r\n**January 13, 1969:** Interview of John published in Disc & Music Echo by Ray Coleman\r\n- Shed light on brewing financial troubles at Apple Corps for first time\r\n- What started as Beatles' utopian vision for creative haven spiraling into chaotic business operation\r\n- Plagued by mismanagement and mounting losses\r\n\r\n**Around January 12, 1969:** Beatles signed document\r\n- Authorizing law firm Eastman & Eastman to negotiate contracts on their behalf\r\n- Firm led by Lee Eastman (father of Linda Eastman, Paul's future wife)\r\n- Linda's brother John Eastman serving as partner\r\n\r\n**John Eastman's actions:**\r\n- Shortly after involvement began, explored possibility of purchasing NEMS Enterprises\r\n- Company once helmed by Brian Epstein (Beatles' former manager)\r\n\r\n**Other Beatles' unease:**\r\n- Idea of entrusting Apple's affairs to Paul's future in-laws caused unease\r\n\r\n**Derek Taylor's role:**\r\n- Beatles' press officer passed John Lennon's phone number to Allen Klein\r\n\r\n### Allen Klein Background\r\n\r\n**Reputation:**\r\n- Controversial and ambitious American businessman\r\n- Built reputation for securing lucrative deals\r\n- Earned both praise and criticism during tenure as Rolling Stones' business manager\r\n\r\n**Previous Beatles approach:**\r\n- First approached Beatles December 1967\r\n- Attempted to position himself as their manager\r\n- Now with Apple Corps in disarray, saw another opportunity\r\n\r\n### Derek Taylor on Klein\r\n\r\n**Ken McNab 'And in the End' (2020):**\r\n\"Klein is essential in the Great Novel as the Demon King. Just as you think everything's going to be all right, here he is. I helped to bring him to Apple, but I did give The Beatles certain solemn warnings\"\r\n\r\n**Peter Doggett 'You Never Give Me Your Money' (2010):**\r\n\"I brought him to Apple, but I did give the Beatles certain solemn warnings. I told them to ask around, and said that he had various reputations, that he might get them a good financial deal, but might not be someone you would want to take home to your mother\"\r\n\r\n### Allen Klein's Motivation\r\n\r\n**Keith Badman 'Off the Record' (2008):**\r\n\"I went straight to Lennon when he said they were going broke. I wanted to find out first if he realised the position he was in. John had made a public statement about the financial problems that Apple had and, from the statement, I was aware of what I had been already aware of. So, I called him and asked if I could help\"\r\n\r\n### The Meeting\r\n\r\n**Location:** Dorchester Hotel, London\r\n\r\n**After:** Day 18 studio session working on Get Back\r\n\r\n**Attendees:** John Lennon, Yoko Ono, Allen Klein\r\n\r\n**Klein's preparation:**\r\n- Came armed with charm, persuasive demeanor, and deep understanding of music industry\r\n\r\n**John and Yoko's reaction:** Thoroughly impressed\r\n\r\n**John's pivotal decision:** In that very meeting, chose Klein to be his personal manager\r\n\r\n**That night:** John wrote to Sir Joseph Lockwood, Chairman of EMI, to let him know decision\r\n\r\n### Klein's Account of Meeting\r\n\r\n**Ken McNab 'And in the End' (2020):**\r\n\"I didn't propose anything, I don't work that way. I just asked him 'How can I help you?' That's all, and after we broke the ice, it was a very personal sort of meeting. We were trying to get to know each other. He was scared to death about the money situation.

Klein. Allen Klein\"\r\n\r\n**George Harrison:** \"Oh, I see\"\r\n\r\n**John Lennon:** \"Yeah. And it's… You know, it's very interesting. You know, from a lot of angles.

A lot of interesting news that we don't know half about, just about…\"\r\n\r\n**George Harrison:** \"About us?\"\r\n\r\n**John Lennon:** \"Well, I'll tell– You know, he'll tell you all that, 'cause it's… You know, he knows everything about everything. Very interesting guy. I was there till 2:00 in the morning\"\r\n\r\n**George Harrison:** \"Oh, you went last night?\"\r\n\r\n**John Lennon:** \"I went there thinking, 'Well, I've got to see him. I put it off last time.' You know? I keep hearing about him all these years. Things that you just… you can't believe, you know. Right down to where… where it's gone, and how to get it. So, I, you know… Well, I didn't really wanna say it to sort of half o'ya. I thought, 'He's gonna look after me, whatever.' That's… it's just like that. And he knows… He even knows what we're like, you know? The way he described each one of us, you know, and what we've done, and what we're gonna do and that. But just, like, he knows me as much as you do. Incredible guy. And he's got a great idea for Biafra. He's like – He says, 'I'm a practical man.' And his thing… You know The Stones' Circus we did? So he arranges those things for them\"\r\n\r\n**George Harrison:** \"Yeah\"\r\n\r\n**John Lennon:** \"All we heard about that and the royalty from way back… They get much more than us. However many we sell, they cop. You know, so, The Stones show, he's gonna make an LP out of it. They're making a book of it and everything, of course, you know? Like, everybody is into that. And he's gonna, uh, make an LP of it, of everybody that was on… to buy food for Biafra. Yeah, I was telling him about your idea for that film\"\r\n\r\n**George Harrison:** \"Oh, yeah\"\r\n\r\n**John Lennon:** \"The thing is, I mean, if we took the food to that place, with the money we've all earned… He'd do it completely himself, arrange it all.

So, somebody says he's this or that, you know…' But he… fuckin' hell, he knows about Isherwood [Beatles accountant], Bahamas [base of some Beatles finances], Strach [Beatles accountant]… Things that you can't believe, you know. The same old news, but right down to where: where it's gone, and how to get it. So I didn't really want to say it. I said, 'He's going to look after me whatever,' you know. It's just like that. And he knows, he even knowns what we're like, you know, just from the pick-up. I mean, he said he had to see me to know exactly if he was right or not. But the way he described each one of us, you know, and what we'd done and what we're going to do, and that… but just like, you know, I know you, he knows me as much as you do. Incredible guy. We [John and Yoko] were both just stunned.

The following month (January 1969) I telephoned Mr. Lennon from the United States and arranged to meet him in London. This meeting took place at the Dorchester Hotel on 27th January 1969. At that time The Beatles and their company, Apple Corps Limited ('Apple') had issued a general retainer to one John Eastman to negotiate contracts for them throughout the world. Although that retainer was terminable at any time, Mr. Lennon told me that this was the arrangement and he only asked me at this stage to look after the personal affairs of himself and his wife.\r\n\r\nSince I was to look after Mr. Lennon's affairs one matter of immediate urgency was the proposed acquisition by Apple, then under consideration, of Nemperor Holdings Limited, previously called NEMS Enterprises Limited ('NEMS'). I arranged to meet the other three Beatles with Mr. Lennon the following evening. NEMS was the company owned as to 90% by the estate of Brian Epstein (The Beatles' former Manager) or his family interests, while each of The Beatles individually owned a 21/2% interest. NEMS had acted as the management company for The Beatles from 1962 to about 1967. It and its associated companies held continuing interests in perpetuity in contracts entered into by The Beatles and in the products of their services throughout this period. Some of these rights were of great continuing value, notwithstanding that the management agreement had come to an end. In particular there was a recording agreement dated 26th January 1967 between The Beatles and Electrical & Musical Industries Limited ('EMI') which did not expire until 1967 and in which NEMS had a 25% interest. At my first meeting with Mr. Lennon mentioned above, he told me that John Eastman had proposed to The Beatles that they should purchase the Epstein interests in NEMS and that the deal was about to be put through finance having been arranged through EMI by means of an advance of £ 1 million against future royalties\"\r\n\r\n### Outcome\r\n\r\n**Immediate:** John chose Klein as personal manager that night, wrote to EMI Chairman\r\n\r\n**Following day (January 28):** Klein met with other Beatles\r\n\r\n**Long-term impact:** Klein vs. Eastmans conflict became major factor in Beatles' eventual breakup","src/content/research/get-back-dialogue-day-to-day/mccartney-website/jan-27-klein-meeting-overview.md","c2a417392b9696fe",{html:5553,metadata:5554},"<h2 id=\"january-27-1969-allen-klein-meets-john-lennon\">January 27, 1969: Allen Klein Meets John Lennon</h2>\n<p>Evening meeting at Dorchester Hotel, London, where John Lennon chose Allen Klein as personal manager.

I informed them that for my part I could not recommend Mr Lennon to proceed with the purchase while (as was the fact) the relevant information about the position of The Beatles (and their companies) themselves remained to be ascertained. The Plaintiff said that the proposal was strongly recommended by John Eastman and he (the Plaintiff) was pressing it. I therefore suggested that there was no point in debating the matter in the abscence of John Eastman and it was agreed that we have another meeting on Saturday 1st February, with John Eastman present.\r\n\r\nDuring the meeting on 28th January I said that I was going to make enquiries into Mr. Lennon's financial position. Mr Starkey and Mr Harrison asked me to do the same for them. (At this stage the Plaintiff had left the meeting) I spent the remainder of that week largely in the offices of Bryce Hammer & Co, chartered accountants, (who were The Beatles' personal accountants) with Mr Harry Pinsker, a partner in that firm, obtaining the information that I required. By the end of the week I had a reasonable amount of information about the personal position of The Beatles but, as I had not had time to make a full investigation into the affairs of their companies, I was not really in a position to assess their true financial position overall\"\r\n\r\n### John Lennon's Defense of Klein\r\n\r\n**From 'Lennon Remembers' by Jann S.

And of course I promoted him in the — in the fashion of which I will — you see me promoting something, or talking about something. I was enthusiastic about him and I was relieved because I met a lot of people including Lord Beeching, who's one of the top people in Britain and all that. And though he didn't want to take the job, Paul had told me, 'Go and see Lord Beeching.' So I went. I mean I'm a good boy, man.

How can you be so uncool? We are meeting this great guy and you are going home.' I thought, 'He's a businessman, and you don't do business past nine o'clock at night, do you?' The crunch was when we came to discuss percentages. I thought, 'We are big stars now, and Brian Epstein asked twenty per cent in the beginning.' I even argued with him then. I said, 'Twenty? I thought that managers only took ten per cent?' He said, 'No, it's twenty these days.' So, I said, 'Okay, maybe I'm not very modern.' But, we were pretty unknown in those days and Klein asked for the same. I said to the others, 'He'll do it for five. We are big boys now.' Well, I thought we had had a bit of success. So, there would be John, George and Ringo with Klein and there would be me. I would be saying, 'Listen, Allen, you said that that was going to happen. Where is it now?'

I informed them that for my part I could not recommend Mr Lennon to proceed with the purchase while (as was the fact) the relevant information about the position of The Beatles (and their companies) themselves remained to be ascertained. The Plaintiff said that the proposal was strongly recommended by John Eastman and he (the Plaintiff) was pressing it. I therefore suggested that there was no point in debating the matter in the abscence of John Eastman and it was agreed that we have another meeting on Saturday 1st February, with John Eastman present.</p>\n<p>During the meeting on 28th January I said that I was going to make enquiries into Mr. Lennon’s financial position. Mr Starkey and Mr Harrison asked me to do the same for them. (At this stage the Plaintiff had left the meeting) I spent the remainder of that week largely in the offices of Bryce Hammer &#x26; Co, chartered accountants, (who were The Beatles’ personal accountants) with Mr Harry Pinsker, a partner in that firm, obtaining the information that I required. By the end of the week I had a reasonable amount of information about the personal position of The Beatles but, as I had not had time to make a full investigation into the affairs of their companies, I was not really in a position to assess their true financial position overall”</p>\n<h3 id=\"john-lennons-defense-of-klein\">John Lennon’s Defense of Klein</h3>\n<p><strong>From ‘Lennon Remembers’ by Jann S.

They're on top of the world but isolated, performing for whoever happens to hear rather than a paying audience, and knowing it can't last.\r\n\r\n## Historical Context\r\n\r\nOn January 25, 1969, Michael Lindsay-Hogg and Glyn Johns proposed the rooftop concert after Ringo showed them the view from the roof. Paul McCartney, frustrated by the lack of a climax for the film, immediately embraced the idea.\r\n\r\nThe concert took place on January 30, 1969, at approximately 12:30 PM.

The focus is entirely on the art, which makes the vibrant, famous personalities who frequent the space stand out even more.\r\n\r\nFor the \"You Are Here\" exhibition in July 1968, the centerpiece is a vast, circular white canvas, with only the tiny words \"you are here\" at its center.

This is *the* place to be seen. There's a low hum of intellectual conversation mixed with the palpable energy of rock stars and socialites.

He feels increasingly suffocated by the Lennon-McCartney songwriting dynasty, viewing his own sophisticated compositions as perpetually sidelined. He isn't seeking fame or political power; he is seeking genuine enlightenment and a creative outlet that The Beatles can no longer provide. This makes him profoundly receptive to any path that offers an alternative to the band's escalating psychodrama.\r\n\r\n## Internal Conflict\r\n\r\nGeorge is torn between his lingering loyalty to the band that made him and his growing conviction that his true path lies elsewhere. Part of him still wants to fight for his place, to get another song on the album. But another, stronger part is tired of the ego battles and yearns to simply transcend the whole mess. This internal ambivalence is the crack that MI5 agent Nigel Finch expertly widens.\r\n\r\n## Character Arc\r\n\r\n**Act 1 (1965): The Overlooked Beatle** - At the MBE ceremony, George is visibly uncomfortable with the pomp and circumstance. He's already feeling creatively stifled by the Lennon-McCartney dominance, making dry observations about the absurdity of their situation. His quiet resentment simmers beneath the surface.\r\n\r\n**Act 2 (1966-1968): The Manipulated Seeker** - During Operation Minuet, George becomes Nigel Finch's primary target. In 1967, Nigel (as a bookshop owner) \"guides\" George toward Eastern philosophy through a carefully placed sitar instruction book. George, hungry for creative and spiritual validation, embraces this path wholeheartedly. His growing detachment from band tensions serves MI5's goals perfectly - he becomes less invested in keeping The Beatles together.\r\n\r\n**Act 3 (1969-1970): The Liberated Artist** - By the time John returns his MBE and the band fractures, George views it as cosmic justice rather than tragedy. The failed assassination attempt passes him by entirely - he's already mentally moved on. In the epilogue, he's found peace in his post-Beatles life, never knowing his spiritual journey was partially orchestrated by British intelligence.\r\n\r\n## Psychological Profile\r\n\r\n**Core Traits:**\r\n\r\n- Introverted and observant\r\n- Prone to quiet brooding and dry, cynical wit\r\n- Deeply principled and spiritually curious\r\n- Holds grudges when he feels slighted or disrespected\r\n\r\n**Vulnerabilities:**\r\n\r\n- His profound feeling of being undervalued.\r\n- His earnest search for meaning makes him susceptible to anyone who appears to take his spiritual quest seriously.\r\n\r\n## Key Relationships\r\n\r\n### John & Paul\r\n\r\nThe \"bosses.\" He loves them like brothers but resents them as creative gatekeepers. Their dynamic is the primary source of his frustration and his main reason for seeking an escape.\r\n\r\n### Nigel Finch (The Bookshop \"Sage\")\r\n\r\nIn 1967, George encounters Nigel disguised as a wise, spiritual bookshop owner who seems to understand his creative frustrations and spiritual yearning. Nigel carefully guides George toward the sitar and Eastern philosophy, appearing as a mentor figure who validates George's quest for meaning beyond The Beatles. George has no idea this kindly guide is an MI5 agent executing Operation Minuet.

Already feeling like the \"junior\" member, he's uncomfortable with the royal ceremony's formality and begins questioning the band's direction.\r\n\r\n**1966:** During the \"Jesus\" controversy (amplified by Clive Barrow), George starts to see the band's fame as spiritually hollow. His interest in Indian music, which began in 1965, deepens as an escape from the chaos.\r\n\r\n**1967:** The pivotal year - Nigel Finch, posing as a bookshop owner, \"guides\" George toward a sitar instruction book and Eastern philosophy texts. George interprets this as spiritual destiny, not knowing it's part of Operation Minuet. His growing detachment from band dynamics serves MI5's fracturing goals.\r\n\r\n**1968:** George participates in the Maharishi trip (subtly funded by the Committee), further deepening his spiritual practice and emotional distance from Beatles politics. He becomes increasingly philosophical about the band's tensions.\r\n\r\n**1969:** When John returns his MBE in November, George sees it as John's spiritual awakening rather than political protest.

He feels increasingly suffocated by the Lennon-McCartney songwriting dynasty, viewing his own sophisticated compositions as perpetually sidelined. He isn’t seeking fame or political power; he is seeking genuine enlightenment and a creative outlet that The Beatles can no longer provide. This makes him profoundly receptive to any path that offers an alternative to the band’s escalating psychodrama.</p>\n<h2 id=\"internal-conflict\">Internal Conflict</h2>\n<p>George is torn between his lingering loyalty to the band that made him and his growing conviction that his true path lies elsewhere. Part of him still wants to fight for his place, to get another song on the album. But another, stronger part is tired of the ego battles and yearns to simply transcend the whole mess. This internal ambivalence is the crack that MI5 agent Nigel Finch expertly widens.</p>\n<h2 id=\"character-arc\">Character Arc</h2>\n<p><strong>Act 1 (1965): The Overlooked Beatle</strong> - At the MBE ceremony, George is visibly uncomfortable with the pomp and circumstance. He’s already feeling creatively stifled by the Lennon-McCartney dominance, making dry observations about the absurdity of their situation. His quiet resentment simmers beneath the surface.</p>\n<p><strong>Act 2 (1966-1968): The Manipulated Seeker</strong> - During Operation Minuet, George becomes Nigel Finch’s primary target. In 1967, Nigel (as a bookshop owner) “guides” George toward Eastern philosophy through a carefully placed sitar instruction book. George, hungry for creative and spiritual validation, embraces this path wholeheartedly. His growing detachment from band tensions serves MI5’s goals perfectly - he becomes less invested in keeping The Beatles together.</p>\n<p><strong>Act 3 (1969-1970): The Liberated Artist</strong> - By the time John returns his MBE and the band fractures, George views it as cosmic justice rather than tragedy. The failed assassination attempt passes him by entirely - he’s already mentally moved on. In the epilogue, he’s found peace in his post-Beatles life, never knowing his spiritual journey was partially orchestrated by British intelligence.</p>\n<h2 id=\"psychological-profile\">Psychological Profile</h2>\n<p><strong>Core Traits:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Introverted and observant</li>\n<li>Prone to quiet brooding and dry, cynical wit</li>\n<li>Deeply principled and spiritually curious</li>\n<li>Holds grudges when he feels slighted or disrespected</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Vulnerabilities:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>His profound feeling of being undervalued.</li>\n<li>His earnest search for meaning makes him susceptible to anyone who appears to take his spiritual quest seriously.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"key-relationships\">Key Relationships</h2>\n<h3 id=\"john--paul\">John &#x26; Paul</h3>\n<p>The “bosses.” He loves them like brothers but resents them as creative gatekeepers.

His casual irreverence at the 1965 MBE ceremony - the \"killing people\" quip - isn't calculated political protest but natural working-class skepticism toward royal pomp. This authenticity is both his strength and his vulnerability.\r\n\r\nAs the years progress and MI5's psychological campaign takes effect, John's motivations evolve from casual rebellion to genuine political awakening. The establishment's pushback against his increasingly radical views only confirms his suspicions about power structures, creating a feedback loop that serves Philip's goals perfectly.\r\n\r\nBy 1969, his decision to return the MBE represents the culmination of both his natural evolution and the Committee's manipulation. The \"Cold Turkey\" reference in his letter reveals his inability to separate the personal from the political - a character flaw that makes him simultaneously authentic and easy to dismiss.\r\n\r\n## Internal Conflict\r\n\r\nJohn is torn between his desire for peace and his naturally combative personality. He preaches love and understanding while being quick to anger and harsh judgment. This contradiction makes him vulnerable - he genuinely wants to make the world better but his methods often alienate the very people he needs to reach.\r\n\r\nHe's also caught between his loyalty to The Beatles (his artistic family) and his growing need for individual expression. Every choice that serves his personal growth seems to damage the band, creating guilt that he masks with defiance.\r\n\r\n## Character Arc\r\n\r\n**Act 1 (1965): The Unwitting Catalyst** - At age 25, John's irreverent \"killing people\" comment at the MBE ceremony is pure instinct, not calculated rebellion. He's uncomfortable with royal formality but hasn't yet developed the political consciousness that will define his later years. His casual disrespect unknowingly triggers Philip's vendetta.\r\n\r\n**Act 2 (1966-1968): The Manipulated Radical** - During Operation Minuet, John experiences the \"Jesus\" controversy (amplified by Clive Barrow), growing media hostility, and increasing pressure that radicalizes him exactly as the Committee intended. Each MI5 manipulation pushes him further toward the anti-establishment stance Philip wants to destroy. His growing political awareness is genuine but partially orchestrated.\r\n\r\n**Act 3 (1969-1970): The Defiant Target** - John's MBE return in November 1969 represents his full transformation into the threat Philip always claimed he was. The failed assassination attempt at the charity concert passes him by entirely - he never knows how close he came to death. His \"victory\" is simply surviving and continuing to create, unaware of the forces that tried to destroy him.\r\n\r\n## Psychological Profile\r\n\r\n**Core Traits:**\r\n\r\n- Brilliant but impatient intellect\r\n- Deep empathy masked by defensive cynicism\r\n- Addictive personality (extends beyond substances to causes, people, ideas)\r\n- Profound need for authenticity in an increasingly artificial world\r\n\r\n**Defense Mechanisms:**\r\n\r\n- Sarcasm and wit to deflect emotional vulnerability\r\n- Aggression when feeling cornered or misunderstood\r\n- Intellectual superiority to maintain distance from others\r\n- Art as emotional outlet when direct communication fails\r\n\r\n**Vulnerabilities:**\r\n\r\n- Abandonment anxiety (father left, mother died, now band fracturing)\r\n- Impostor syndrome despite massive success\r\n- Susceptible to paranoia when under pressure\r\n- Self-destructive tendencies when feeling trapped\r\n\r\n## Key Relationships\r\n\r\n### Yoko Ono\r\n\r\nHis emotional anchor and intellectual equal. She validates his artistic ambitions beyond The Beatles and shares his political convictions. To his enemies, she represents the foreign influence corrupting a British icon. To John, she's the first person who loves the man rather than the Beatle.\r\n\r\nTheir relationship intensifies his isolation from the band while strengthening his resolve to be authentic. She becomes both his greatest strength and his most obvious weakness.\r\n\r\n### Paul McCartney\r\n\r\nThe creative partnership that defined his career now feels like a cage. Paul represents the commercial, safe path - maintaining The Beatles brand at the cost of individual growth. Their conflict isn't personal but philosophical: stability vs. evolution, group harmony vs. personal truth.\r\n\r\nJohn loves Paul but resents needing him. Paul's diplomatic nature frustrates John's desire for direct confrontation with authority.\r\n\r\n### Prince Philip (Unknown Nemesis)\r\n\r\nPhilip becomes John's secret nemesis after the 1965 MBE ceremony, viewing John's casual irreverence as a personal insult to the Crown and everything Philip represents. The \"killing people\" quip transforms Philip's general disdain for The Beatles into a specific, burning hatred for John as an individual.\r\n\r\nJohn remains completely unaware of Philip's five-year campaign against him. He senses growing institutional hostility and media manipulation but attributes it to general establishment resistance to counterculture, not a personal royal vendetta. This dramatic irony drives the entire narrative - John's genuine political evolution is partially the result of Philip's attempts to destroy him.\r\n\r\n### George Harrison\r\n\r\nThe spiritual seeker who John both admires and envies. George found peace through Eastern philosophy while John remains tortured by Western activism. Their relationship shows John's path not taken - inner peace vs. external revolution.\r\n\r\n## Historical Timeline Context\r\n\r\n**October 26, 1965:** At age 25, John receives his MBE at Buckingham Palace. His casual \"killing people\" comment to reporters afterward triggers Prince Philip's fury and the formation of the Committee for National Decorum.\r\n\r\n**1966:** The \"Jesus\" controversy erupts, amplified by Clive Barrow feeding inflammatory quotes to American press. John experiences his first taste of serious backlash, beginning his political awakening.\r\n\r\n**1967-1968:** During Operation Minuet's peak, John faces increasing media hostility and institutional pressure. The Maharishi trip (subtly funded by the Committee) temporarily removes The Beatles from the equation but deepens John's spiritual and political questioning.\r\n\r\n**November 25, 1969:** John returns his MBE, citing Vietnam and Biafra.

His casual irreverence at the 1965 MBE ceremony - the “killing people” quip - isn’t calculated political protest but natural working-class skepticism toward royal pomp. This authenticity is both his strength and his vulnerability.</p>\n<p>As the years progress and MI5’s psychological campaign takes effect, John’s motivations evolve from casual rebellion to genuine political awakening. The establishment’s pushback against his increasingly radical views only confirms his suspicions about power structures, creating a feedback loop that serves Philip’s goals perfectly.</p>\n<p>By 1969, his decision to return the MBE represents the culmination of both his natural evolution and the Committee’s manipulation. The “Cold Turkey” reference in his letter reveals his inability to separate the personal from the political - a character flaw that makes him simultaneously authentic and easy to dismiss.</p>\n<h2 id=\"internal-conflict\">Internal Conflict</h2>\n<p>John is torn between his desire for peace and his naturally combative personality. He preaches love and understanding while being quick to anger and harsh judgment. This contradiction makes him vulnerable - he genuinely wants to make the world better but his methods often alienate the very people he needs to reach.</p>\n<p>He’s also caught between his loyalty to The Beatles (his artistic family) and his growing need for individual expression. Every choice that serves his personal growth seems to damage the band, creating guilt that he masks with defiance.</p>\n<h2 id=\"character-arc\">Character Arc</h2>\n<p><strong>Act 1 (1965): The Unwitting Catalyst</strong> - At age 25, John’s irreverent “killing people” comment at the MBE ceremony is pure instinct, not calculated rebellion. He’s uncomfortable with royal formality but hasn’t yet developed the political consciousness that will define his later years. His casual disrespect unknowingly triggers Philip’s vendetta.</p>\n<p><strong>Act 2 (1966-1968): The Manipulated Radical</strong> - During Operation Minuet, John experiences the “Jesus” controversy (amplified by Clive Barrow), growing media hostility, and increasing pressure that radicalizes him exactly as the Committee intended. Each MI5 manipulation pushes him further toward the anti-establishment stance Philip wants to destroy. His growing political awareness is genuine but partially orchestrated.</p>\n<p><strong>Act 3 (1969-1970): The Defiant Target</strong> - John’s MBE return in November 1969 represents his full transformation into the threat Philip always claimed he was. The failed assassination attempt at the charity concert passes him by entirely - he never knows how close he came to death. His “victory” is simply surviving and continuing to create, unaware of the forces that tried to destroy him.</p>\n<h2 id=\"psychological-profile\">Psychological Profile</h2>\n<p><strong>Core Traits:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Brilliant but impatient intellect</li>\n<li>Deep empathy masked by defensive cynicism</li>\n<li>Addictive personality (extends beyond substances to causes, people, ideas)</li>\n<li>Profound need for authenticity in an increasingly artificial world</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Defense Mechanisms:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Sarcasm and wit to deflect emotional vulnerability</li>\n<li>Aggression when feeling cornered or misunderstood</li>\n<li>Intellectual superiority to maintain distance from others</li>\n<li>Art as emotional outlet when direct communication fails</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Vulnerabilities:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Abandonment anxiety (father left, mother died, now band fracturing)</li>\n<li>Impostor syndrome despite massive success</li>\n<li>Susceptible to paranoia when under pressure</li>\n<li>Self-destructive tendencies when feeling trapped</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"key-relationships\">Key Relationships</h2>\n<h3 id=\"yoko-ono\">Yoko Ono</h3>\n<p>His emotional anchor and intellectual equal. She validates his artistic ambitions beyond The Beatles and shares his political convictions. To his enemies, she represents the foreign influence corrupting a British icon. To John, she’s the first person who loves the man rather than the Beatle.</p>\n<p>Their relationship intensifies his isolation from the band while strengthening his resolve to be authentic. She becomes both his greatest strength and his most obvious weakness.</p>\n<h3 id=\"paul-mccartney\">Paul McCartney</h3>\n<p>The creative partnership that defined his career now feels like a cage. Paul represents the commercial, safe path - maintaining The Beatles brand at the cost of individual growth. Their conflict isn’t personal but philosophical: stability vs. evolution, group harmony vs. personal truth.</p>\n<p>John loves Paul but resents needing him. Paul’s diplomatic nature frustrates John’s desire for direct confrontation with authority.</p>\n<h3 id=\"prince-philip-unknown-nemesis\">Prince Philip (Unknown Nemesis)</h3>\n<p>Philip becomes John’s secret nemesis after the 1965 MBE ceremony, viewing John’s casual irreverence as a personal insult to the Crown and everything Philip represents. The “killing people” quip transforms Philip’s general disdain for The Beatles into a specific, burning hatred for John as an individual.</p>\n<p>John remains completely unaware of Philip’s five-year campaign against him. He senses growing institutional hostility and media manipulation but attributes it to general establishment resistance to counterculture, not a personal royal vendetta. This dramatic irony drives the entire narrative - John’s genuine political evolution is partially the result of Philip’s attempts to destroy him.</p>\n<h3 id=\"george-harrison\">George Harrison</h3>\n<p>The spiritual seeker who John both admires and envies. George found peace through Eastern philosophy while John remains tortured by Western activism. Their relationship shows John’s path not taken - inner peace vs. external revolution.</p>\n<h2 id=\"historical-timeline-context\">Historical Timeline Context</h2>\n<p><strong>October 26, 1965:</strong> At age 25, John receives his MBE at Buckingham Palace. His casual “killing people” comment to reporters afterward triggers Prince Philip’s fury and the formation of the Committee for National Decorum.</p>\n<p><strong>1966:</strong> The “Jesus” controversy erupts, amplified by Clive Barrow feeding inflammatory quotes to American press. John experiences his first taste of serious backlash, beginning his political awakening.</p>\n<p><strong>1967-1968:</strong> During Operation Minuet’s peak, John faces increasing media hostility and institutional pressure. The Maharishi trip (subtly funded by the Committee) temporarily removes The Beatles from the equation but deepens John’s spiritual and political questioning.</p>\n<p><strong>November 25, 1969:</strong> John returns his MBE, citing Vietnam and Biafra.

He has no grand ambitions for creative control, political statements, or spiritual transcendence. He is the professional anchor of the band, showing up on time and doing his job with good humor. His primary goal is to de-escalate tension and maintain a sense of normalcy.\r\n\r\n## Internal Conflict\r\n\r\nRingo has almost no internal conflict, which is his defining characteristic in this story. His conflict is entirely external: he is a man who craves harmony trapped in a room of escalating discord. He is the sanest person in the asylum, watching his family fall apart and feeling a deep, simple sadness about it, but without any of the angst or paranoia of the others.\r\n\r\n## Character Arc\r\n\r\n**Act 1 (1965): The Comfortable Beatle** - At age 25, Ringo is the most at ease with the MBE ceremony's royal formality. He genuinely enjoys the honor and finds the whole thing \"quite nice, actually.\" His simple pleasure in the recognition contrasts sharply with John's irreverence and provides a baseline of normalcy.\r\n\r\n**Act 2 (1966-1968): The Immune Observer** - During Operation Minuet's peak psychological warfare, Ringo remains completely unaffected. He experiences the \"Jesus\" controversy, George's spiritual seeking, and growing band tensions as natural life events rather than orchestrated manipulation. His immunity to paranoia inadvertently frustrates MI5's efforts - he's the one who might cheerfully drink the \"wrong\" tea meant for someone else, completely short-circuiting their plots.\r\n\r\n**Act 3 (1969-1970): The Steady Witness** - Ringo watches John's MBE return and the band's dissolution with simple sadness but no dramatic angst. During the failed assassination attempt, he's likely focused on his drumming, completely unaware of the danger. His consistency throughout the chaos highlights the absurdity of everyone else's turmoil. The breakup is sad, but he lands on his feet, ready for whatever comes next.\r\n\r\n## Psychological Profile\r\n\r\n**Core Traits:**\r\n\r\n- Amiable and good-natured\r\n- Grounded and pragmatic\r\n- Professional and reliable\r\n- Lacking in ego\r\n- A natural peacemaker\r\n\r\n**Vulnerabilities:**\r\n\r\n- His only real vulnerability is his genuine sadness at watching his friends' relationships deteriorate. He is completely immune to flattery, psychological manipulation, or paranoia. This is why the Committee for National Decorum's file on him simply says, \"Ignore - no viable angle of attack.\" His uncomplicated decency is a force more powerful than their sophisticated espionage.\r\n\r\n## Key Relationships\r\n\r\n### John, Paul & George\r\n\r\nHe is the universal brother. He is the only one who maintains a genuinely uncomplicated friendship with the other three throughout the turmoil. He serves as a reliable confidant for all of them, offering a sympathetic ear without taking sides.\r\n\r\n### The Committee for National Decorum (Philip, Nigel, Clive)\r\n\r\nRingo has no relationship with any of the conspirators because they literally cannot find an angle of attack. Philip's psychological profile of him concludes he's \"too simple to be a threat or a useful tool.\" Nigel and Clive never even attempt to manipulate him - his straightforward nature offers no psychological leverage. He is their blind spot, and his simple good nature inadvertently undermines their sophisticated schemes through pure, uncomplicated decency.\r\n\r\n## Historical Timeline Context\r\n\r\n**October 26, 1965:** At age 25, Ringo genuinely enjoys receiving his MBE, finding the royal ceremony \"quite nice\" and feeling honored by the recognition. His simple pleasure contrasts with his bandmates' various levels of discomfort.\r\n\r\n**1966-1968:** During Operation Minuet's psychological campaign, Ringo remains completely unaffected by the manipulation attempts. He experiences the \"Jesus\" controversy, media hostility, and band tensions as normal life events, never suspecting orchestration.\r\n\r\n**1969:** When John returns his MBE, Ringo feels sad for his friend but doesn't judge the decision. He continues to maintain uncomplicated relationships with all his bandmates despite their growing divisions.\r\n\r\n**1970:** During the Let It Be sessions and the failed assassination attempt, Ringo remains focused on the music and his friendships.

He has no grand ambitions for creative control, political statements, or spiritual transcendence. He is the professional anchor of the band, showing up on time and doing his job with good humor. His primary goal is to de-escalate tension and maintain a sense of normalcy.</p>\n<h2 id=\"internal-conflict\">Internal Conflict</h2>\n<p>Ringo has almost no internal conflict, which is his defining characteristic in this story. His conflict is entirely external: he is a man who craves harmony trapped in a room of escalating discord.

He experiences the “Jesus” controversy, George’s spiritual seeking, and growing band tensions as natural life events rather than orchestrated manipulation. His immunity to paranoia inadvertently frustrates MI5’s efforts - he’s the one who might cheerfully drink the “wrong” tea meant for someone else, completely short-circuiting their plots.</p>\n<p><strong>Act 3 (1969-1970): The Steady Witness</strong> - Ringo watches John’s MBE return and the band’s dissolution with simple sadness but no dramatic angst. During the failed assassination attempt, he’s likely focused on his drumming, completely unaware of the danger. His consistency throughout the chaos highlights the absurdity of everyone else’s turmoil. The breakup is sad, but he lands on his feet, ready for whatever comes next.</p>\n<h2 id=\"psychological-profile\">Psychological Profile</h2>\n<p><strong>Core Traits:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Amiable and good-natured</li>\n<li>Grounded and pragmatic</li>\n<li>Professional and reliable</li>\n<li>Lacking in ego</li>\n<li>A natural peacemaker</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Vulnerabilities:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>His only real vulnerability is his genuine sadness at watching his friends’ relationships deteriorate.

From the awkwardness of the 1965 MBE ceremony through the chaos of the Let It Be sessions, he consistently tries to maintain professionalism and group cohesion while his bandmates drift toward individual pursuits.\r\n\r\nHis conventional worldview makes him naturally more comfortable with establishment approval than John's rebellious instincts. This fundamental difference becomes weaponized by Operation Minuet - when Nigel Finch plants the fake knighthood letter in 1969, Paul's positive reaction serves the Committee's goal of creating ideological division within the band.\r\n\r\nPaul's deep love for John drives his increasingly desperate attempts to \"save\" his creative partner from what he perceives as Yoko's malicious influence. He fails to recognize that the real manipulation comes from MI5, not from John's girlfriend, making him an unwitting accomplice in his own band's destruction.\r\n\r\n## Internal Conflict\r\n\r\nPaul is trapped between his role as a creative partner and his self-appointed role as a manager. He wants to be John's musical equal, but he spends most of his energy trying to manage John's volatility and Yoko's presence. This creates immense frustration, as he feels he's the only one taking their career seriously.\r\n\r\nHis deepest conflict is between his loyalty to John and his growing belief that Yoko is a malicious influence. He doesn't want to betray his friend, but he becomes increasingly convinced that he must \"save\" John from her. This leads him to misinterpret every event, seeing a conspiracy led by Yoko when the real one is aimed at him.\r\n\r\n## Character Arc\r\n\r\n**Act 1 (1965): The Diplomatic Beatle** - At age 23, Paul is already the band's unofficial diplomat and organizer. At the MBE ceremony, he's more comfortable with the royal formality than John, though he shares some discomfort with the pomp. He tries to smooth over John's irreverent \"killing people\" comment, unknowingly helping to trigger Philip's vendetta.\r\n\r\n**Act 2 (1966-1968): The Unwitting Target** - During Operation Minuet, Paul experiences the band's growing tensions without understanding their orchestrated nature. The \"Jesus\" controversy, George's spiritual drift, and increasing media pressure all strain his efforts to maintain unity. In 1969, Nigel Finch's fake knighthood letter perfectly exploits Paul's conventional values, making him appear establishment-favored just as John becomes most radical.\r\n\r\n**Act 3 (1969-1970): The Misguided Protector** - Paul's paranoia about Yoko (amplified by seeing her with \"Klaus\"/Clive) makes him the perfect unwitting accomplice to the Committee's goals. His attempts to \"protect\" John from Yoko's influence actually push John further away, serving MI5's fracturing agenda. The failed assassination attempt passes him by entirely - he's focused on trying to save a band that's already doomed.\r\n\r\n## Psychological Profile\r\n\r\n**Core Traits:**\r\n\r\n- Diplomatic and PR-savvy\r\n- A natural people-pleaser\r\n- Immense work ethic and professionalism\r\n- Ambitious and conscious of public image\r\n- Sentimental and loyal to his history\r\n\r\n**Defense Mechanisms:**\r\n\r\n- Charm and humor to deflect tension\r\n- A \"thumbs-up\" optimism that masks deep anxiety\r\n- Passive-aggression when direct confrontation fails\r\n- Over-functioning; taking on more work to feel in control\r\n\r\n**Vulnerabilities:**\r\n\r\n- His need for control makes him panic when things become chaotic.\r\n- His conventional worldview makes him susceptible to establishment flattery (the knighthood).\r\n- His love for John makes him blind to the fact that John simply wants to leave.\r\n- His suspicion of Yoko is a convenient scapegoat for the band's deeper problems.\r\n\r\n## Key Relationships\r\n\r\n### John Lennon\r\n\r\nHis brother, his mirror, his rival, and his greatest source of creative joy and personal pain. Paul spends the entire story trying to \"get back\" to the partnership they once had, failing to realize that John has already moved on. Every diplomatic gesture Paul makes is interpreted by John as a conservative attempt to hold him back.\r\n\r\n### Yoko Ono (The Scapegoat)\r\n\r\nPaul sees Yoko not as a person, but as the personification of the problem. She is the physical manifestation of the forces tearing his family apart. Her avant-garde nature is completely alien to his pragmatic mind, making it easy for him to cast her as a sinister, controlling villain.\r\n\r\n### Nigel Finch (The Invisible Manipulator)\r\n\r\nPaul never meets Nigel but becomes his most successful target through the fake knighthood letter in 1969. Nigel perfectly understands Paul's psychology - his conventional values, his desire for establishment validation, and his love for John. The letter serves multiple purposes: it flatters Paul's ego, creates ideological distance between him and the increasingly radical John, and provides Paul with \"evidence\" that forces are working to divide the band (though he wrongly attributes this to Yoko, not MI5).\r\n\r\n### George & Ringo\r\n\r\nHis bandmates whom he sees as allies in the struggle to keep things \"normal.\" He is frustrated when George drifts away into his own spiritual world, leaving Paul feeling like the last sane man in the asylum. He relies on Ringo's steady presence as an emotional anchor.\r\n\r\n## Historical Timeline Context\r\n\r\n**October 26, 1965:** At age 23, Paul receives his MBE alongside the other Beatles. He's more comfortable with the royal ceremony than John, trying to maintain diplomatic composure when John makes his \"killing people\" comment to the press.\r\n\r\n**1966-1968:** During Operation Minuet's peak, Paul experiences mounting pressure to hold the band together as John becomes increasingly radical, George drifts toward spirituality, and media hostility grows. He attributes the chaos to natural band evolution, not orchestrated manipulation.\r\n\r\n**1969:** The pivotal year - Paul receives Nigel Finch's fake knighthood letter, designed to exploit his conventional values and create ideological distance from John. His positive reaction to the \"honor\" serves the Committee's goals perfectly, making him appear establishment-favored just as John returns his MBE.\r\n\r\n**1970:** During the Let It Be sessions and the failed assassination attempt, Paul remains focused on trying to save the band through professional discipline and organization, never knowing how close they all came to tragedy.\r\n\r\n## Historical Accuracy Notes\r\n\r\n**Documented Facts:**\r\n\r\n- Paul was indeed more comfortable with establishment recognition than John\r\n- He was the primary driving force behind late-period Beatles projects\r\n- His diplomatic nature often put him at odds with John's rebellious instincts\r\n- He genuinely saw Yoko's studio presence as disruptive to the band's working methods\r\n- His comment about John's MBE return being \"unnecessary\" is historically accurate\r\n\r\n**Creative Liberties:**\r\n\r\n- The fake knighthood letter from Nigel Finch is entirely fictional (Paul was actually knighted in 1997)\r\n- His paranoia about Yoko being part of a conspiracy is dramatically exaggerated\r\n- The connection between his conventional values and MI5's manipulation strategy is speculative\r\n- His role as an unwitting target in Operation Minuet is imagined\r\n\r\n**Sources:**\r\n\r\n- \"The Beatles: Get Back\" documentary series\r\n- Barry Miles' \"Paul McCartney: Many Years from Now\"\r\n- Public interviews from the 1969-1971 period\r\n- \"The Beatles Anthology\"\r\n\r\n## Voice and Dialogue Notes\r\n\r\n**Speech Patterns:**\r\n\r\n- Articulate, charming, and often diplomatic.\r\n- Tends to frame things in terms of what's \"best for the band.\"\r\n- Can become subtly pleading when trying to convince John of something.\r\n- When his frustration boils over, it's less explosive anger and more exasperated, cutting remarks.\r\n\r\n## Costume and Visual Notes\r\n\r\n**Physical Description:**\r\n\r\n- Boyish good looks, expressive eyes.\r\n- The most \"put-together\" Beatle during this period.\r\n\r\n**Attire:**\r\n\r\n- Fashion-conscious and sharp. Well-cut jackets, stylish knitwear, tailored trousers.\r\n- Even his casual wear looks considered. His appearance is a visual representation of his desire for order and professionalism, a stark contrast to John's evolving counter-culture look.\r\n\r\n## Scene-Specific Notes\r\n\r\n**Opening Scenes:**\r\nHe should be the picture of productive energy amidst the band's lethargy, trying to start a song, tapping his foot, looking expectantly at the others. His anxiety is palpable but masked by forced cheerfulness.\r\n\r\n**MBE Ceremony (1965):**\r\nPaul appears more comfortable with the royal formality than John, maintaining diplomatic composure. When John makes his \"killing people\" comment, Paul tries to smooth things over with charm, unknowingly helping to trigger Philip's vendetta.\r\n\r\n**Knighthood Letter Scene (1969):**\r\nThe moment Paul receives Nigel's fake knighthood letter should show complex emotions - flattery, pride, but also growing suspicion. He looks across at Yoko (who's been meeting with \"Klaus\"/Clive) and wrongly connects the dots, seeing her as the mastermind rather than recognizing the real MI5 manipulation.\r\n\r\n**Let It Be Sessions (1969-1970):**\r\nPaul appears increasingly desperate to maintain professional standards and band unity, not realizing his efforts are being undermined by forces beyond his understanding. His focus on organization contrasts with the chaos around him.\r\n\r\n**Epilogue (Mid-1970s):**\r\nPaul has found success with Wings, finally free to be the undisputed leader. He's moved on from the Beatles' breakup, never knowing that the band's destruction was partially orchestrated or that he was an unwitting target in a larger conspiracy.","src/content/characters/band/paul-mccartney.md","262dc7ea2be1275f",{html:7135,metadata:7136},"<h1 id=\"paul-mccartney\">Paul McCartney</h1>\n<h2 id=\"related-research\">Related Research</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/research/mccartney-key-influential-characters\">Influential Figures in the Life of Paul McCartney</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/research/mccartney-solo-career\">Solo Career Analysis - Paul McCartney</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/research/mccartney-quotes\">Paul McCartney Quotes</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"motivations\">Motivations</h2>\n<p>Paul’s primary motivation throughout the 1965-1970 period is preservation of The Beatles as both a creative unit and a surrogate family.

This leads him to misinterpret every event, seeing a conspiracy led by Yoko when the real one is aimed at him.</p>\n<h2 id=\"character-arc\">Character Arc</h2>\n<p><strong>Act 1 (1965): The Diplomatic Beatle</strong> - At age 23, Paul is already the band’s unofficial diplomat and organizer. At the MBE ceremony, he’s more comfortable with the royal formality than John, though he shares some discomfort with the pomp. He tries to smooth over John’s irreverent “killing people” comment, unknowingly helping to trigger Philip’s vendetta.</p>\n<p><strong>Act 2 (1966-1968): The Unwitting Target</strong> - During Operation Minuet, Paul experiences the band’s growing tensions without understanding their orchestrated nature. The “Jesus” controversy, George’s spiritual drift, and increasing media pressure all strain his efforts to maintain unity. In 1969, Nigel Finch’s fake knighthood letter perfectly exploits Paul’s conventional values, making him appear establishment-favored just as John becomes most radical.</p>\n<p><strong>Act 3 (1969-1970): The Misguided Protector</strong> - Paul’s paranoia about Yoko (amplified by seeing her with “Klaus”/Clive) makes him the perfect unwitting accomplice to the Committee’s goals. His attempts to “protect” John from Yoko’s influence actually push John further away, serving MI5’s fracturing agenda. The failed assassination attempt passes him by entirely - he’s focused on trying to save a band that’s already doomed.</p>\n<h2 id=\"psychological-profile\">Psychological Profile</h2>\n<p><strong>Core Traits:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Diplomatic and PR-savvy</li>\n<li>A natural people-pleaser</li>\n<li>Immense work ethic and professionalism</li>\n<li>Ambitious and conscious of public image</li>\n<li>Sentimental and loyal to his history</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Defense Mechanisms:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Charm and humor to deflect tension</li>\n<li>A “thumbs-up” optimism that masks deep anxiety</li>\n<li>Passive-aggression when direct confrontation fails</li>\n<li>Over-functioning; taking on more work to feel in control</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Vulnerabilities:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>His need for control makes him panic when things become chaotic.</li>\n<li>His conventional worldview makes him susceptible to establishment flattery (the knighthood).</li>\n<li>His love for John makes him blind to the fact that John simply wants to leave.</li>\n<li>His suspicion of Yoko is a convenient scapegoat for the band’s deeper problems.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"key-relationships\">Key Relationships</h2>\n<h3 id=\"john-lennon\">John Lennon</h3>\n<p>His brother, his mirror, his rival, and his greatest source of creative joy and personal pain. Paul spends the entire story trying to “get back” to the partnership they once had, failing to realize that John has already moved on. Every diplomatic gesture Paul makes is interpreted by John as a conservative attempt to hold him back.</p>\n<h3 id=\"yoko-ono-the-scapegoat\">Yoko Ono (The Scapegoat)</h3>\n<p>Paul sees Yoko not as a person, but as the personification of the problem. She is the physical manifestation of the forces tearing his family apart. Her avant-garde nature is completely alien to his pragmatic mind, making it easy for him to cast her as a sinister, controlling villain.</p>\n<h3 id=\"nigel-finch-the-invisible-manipulator\">Nigel Finch (The Invisible Manipulator)</h3>\n<p>Paul never meets Nigel but becomes his most successful target through the fake knighthood letter in 1969. Nigel perfectly understands Paul’s psychology - his conventional values, his desire for establishment validation, and his love for John. The letter serves multiple purposes: it flatters Paul’s ego, creates ideological distance between him and the increasingly radical John, and provides Paul with “evidence” that forces are working to divide the band (though he wrongly attributes this to Yoko, not MI5).</p>\n<h3 id=\"george--ringo\">George &#x26; Ringo</h3>\n<p>His bandmates whom he sees as allies in the struggle to keep things “normal.” He is frustrated when George drifts away into his own spiritual world, leaving Paul feeling like the last sane man in the asylum. He relies on Ringo’s steady presence as an emotional anchor.</p>\n<h2 id=\"historical-timeline-context\">Historical Timeline Context</h2>\n<p><strong>October 26, 1965:</strong> At age 23, Paul receives his MBE alongside the other Beatles. He’s more comfortable with the royal ceremony than John, trying to maintain diplomatic composure when John makes his “killing people” comment to the press.</p>\n<p><strong>1966-1968:</strong> During Operation Minuet’s peak, Paul experiences mounting pressure to hold the band together as John becomes increasingly radical, George drifts toward spirituality, and media hostility grows. He attributes the chaos to natural band evolution, not orchestrated manipulation.</p>\n<p><strong>1969:</strong> The pivotal year - Paul receives Nigel Finch’s fake knighthood letter, designed to exploit his conventional values and create ideological distance from John. His positive reaction to the “honor” serves the Committee’s goals perfectly, making him appear establishment-favored just as John returns his MBE.</p>\n<p><strong>1970:</strong> During the Let It Be sessions and the failed assassination attempt, Paul remains focused on trying to save the band through professional discipline and organization, never knowing how close they all came to tragedy.</p>\n<h2 id=\"historical-accuracy-notes\">Historical Accuracy Notes</h2>\n<p><strong>Documented Facts:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Paul was indeed more comfortable with establishment recognition than John</li>\n<li>He was the primary driving force behind late-period Beatles projects</li>\n<li>His diplomatic nature often put him at odds with John’s rebellious instincts</li>\n<li>He genuinely saw Yoko’s studio presence as disruptive to the band’s working methods</li>\n<li>His comment about John’s MBE return being “unnecessary” is historically accurate</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Creative Liberties:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>The fake knighthood letter from Nigel Finch is entirely fictional (Paul was actually knighted in 1997)</li>\n<li>His paranoia about Yoko being part of a conspiracy is dramatically exaggerated</li>\n<li>The connection between his conventional values and MI5’s manipulation strategy is speculative</li>\n<li>His role as an unwitting target in Operation Minuet is imagined</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Sources:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>“The Beatles: Get Back” documentary series</li>\n<li>Barry Miles’ “Paul McCartney: Many Years from Now”</li>\n<li>Public interviews from the 1969-1971 period</li>\n<li>“The Beatles Anthology”</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"voice-and-dialogue-notes\">Voice and Dialogue Notes</h2>\n<p><strong>Speech Patterns:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Articulate, charming, and often diplomatic.</li>\n<li>Tends to frame things in terms of what’s “best for the band.”</li>\n<li>Can become subtly pleading when trying to convince John of something.</li>\n<li>When his frustration boils over, it’s less explosive anger and more exasperated, cutting remarks.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"costume-and-visual-notes\">Costume and Visual Notes</h2>\n<p><strong>Physical Description:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Boyish good looks, expressive eyes.</li>\n<li>The most “put-together” Beatle during this period.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Attire:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fashion-conscious and sharp.

His anxiety is palpable but masked by forced cheerfulness.</p>\n<p><strong>MBE Ceremony (1965):</strong>\r\nPaul appears more comfortable with the royal formality than John, maintaining diplomatic composure. When John makes his “killing people” comment, Paul tries to smooth things over with charm, unknowingly helping to trigger Philip’s vendetta.</p>\n<p><strong>Knighthood Letter Scene (1969):</strong>\r\nThe moment Paul receives Nigel’s fake knighthood letter should show complex emotions - flattery, pride, but also growing suspicion. He looks across at Yoko (who’s been meeting with “Klaus”/Clive) and wrongly connects the dots, seeing her as the mastermind rather than recognizing the real MI5 manipulation.</p>\n<p><strong>Let It Be Sessions (1969-1970):</strong>\r\nPaul appears increasingly desperate to maintain professional standards and band unity, not realizing his efforts are being undermined by forces beyond his understanding. His focus on organization contrasts with the chaos around him.</p>\n<p><strong>Epilogue (Mid-1970s):</strong>\r\nPaul has found success with Wings, finally free to be the undisputed leader. He’s moved on from the Beatles’ breakup, never knowing that the band’s destruction was partially orchestrated or that he was an unwitting target in a larger conspiracy.</p>",{headings:7137,localImagePaths:7160,remoteImagePaths:7161,frontmatter:7162,imagePaths:7165},[7138,7139,7140,7141,7142,7143,7144,7145,7146,7149,7152,7155,7156,7157,7158,7159],{depth:15,slug:1694,text:1695},{depth:89,slug:6990,text:6991},{depth:89,slug:6993,text:6994},{depth:89,slug:6996,text:6997},{depth:89,slug:6999,text:7000},{depth:89,slug:7002,text:7003},{depth:89,slug:7005,text:7006},{depth:64,slug:1692,text:1430},{depth:64,slug:7147,text:7148},"yoko-ono-the-scapegoat","Yoko Ono (The Scapegoat)",{depth:64,slug:7150,text:7151},"nigel-finch-the-invisible-manipulator","Nigel Finch (The Invisible Manipulator)",{depth:64,slug:7153,text:7154},"george--ringo","George & Ringo",{depth:89,slug:7016,text:7017},{depth:89,slug:7019,text:7020},{depth:89,slug:7022,text:7023},{depth:89,slug:7025,text:7026},{depth:89,slug:7028,text:7029},[],[],{name:1695,dialogue_name:3587,character_type:6972,role:7042,age:7163,occupation:7126,description:7127,first_appearance:6977,last_appearance:6979,created:7164},{act_1:1062,act_2:1178,act_3:1207},["Date","2025-01-15T00:00:00.000Z"],[],"band/paul-mccartney.md",{id:644,data:7168,body:7178,filePath:7179,digest:7180,rendered:7181,legacyId:7210},{name:1570,role:6971,character_type:6972,age:7169,occupation:7172,description:7173,first_appearance:7174,last_appearance:7176,created:7177},{act_1:1333,act_2:7170,act_3:7171},36,37,"Artist, Musician, Peace Activist","The avant-garde artist whose serene authenticity inadvertently disrupts Operation Minuet.

Her goal is to dissolve the boundaries between art and life, and to document her profound connection with John. She is not motivated by record sales, band politics, or public opinion. She operates on a completely different philosophical plane from everyone else in the story. Her motivation is simply to *be* and to *create* with John, making her utterly un-recruitable and incomprehensible to the establishment.\r\n\r\n## Internal Conflict\r\n\r\nLike Ringo, Yoko has very little internal conflict. She is supremely confident in her vision and her love for John. Her conflict is external: she is a serene, conceptual being placed in a world of pop-star egos and bumbling spies, and she cannot understand why they are all so agitated. She views their paranoia and suspicion with a kind of detached, artistic curiosity.\r\n\r\n## Character Arc\r\n\r\nYoko's arc is defined by her impact on others rather than personal transformation. She remains the unmovable object that Operation Minuet crashes against.\r\n\r\n**Act 1 (1965-1967): The Absent Artist** - Yoko exists in the avant-garde art world, unaware that across the Atlantic, a royal conspiracy is forming that will eventually entangle her. Her conceptual art and Eastern philosophy make her the perfect unknowing foil to Western establishment thinking.\r\n\r\n**Act 2 (1968-1969): The Misinterpreted Presence** - After meeting John in 1966, Yoko enters the Beatles' world just as Operation Minuet reaches its peak. Her every artistic act is misinterpreted: Clive (as \"Klaus\") sees her as a potential recruit, Paul sees her as a saboteur, and the Committee sees her as foreign influence corrupting John. Her serene authenticity inadvertently fuels the very paranoia she's unaware of.\r\n\r\n**Act 3 (1970): The Accidental Savior** - At the charity concert, Yoko's spontaneous conceptual scream - a pure artistic expression - accidentally disrupts the assassination plot. She saves John's life not through heroic action but through unwavering commitment to being herself. She ends as she began: a serene, misunderstood artist, now free to create with John beyond the reach of royal conspiracies.\r\n\r\n## Psychological Profile\r\n\r\n**Core Traits:**\r\n\r\n- Unflappably serene\r\n- Intellectually and artistically self-assured\r\n- Operates on a logic separate from the conventional world\r\n- Deeply intuitive and perceptive\r\n\r\n**Vulnerabilities:**\r\n\r\n- Her only true vulnerability is her love for John. An attack on him is the only thing that can genuinely pierce her serene armor.\r\n\r\n## Key Relationships\r\n\r\n### John Lennon\r\n\r\nHer partner, collaborator, and other half. They are a self-contained unit, speaking a language only they understand. She is his anchor and the validator of his post-Beatles identity.\r\n\r\n### Clive Barrow (\"Klaus\" - The Misguided Recruiter)\r\n\r\nThis relationship represents one of the film's core comedic ironies. From 1968-1970, Clive (disguised as \"Klaus,\" a German art critic) desperately attempts to recruit Yoko as an MI5 asset. His fundamental misunderstanding of her character leads him to believe she can be \"turned\" against John or used to manipulate him. Yoko interprets his clumsy, coded approaches as the endearing efforts of an eccentric but passionate European art enthusiast. She's genuinely pleased to find someone who seems to appreciate conceptual art, completely missing his ulterior motives. Her innocent engagement with \"Klaus\" inadvertently provides Paul with \"evidence\" of a conspiracy - the wrong conspiracy.\r\n\r\n### Paul McCartney (The Worried Friend)\r\n\r\nShe sees Paul as John's well-meaning but conventional friend who is frightened by their love and their art. She likely views his suspicion with a detached pity rather than malice.\r\n\r\n## Historical Timeline Context\r\n\r\n**1965-1967:** Yoko exists in the New York avant-garde art scene, creating conceptual works and performance pieces. She's unaware that her future partner is triggering a royal conspiracy across the Atlantic with his \"killing people\" comment at the MBE ceremony.\r\n\r\n**November 1966:** Yoko meets John at her Indica Gallery exhibition in London. This meeting occurs during Operation Minuet's early phase, though she's unaware of the psychological campaign swirling around The Beatles.\r\n\r\n**1968:** Yoko enters John's world just as Operation Minuet intensifies. Her presence in Beatles sessions is unprecedented and controversial. Clive Barrow begins his \"Klaus\" infiltration, seeing her as a potential asset to manipulate John.\r\n\r\n**1969:** The pivotal year - Yoko's relationship with John deepens as he becomes increasingly radical. When John returns his MBE in November, she supports his decision without understanding it's the culmination of Philip's five-year psychological campaign. Paul's paranoia about her \"meetings\" with Klaus reaches its peak.\r\n\r\n**1970:** During the charity concert and failed assassination attempt, Yoko's spontaneous artistic expression accidentally saves John's life. The Beatles' breakup allows her and John to escape the conspiracy's reach entirely.\r\n\r\n## Historical Accuracy Notes\r\n\r\n**Documented Facts:**\r\n\r\n- Yoko was indeed a serious avant-garde artist before meeting John\r\n- Her relationship with John was intensely creative and collaborative\r\n- She faced significant racism and xenophobia from Beatles fans and British press\r\n- Her artistic background was in conceptual and performance art\r\n- She and John were genuinely committed to peace activism\r\n- Her presence at Beatles sessions was unprecedented and controversial\r\n\r\n**Creative Liberties:**\r\n\r\n- No evidence of MI5 attempting to recruit Yoko or seeing her as a potential asset\r\n- The \"Clive Barrow/Klaus\" character and multi-year infiltration attempt are entirely fictional\r\n- Her role in accidentally foiling an assassination plot through conceptual art is imagined\r\n- Her awareness of or involvement in any royal conspiracy is speculative\r\n- The timeline of her relationship with John compressed to serve the Operation Minuet narrative\r\n\r\n**Sources:**\r\n\r\n- Yoko Ono's own writings and interviews\r\n- \"John Lennon: The Life\" by Philip Norman\r\n- Contemporary art world coverage of her pre-Beatles work\r\n- \"The Beatles Anthology\" interviews\r\n- Yoko's later reflections on this period\r\n\r\n## Voice and Dialogue Notes\r\n\r\n**Speech Patterns:**\r\n\r\n- Speaks in conceptual, artistic terms\r\n- Often uses metaphors and abstract language\r\n- Calm, measured delivery even under pressure\r\n- Occasionally uses Japanese concepts or phrases\r\n- Intellectually sophisticated but emotionally direct\r\n\r\n**Emotional States:**\r\n\r\n- **Serene:** Speaks in flowing, philosophical terms about art and love\r\n- **Protective:** Becomes more direct and fierce when John is threatened\r\n- **Creative:** Animated when discussing artistic concepts, uses vivid imagery\r\n- **Confused:** Rare moments when others' hostility genuinely puzzles her\r\n\r\n**Key Phrases/Concepts:**\r\n\r\n- References to \"breaking boundaries\" and \"dissolving barriers\"\r\n- Art as life philosophy: \"Everything is art\"\r\n- Peace and love as practical concepts, not just ideals\r\n- Speaks of John as her \"other half\" or \"completion\"\r\n\r\n## Costume and Visual Notes\r\n\r\n**Physical Description:**\r\n\r\n- 5'2\", petite but commanding presence\r\n- Long, straight black hair often worn loose\r\n- Distinctive avant-garde fashion sense\r\n- Often wears black or white, minimalist aesthetic\r\n\r\n**Act 1:** Sophisticated art world attire - black turtlenecks, elegant coats, artistic jewelry\r\n**Act 2:** More casual but still distinctive - flowing fabrics, artistic accessories, always impeccably styled\r\n**Act 3:** Comfortable but artistic clothing for new life in America - still maintains her unique aesthetic\r\n\r\n**Symbolic Elements:**\r\n\r\n- Art supplies and conceptual pieces (represents her true calling)\r\n- Camera or recording equipment (documenting life with John)\r\n- Peace symbols and white clothing (her activism)\r\n- Books on Eastern philosophy and art theory\r\n\r\n## Scene-Specific Notes\r\n\r\n**Studio Sessions:**\r\nYoko should appear completely at ease despite the obvious tension around her. She observes everything with artistic curiosity, occasionally making notes or sketches.\r\n\r\n**Art Gallery Encounters:**\r\nWhen meeting \"Klaus\" (Clive), she is genuinely excited to discuss art with someone who seems to understand her work, completely missing his ulterior motives.\r\n\r\n**Indica Gallery Meeting (1966):**\r\nYoko appears completely absorbed in her art installation, genuinely surprised by John's interest. Her explanation of conceptual art should feel natural and unpretentious - she's sharing her passion, not performing.\r\n\r\n**\"Klaus\" Encounters (1968-1970):**\r\nYoko engages with Clive's \"Klaus\" persona with genuine artistic enthusiasm, pleased to find someone who seems to understand conceptual art. Her innocent responses to his coded recruitment attempts should highlight the comedy of his fundamental misunderstanding.\r\n\r\n**Let It Be Sessions (1969):**\r\nYoko maintains serene composure despite obvious tension around her. She observes the band dynamics with artistic curiosity, occasionally making notes or sketches, completely unaware she's being blamed for the fracturing.\r\n\r\n**Charity Concert Climax (1970):**\r\nHer conceptual scream that disrupts the assassination attempt should feel completely organic to her character - a spontaneous artistic expression, not a heroic rescue attempt. She's simply being herself at the moment when authenticity defeats conspiracy.\r\n\r\n**Epilogue (Mid-1970s):**\r\nYoko has found peace in her post-Beatles life with John, never knowing how her artistic authenticity inadvertently defeated a royal conspiracy. Her serene confidence reflects someone who has always remained true to herself.\r\n\r\n## Research Notes\r\n\r\n**Contemporary Context:**\r\n\r\n- Avant-garde art movement challenging traditional boundaries\r\n- Conceptual art and performance art gaining recognition\r\n- East-West cultural exchange in art world\r\n- Women artists fighting for recognition in male-dominated field\r\n- Anti-war movement incorporating artistic expression\r\n\r\n**Real Events to Reference:**\r\n\r\n- Yoko's \"Cut Piece\" performance (1964) - established her as serious artist\r\n- Her Indica Gallery exhibition where she met John (1966)\r\n- \"Bed-In for Peace\" campaigns (1969) - their collaborative activism\r\n- \"Two Virgins\" album controversy (1968) - their artistic collaboration\r\n- Her conceptual art pieces like \"Grapefruit\" instruction book\r\n\r\nThis character profile provides the foundation for writing Yoko as the serene, misunderstood artist whose unwavering authenticity inadvertently disrupts everyone else's schemes.","src/content/characters/band/yoko-ono.md","a30b49a271a9dee0",{html:7182,metadata:7183},"<h1 id=\"yoko-ono\">Yoko Ono</h1>\n<h2 id=\"motivations\">Motivations</h2>\n<p>Yoko is motivated by pure, abstract concepts: Art, Love, and Peace.

When Philip summons him after John's \"killing people\" comment in 1965, he sees not just a family crisis but a perfect case study in modern influence operations. This represents the evolution from wartime propaganda to peacetime cultural manipulation - a chance to prove that Cold War psychological tactics can neutralize soft power threats.\r\n\r\nHe's also driven by genuine concern for institutional stability. The Beatles represent a new form of cultural authority that could undermine traditional power structures. His strategic mind recognizes that their influence operates through emotional connection rather than formal hierarchy - making them both more dangerous and more vulnerable than conventional political opponents.\r\n\r\n## Internal Conflict\r\n\r\nMountbatten’s conflict is with the sheer absurdity of the mission. He is a man accustomed to dealing with nation-states, naval fleets, and concrete military objectives. He is now tasked with manipulating \"assets\" who follow no discernible logic and deploying operatives who are demonstrably second-rate. His internal struggle is maintaining his professional dignity while drawing up plans to stoke jealousy between musicians or encourage one to buy a sitar. He is a master chess player forced to play a game of Snakes and Ladders.\r\n\r\n## Character Arc\r\n\r\n**Act 1 (1965): The Strategic Architect** - At age 65, Mountbatten is recruited by Philip after John's MBE ceremony gaffe. He approaches the \"Beatles problem\" with the same analytical rigor he applied to D-Day planning, designing Operation Minuet as a multi-year psychological campaign. He's confident that systematic pressure can fracture any group dynamic.\r\n\r\n**Act 2 (1966-1968): The Fascinated Observer** - During Operation Minuet's execution, Mountbatten watches his strategies succeed through unexpected channels. The \"Jesus\" controversy, George's spiritual drift, and growing media hostility achieve his goals, but through the targets' own neuroses rather than direct manipulation. He documents these \"psychological ricochets\" with professional satisfaction and private bewilderment.\r\n\r\n**Act 3 (1969-1970): The Pragmatic Realist** - When John returns his MBE and Philip demands escalation to assassination, Mountbatten reluctantly designs the charity concert plot while privately doubting its wisdom. After the farcical failure, he oversees the cleanup with characteristic professionalism, having learned that cultural influence cannot be defeated through conventional warfare - only outlasted.\r\n\r\n## Psychological Profile\r\n\r\n**Core Traits:**\r\n\r\n- Dignified and authoritative\r\n- Immensely strategic and analytical\r\n- Paternalistic and deeply connected to the Royal Family\r\n- A product of the British Empire's old guard\r\n\r\n**Vulnerabilities:**\r\n\r\n- His worldview is outdated; he cannot truly comprehend the motivations of his targets.\r\n- His belief in top-down, orderly planning is ill-suited for the messy reality of the situation.\r\n\r\n## Key Relationships\r\n\r\n### Prince Philip\r\n\r\nHis nephew and client. Mountbatten provides the strategic framework for Philip's emotional rage. He is the calm, professional head to Philip's hot-tempered heart, translating raw anger into a (theoretically) actionable plan.\r\n\r\n### Princess Margaret\r\n\r\nHe likely views her with a kind of weary indulgence. Her theatrical and impractical suggestions are an irritating distraction from his carefully laid plans, which he dismisses with polite, paternalistic firmness.\r\n\r\n### Nigel Finch & Clive Barrow\r\n\r\nHis field agents. He briefs them as if they were elite commandos, but it's clear he has very low expectations for their performance. They are simply the flawed instruments he has been given to work with.\r\n\r\n## Historical Timeline Context\r\n\r\n**October 1965:** After John's \"killing people\" comment at the MBE ceremony triggers Philip's fury, Mountbatten is recruited to the Committee for National Decorum. At age 65, he applies his wartime psychological operations experience to design Operation Minuet - a multi-year campaign to fracture The Beatles through systematic pressure.\r\n\r\n**1966-1968:** Mountbatten oversees Operation Minuet's execution, coordinating MI5 assets Nigel Finch and Clive Barrow. He monitors the \"Jesus\" controversy amplification, George's spiritual manipulation, and the Committee's funding of the Maharishi tour. His strategies succeed, but through unexpected psychological channels that fascinate and bewilder him.\r\n\r\n**November 1969:** When John returns his MBE, Mountbatten recognizes it as both the operation's success (John became the threat Philip claimed he was) and its failure (the gesture gains John sympathy rather than condemnation). Philip's demand for escalation to assassination forces Mountbatten into unfamiliar territory.\r\n\r\n**1970:** Mountbatten reluctantly designs the charity concert assassination plot, recognizing it as a desperate measure. After its farcical failure and the Beatles' dissolution, he oversees the cleanup with professional detachment, having learned the limits of applying military logic to cultural phenomena.\r\n\r\n## Historical Accuracy Notes\r\n\r\n**Documented Facts:**\r\n\r\n- Mountbatten was indeed Prince Philip's uncle and mentor\r\n- He had extensive intelligence and military background from WWII and beyond\r\n- He was known for strategic thinking and careful planning\r\n- He maintained close relationships with the Royal Family throughout his life\r\n- He was involved in various government and military advisory roles\r\n- His personality was indeed authoritative and paternalistic\r\n\r\n**Creative Liberties:**\r\n\r\n- No evidence of Mountbatten involvement in any anti-Beatles conspiracy or Committee for National Decorum\r\n- Operation Minuet and his role as strategic architect are entirely fictional\r\n- His coordination of MI5 psychological operations against musicians is imagined\r\n- The charity concert assassination plot and his reluctant participation are speculative\r\n- His strategic analysis of 1960s counterculture as a soft power threat is extrapolated\r\n- His relationship with Philip regarding Beatles-related matters is fictional\r\n\r\n**Sources:**\r\n\r\n- \"Mountbatten: Hero of Our Time\" by Richard Hough\r\n- Royal family biographies and memoirs\r\n- Military and intelligence histories of the period\r\n- Contemporary accounts of his role in government\r\n- Philip Ziegler's official biography of Mountbatten\r\n\r\n## Voice and Dialogue Notes\r\n\r\n**Speech Patterns:**\r\n\r\n- Formal, precise military diction\r\n- Uses strategic and tactical terminology\r\n- Speaks in measured, authoritative tones\r\n- Occasionally uses naval or military metaphors\r\n- Maintains diplomatic courtesy even when frustrated\r\n\r\n**Emotional States:**\r\n\r\n- **Confident:** Speaks in clear, strategic terms with military precision\r\n- **Bemused:** Maintains composure but with subtle notes of confusion about modern culture\r\n- **Authoritative:** Uses commanding tone when giving orders or assessments\r\n- **Philosophical:** Reflective when discussing larger implications of events\r\n\r\n**Key Phrases/Concepts:**\r\n\r\n- Military and naval terminology applied to civilian situations\r\n- References to \"strategic objectives\" and \"tactical considerations\"\r\n- Speaks of duty, honor, and service to the Crown\r\n- Uses euphemisms for covert operations (\"special measures,\" \"alternative approaches\")\r\n\r\n## Costume and Visual Notes\r\n\r\n**Physical Description:**\r\n\r\n- 6'0\", distinguished bearing\r\n- Silver-white hair, immaculately groomed\r\n- Military posture and bearing despite civilian clothes\r\n- Often wears formal suits or naval dress when appropriate\r\n\r\n**Act 1:** Formal business attire - dark suits, military decorations when appropriate, projects authority\r\n**Act 2:** Maintains formal appearance while overseeing operations - still impeccably dressed but perhaps slightly more casual\r\n**Act 3:** Resigned dignity - still formal but with subtle signs of the operation's toll\r\n\r\n**Symbolic Elements:**\r\n\r\n- Military decorations and honors (his distinguished service)\r\n- Maps and strategic documents (his planning nature)\r\n- Naval or military artifacts in his office\r\n- Formal correspondence and official papers\r\n\r\n## Scene-Specific Notes\r\n\r\n**Committee Formation (1965):**\r\nMountbatten appears completely in his element when recruited by Philip, immediately recognizing the Beatles as a soft power threat requiring systematic neutralization. His strategic analysis should feel like a military briefing.\r\n\r\n**Operation Minuet Planning (1965-1966):**\r\nWhen designing the multi-year psychological campaign, Mountbatten uses military precision to address what is essentially a cultural problem. His confidence in systematic pressure reflects his wartime experience.\r\n\r\n**Progress Monitoring (1966-1968):**\r\nMountbatten maintains professional composure while documenting increasingly absurd developments - the \"Jesus\" controversy, sitar manipulation, Maharishi funding - treating them with the same analytical rigor as military intelligence.\r\n\r\n**Escalation Briefing (1969):**\r\nWhen Philip demands assassination after the MBE return, Mountbatten's reluctance should be subtle but clear. He designs the charity concert plot professionally while privately doubting its wisdom.\r\n\r\n**Final Assessment (1970):**\r\nIn the aftermath of the failed assassination and Beatles dissolution, Mountbatten displays the philosophical resignation of a strategist who has learned that cultural influence cannot be defeated through conventional warfare - only outlasted through institutional patience.\r\n\r\n## Research Notes\r\n\r\n**Contemporary Context:**\r\n\r\n- Cold War intelligence operations and psychological warfare\r\n- Decline of British Empire requiring new forms of soft power\r\n- Generational clash between wartime leaders and 1960s culture\r\n- Royal family's struggle to maintain relevance in changing times\r\n- Military establishment's difficulty understanding counterculture\r\n\r\n**Real Events to Reference:**\r\n\r\n- Mountbatten's role in Indian independence (1947) - his experience with complex political situations\r\n- His naval career and strategic planning experience\r\n- His involvement in various royal family crises and decisions\r\n- The changing role of intelligence services in peacetime\r\n- British establishment's response to 1960s social changes\r\n\r\nThis character profile provides the foundation for writing Mountbatten as the dignified military strategist whose old-world competence is both an asset and a limitation when dealing with the chaotic world of rock and roll.","src/content/characters/royalty/lord-mountbatten.md","030363fe55fe7e65",{html:7312,metadata:7313},"<h1 id=\"lord-mountbatten\">Lord Mountbatten</h1>\n<h2 id=\"related-research\">Related Research</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/research/mountbatten-quotes\">Mountbatten Quotes</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"motivations\">Motivations</h2>\n<p>Mountbatten is motivated by duty to the Crown and intellectual fascination with psychological warfare.

His internal struggle is maintaining his professional dignity while drawing up plans to stoke jealousy between musicians or encourage one to buy a sitar. He is a master chess player forced to play a game of Snakes and Ladders.</p>\n<h2 id=\"character-arc\">Character Arc</h2>\n<p><strong>Act 1 (1965): The Strategic Architect</strong> - At age 65, Mountbatten is recruited by Philip after John’s MBE ceremony gaffe. He approaches the “Beatles problem” with the same analytical rigor he applied to D-Day planning, designing Operation Minuet as a multi-year psychological campaign. He’s confident that systematic pressure can fracture any group dynamic.</p>\n<p><strong>Act 2 (1966-1968): The Fascinated Observer</strong> - During Operation Minuet’s execution, Mountbatten watches his strategies succeed through unexpected channels. The “Jesus” controversy, George’s spiritual drift, and growing media hostility achieve his goals, but through the targets’ own neuroses rather than direct manipulation. He documents these “psychological ricochets” with professional satisfaction and private bewilderment.</p>\n<p><strong>Act 3 (1969-1970): The Pragmatic Realist</strong> - When John returns his MBE and Philip demands escalation to assassination, Mountbatten reluctantly designs the charity concert plot while privately doubting its wisdom. After the farcical failure, he oversees the cleanup with characteristic professionalism, having learned that cultural influence cannot be defeated through conventional warfare - only outlasted.</p>\n<h2 id=\"psychological-profile\">Psychological Profile</h2>\n<p><strong>Core Traits:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Dignified and authoritative</li>\n<li>Immensely strategic and analytical</li>\n<li>Paternalistic and deeply connected to the Royal Family</li>\n<li>A product of the British Empire’s old guard</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Vulnerabilities:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>His worldview is outdated; he cannot truly comprehend the motivations of his targets.</li>\n<li>His belief in top-down, orderly planning is ill-suited for the messy reality of the situation.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"key-relationships\">Key Relationships</h2>\n<h3 id=\"prince-philip\">Prince Philip</h3>\n<p>His nephew and client.

At age 65, he applies his wartime psychological operations experience to design Operation Minuet - a multi-year campaign to fracture The Beatles through systematic pressure.</p>\n<p><strong>1966-1968:</strong> Mountbatten oversees Operation Minuet’s execution, coordinating MI5 assets Nigel Finch and Clive Barrow. He monitors the “Jesus” controversy amplification, George’s spiritual manipulation, and the Committee’s funding of the Maharishi tour. His strategies succeed, but through unexpected psychological channels that fascinate and bewilder him.</p>\n<p><strong>November 1969:</strong> When John returns his MBE, Mountbatten recognizes it as both the operation’s success (John became the threat Philip claimed he was) and its failure (the gesture gains John sympathy rather than condemnation). Philip’s demand for escalation to assassination forces Mountbatten into unfamiliar territory.</p>\n<p><strong>1970:</strong> Mountbatten reluctantly designs the charity concert assassination plot, recognizing it as a desperate measure. After its farcical failure and the Beatles’ dissolution, he oversees the cleanup with professional detachment, having learned the limits of applying military logic to cultural phenomena.</p>\n<h2 id=\"historical-accuracy-notes\">Historical Accuracy Notes</h2>\n<p><strong>Documented Facts:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Mountbatten was indeed Prince Philip’s uncle and mentor</li>\n<li>He had extensive intelligence and military background from WWII and beyond</li>\n<li>He was known for strategic thinking and careful planning</li>\n<li>He maintained close relationships with the Royal Family throughout his life</li>\n<li>He was involved in various government and military advisory roles</li>\n<li>His personality was indeed authoritative and paternalistic</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Creative Liberties:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>No evidence of Mountbatten involvement in any anti-Beatles conspiracy or Committee for National Decorum</li>\n<li>Operation Minuet and his role as strategic architect are entirely fictional</li>\n<li>His coordination of MI5 psychological operations against musicians is imagined</li>\n<li>The charity concert assassination plot and his reluctant participation are speculative</li>\n<li>His strategic analysis of 1960s counterculture as a soft power threat is extrapolated</li>\n<li>His relationship with Philip regarding Beatles-related matters is fictional</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Sources:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>“Mountbatten: Hero of Our Time” by Richard Hough</li>\n<li>Royal family biographies and memoirs</li>\n<li>Military and intelligence histories of the period</li>\n<li>Contemporary accounts of his role in government</li>\n<li>Philip Ziegler’s official biography of Mountbatten</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"voice-and-dialogue-notes\">Voice and Dialogue Notes</h2>\n<p><strong>Speech Patterns:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Formal, precise military diction</li>\n<li>Uses strategic and tactical terminology</li>\n<li>Speaks in measured, authoritative tones</li>\n<li>Occasionally uses naval or military metaphors</li>\n<li>Maintains diplomatic courtesy even when frustrated</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Emotional States:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Confident:</strong> Speaks in clear, strategic terms with military precision</li>\n<li><strong>Bemused:</strong> Maintains composure but with subtle notes of confusion about modern culture</li>\n<li><strong>Authoritative:</strong> Uses commanding tone when giving orders or assessments</li>\n<li><strong>Philosophical:</strong> Reflective when discussing larger implications of events</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Key Phrases/Concepts:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Military and naval terminology applied to civilian situations</li>\n<li>References to “strategic objectives” and “tactical considerations”</li>\n<li>Speaks of duty, honor, and service to the Crown</li>\n<li>Uses euphemisms for covert operations (“special measures,” “alternative approaches”)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"costume-and-visual-notes\">Costume and Visual Notes</h2>\n<p><strong>Physical Description:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>6’0”, distinguished bearing</li>\n<li>Silver-white hair, immaculately groomed</li>\n<li>Military posture and bearing despite civilian clothes</li>\n<li>Often wears formal suits or naval dress when appropriate</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Act 1:</strong> Formal business attire - dark suits, military decorations when appropriate, projects authority\r\n<strong>Act 2:</strong> Maintains formal appearance while overseeing operations - still impeccably dressed but perhaps slightly more casual\r\n<strong>Act 3:</strong> Resigned dignity - still formal but with subtle signs of the operation’s toll</p>\n<p><strong>Symbolic Elements:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Military decorations and honors (his distinguished service)</li>\n<li>Maps and strategic documents (his planning nature)</li>\n<li>Naval or military artifacts in his office</li>\n<li>Formal correspondence and official papers</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"scene-specific-notes\">Scene-Specific Notes</h2>\n<p><strong>Committee Formation (1965):</strong>\r\nMountbatten appears completely in his element when recruited by Philip, immediately recognizing the Beatles as a soft power threat requiring systematic neutralization.

He's motivated by a deep desire for respectability - both for the band and himself - viewing their success as validation of his vision that working-class Liverpool boys could conquer the establishment on their own terms.\r\n\r\nHis perfectionism stems from genuine love for the band combined with acute anxiety about their self-destructive tendencies. He knows their talent is extraordinary, but he also knows they're capable of throwing it all away with a careless comment or impulsive decision. The MBE represents the pinnacle of his achievement: making The Beatles acceptable to the very establishment that initially dismissed them.\r\n\r\n## Internal Conflict\r\n\r\nBrian is torn between his role as protector and his recognition that he cannot truly control his charges. He wants to shield them from the consequences of their actions while knowing that their authenticity - the very thing that makes them special - requires a certain amount of chaos and rebellion.\r\n\r\nHis deeper conflict is with his own identity: he's simultaneously an outsider (Jewish, gay, from a merchant family) trying to navigate the British establishment and an insider who has achieved unprecedented access to that world through his management of The Beatles. He's never quite sure if he belongs in either world, making him perpetually anxious about maintaining his position.\r\n\r\n## Character Arc\r\n\r\n**Act 1 (1965): The Proud Father** - At age 31, Brian is at the height of his confidence. The MBE ceremony represents everything he's worked toward - his \"boys\" being recognized by the establishment he's spent years courting. He hosts the celebration at his townhouse like a proud parent, but even in triumph, he's nervously monitoring the band's behavior, terrified they'll say something that undermines their new respectability.\r\n\r\n**Act 2 (1966-1967): The Overwhelmed Guardian** - As Operation Minuet unfolds, Brian finds himself fighting fires on multiple fronts. The \"Jesus\" controversy (amplified by Clive Barrow) forces him into damage control mode, while the band's growing creative tensions and drug experimentation push them beyond his ability to manage. His anxiety increases as he realizes the forces working against them are more sophisticated than typical press hostility.\r\n\r\n**Death (August 27, 1967): The Removed Protector** - Brian's accidental overdose removes the band's primary buffer against both internal conflicts and external manipulation. His death represents the end of The Beatles' protective cocoon and the beginning of their vulnerability to the very forces he spent years shielding them from.\r\n\r\n## Psychological Profile\r\n\r\n**Core Traits:**\r\n\r\n- Perfectionist with acute attention to detail\r\n- Deeply protective and paternal toward The Beatles\r\n- Anxious and prone to catastrophic thinking\r\n- Sophisticated and well-mannered, but insecure about his place in society\r\n- Genuinely loves music and recognizes exceptional talent\r\n\r\n**Vulnerabilities:**\r\n\r\n- His need for control in situations that are inherently chaotic\r\n- His anxiety about social acceptance and respectability\r\n- His tendency to internalize the band's problems as personal failures\r\n- His isolation - he has few confidants outside his professional relationships\r\n\r\n## Key Relationships\r\n\r\n### The Beatles (Collectively)\r\n\r\nHis \"boys\" - the relationship is genuinely paternal, combining unconditional love with constant worry. He sees them as extraordinary talents who need protection from their own impulses and the world's hostility. They represent both his greatest achievement and his greatest source of anxiety.\r\n\r\n### John Lennon\r\n\r\nThe most challenging relationship. Brian recognizes John's genius but is terrified of his unpredictability. John's \"killing people\" comment at the MBE ceremony represents Brian's worst nightmare - the moment when John's authenticity threatens everything they've built. He spends enormous energy trying to channel John's rebellious instincts into productive outlets.\r\n\r\n### Paul McCartney\r\n\r\nHis most reliable ally within the band. Paul understands the business side and shares Brian's concern for the band's image. Their relationship is built on mutual respect and shared pragmatism, though Brian sometimes worries that Paul's commercial instincts might stifle the band's artistic growth.\r\n\r\n### George Harrison\r\n\r\nBrian sympathizes with George's creative frustrations but struggles to address them without disrupting the Lennon-McCartney dynamic that drives the band's success. He recognizes George's talent but feels caught between George's legitimate grievances and the practical realities of the band's creative process.\r\n\r\n### Ringo Starr\r\n\r\nThe easiest relationship - Ringo's good nature and lack of ego make him Brian's most reliable source of stability within the group. Brian appreciates Ringo's diplomatic instincts and often relies on him to defuse tensions.\r\n\r\n## Historical Timeline Context\r\n\r\n**1962-1965: The Architect of Success** - Brian transforms The Beatles from Liverpool club performers into global superstars, carefully crafting their image and managing their transition from leather jackets to suits. His vision of making them acceptable to mainstream audiences culminates in the MBE ceremony.\r\n\r\n**October 1965: The Triumph** - The MBE ceremony represents the pinnacle of Brian's achievement, but John's \"killing people\" comment reveals the fragility of everything he's built. Brian's nervous energy at the celebration reflects his awareness that success has made them targets.\r\n\r\n**1966: The Jesus Crisis** - When John's \"more popular than Jesus\" comment (amplified by Clive Barrow) creates international controversy, Brian goes into full damage control mode. His handling of the crisis demonstrates both his skill as a manager and his deep anxiety about the band's public image.\r\n\r\n**1967: The Final Year** - As the band retreats into studio experimentation and drug use, Brian feels increasingly disconnected from their creative process. His accidental death on August 27, 1967, removes their primary protector just as Operation Minuet is achieving its goals.\r\n\r\n## Historical Accuracy Notes\r\n\r\n**Documented Facts:**\r\n\r\n- Brian Epstein was indeed The Beatles' manager from 1962 until his death in 1967\r\n- He was instrumental in transforming their image from leather-clad rockers to suited professionals\r\n- He was present at the MBE ceremony and hosted celebrations afterward\r\n- He struggled with anxiety and prescription drug dependency\r\n- His death was ruled accidental overdose of Carbitral\r\n- He was gay at a time when homosexuality was illegal in Britain\r\n- He came from a middle-class Jewish family in Liverpool\r\n- He genuinely loved The Beatles and was devastated by their growing independence\r\n\r\n**Creative Liberties:**\r\n\r\n- No evidence he was aware of any government conspiracy against The Beatles\r\n- His specific reactions to Operation Minuet events are imagined\r\n- The extent of his anxiety about the MBE ceremony aftermath is dramatized\r\n- His knowledge of MI5 involvement in amplifying controversies is fictional\r\n- The portrayal of his relationship dynamics with individual Beatles members is interpreted through the story's dramatic needs\r\n\r\n**Sources:**\r\n\r\n- \"The Beatles Anthology\" (2000)\r\n- \"Shout! The Beatles in Their Generation\" by Philip Norman\r\n- \"The Love You Make\" by Peter Brown and Steven Gaines\r\n- \"A Cellarful of Noise\" by Brian Epstein\r\n- Contemporary press coverage of The Beatles' career\r\n- BBC Archives and interview footage\r\n\r\n## Speech Patterns & Dialogue Notes\r\n\r\n**Vocabulary:**\r\n\r\n- Sophisticated and well-educated, but not pretentious\r\n- Uses terms of endearment for The Beatles (\"the boys,\" \"my lads\")\r\n- Business-oriented language mixed with genuine affection\r\n- Tends toward understatement when anxious (\"This is rather concerning\")\r\n\r\n**Tone:**\r\n\r\n- Warm but professional with The Beatles\r\n- Nervous energy when discussing public relations\r\n- Paternal and protective\r\n- Becomes more formal under stress\r\n\r\n**Characteristic Phrases:**\r\n\r\n- \"The boys\" (referring to The Beatles)\r\n- \"We must be careful here\"\r\n- \"This could be rather serious\"\r\n- \"I do think we should consider...\"\r\n\r\n**Example Dialogue Style:**\r\n\r\n```text\r\nBRIAN\r\n(nervously adjusting his tie)\r\nJohn, please. The press will be here any moment. We simply cannot afford another... misunderstanding.\r\n\r\nJOHN\r\nRelax, Eppy. I'll be good as gold.\r\n\r\nBRIAN\r\n(not reassured)\r\nThat's precisely what worries me.\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Cultural Context\r\n\r\n**Class Dynamics:**\r\nBrian represents the middle-class mediator between working-class talent and upper-class establishment. His Jewish background and sexuality make him doubly an outsider, driving his need to prove respectability through The Beatles' success.\r\n\r\n**1960s Social Change:**\r\nHe embodies the tension between traditional British values and emerging youth culture. His role is to make the revolutionary acceptable to the establishment without destroying what makes it revolutionary.\r\n\r\n**Music Industry Evolution:**\r\nBrian represents the new breed of artist manager - someone who sees popular music as art worthy of serious treatment and mainstream respect, not just commercial exploitation.","src/content/characters/band/brian-epstein.md","592bf32284ae57bd",{html:7357,metadata:7358},"<h1 id=\"brian-epstein\">Brian Epstein</h1>\n<h2 id=\"related-research\">Related Research</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/research/epstein-influences-impact\">Epstein Influences and Impact</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/research/epstein-business-management\">Epstein Business Management</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/research/epstein-quotes-and-voice\">Epstein Quotes and Voice</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"motivations\">Motivations</h2>\n<p>Brian is driven by an almost paternal need to protect and elevate The Beatles, whom he sees as both his greatest achievement and his most vulnerable charges.

John's casual \"killing people\" comment at the 1965 MBE ceremony isn't just disrespectful - it's a direct assault on everything Philip represents. The flippant dismissal of military sacrifice by someone receiving an honor \"for pop music\" triggers a fury that festers for five years.\r\n\r\nInitially motivated by duty to preserve royal dignity, Philip's vendetta becomes increasingly personal. Each phase of Operation Minuet that succeeds feeds his sense of righteousness, while each setback deepens his obsession. By 1969, when John returns the MBE with the \"Cold Turkey\" reference, Philip sees it as the ultimate vindication of his original assessment - proof that this was never about principle but narcissistic celebrity tantrum.\r\n\r\nHis escalation to assassination represents the complete corruption of his original protective instincts. What began as institutional defense becomes personal revenge, transforming a guardian of tradition into its greatest threat.\r\n\r\n## Internal Conflict\r\n\r\nPhilip's core conflict is between his desire for swift, military-style solutions and the infuriating constraints of his constitutional role. He is a man of action trapped in a world of ceremony. He cannot simply have Lennon arrested or silenced publicly; he must resort to clandestine, \"un-gentlemanly\" methods, which he finds distasteful.\r\n\r\nHe is forced to rely on civilian intelligence (the bumbling Nigel and Clive) instead of military commandos, and to engage in psychological warfare instead of a direct confrontation. This inefficiency and lack of dignity is a constant source of frustration, making him a commander fighting a war with weapons he despises.\r\n\r\n## Character Arc\r\n\r\n**Act 1 (1965): The Offended Patriarch** - At age 44, Philip's fury at John's \"killing people\" comment transforms him from dutiful consort to vengeful conspirator. He convenes the Committee for National Decorum and recruits Mountbatten, convinced that systematic pressure can neutralize this cultural threat. His righteous indignation feels entirely justified.\r\n\r\n**Act 2 (1966-1968): The Obsessed Strategist** - During Operation Minuet's execution, Philip becomes increasingly consumed by the campaign. The \"Jesus\" controversy, George's spiritual drift, and growing media hostility achieve his goals, but through the targets' own neuroses rather than his precise planning. His satisfaction is tainted by the chaotic, uncontrollable nature of his success.\r\n\r\n**Act 3 (1969-1970): The Failed Avenger** - John's MBE return triggers Philip's final escalation to assassination. His demand for Mountbatten to design the charity concert plot represents his complete moral corruption. When the farcical failure leaves him with no victory - only the sordid evidence of his conspiracy and the quiet humiliation of total defeat - he's transformed from protector to threat, guardian to destroyer.\r\n\r\n## Psychological Profile\r\n\r\n**Core Traits:**\r\n\r\n- Unshakeable sense of duty\r\n- Pragmatic and results-oriented\r\n- Emotionally repressed; sees sentiment as a weakness\r\n- Fiercely loyal to the institution of the monarchy and to his wife\r\n- Deeply traditional and skeptical of modernity\r\n\r\n**Defense Mechanisms:**\r\n\r\n- Acerbic wit and bluntness to dismiss ideas he finds foolish\r\n- A retreat into protocol and formal language when feeling challenged\r\n- Outbursts of anger to reassert dominance and control\r\n- Compartmentalization; able to separate his distasteful actions from his noble goals\r\n\r\n**Vulnerabilities:**\r\n\r\n- His immense pride; he cannot abide being slighted\r\n- A deep-seated insecurity about his perceived secondary role to the Queen\r\n- A total inability to comprehend or value counter-culture art and ideals\r\n- His plan's success relies on people he holds in complete contempt\r\n\r\n## Key Relationships\r\n\r\n### John Lennon (The Obsession)\r\n\r\nPhilip's relationship with John evolves from dismissive contempt to personal obsession over five years. John's 1965 \"killing people\" comment transforms him from annoying pop star to existential threat in Philip's mind. He projects all his anxieties about declining deference, duty, and British prestige onto this one musician. By 1969, John's MBE return represents the ultimate vindication of Philip's original fury - proof that his instincts were correct. John becomes not just a problem to be managed, but a personal enemy to be destroyed.\r\n\r\n### Queen Elizabeth II (The Conscience)\r\n\r\nShe is the personification of the Crown he is sworn to protect. He seeks her tacit approval but is willing to act against her better judgment, believing he is shielding her from the ugly necessities of power. Their scenes are a chess match of subtext, her quiet pragmatism clashing with his rigid principles.\r\n\r\n### Princess Margaret (The Enabler)\r\n\r\nHe finds her theatricality and emotional indulgence irritating, but her enthusiasm for the conspiracy makes her a useful, if unpredictable, ally. She represents the decadent chaos he normally dislikes, but he leverages it for his own ends.\r\n\r\n### Nigel Finch & Clive Barrow (The Tools)\r\n\r\nHis operatives. He views them with the weary contempt of a seasoned admiral forced to command a leaky fishing trawler. Their bumbling incompetence is a constant reminder that this is not the clean, honorable operation he wishes it was. His briefings with them are masterclasses in barely concealed frustration.\r\n\r\n## Historical Timeline Context\r\n\r\n**October 26, 1965:** At age 44, Philip witnesses John's \"killing people\" comment at the MBE ceremony. His immediate fury at this casual dismissal of military sacrifice triggers the formation of the Committee for National Decorum and the recruitment of Mountbatten to design Operation Minuet.\r\n\r\n**1966-1968:** Philip oversees Operation Minuet's execution, becoming increasingly obsessed with the campaign's progress. He monitors the \"Jesus\" controversy amplification, George's spiritual manipulation, and the Committee's funding of the Maharishi tour. Each success feeds his sense of righteousness while deepening his personal investment in John's destruction.\r\n\r\n**November 25, 1969:** John's MBE return represents both vindication and humiliation for Philip. The \"Cold Turkey\" reference confirms his original assessment of John's narcissism, but the gesture gains John sympathy rather than condemnation. Philip's demand for escalation to assassination reveals his complete moral corruption.\r\n\r\n**1970:** The charity concert assassination plot's farcical failure leaves Philip with total defeat. The Beatles dissolve, but through their own dynamics rather than his masterful design. He's left with the sordid evidence of his conspiracy and the quiet humiliation of having become the very threat to the Crown he claimed to be protecting against.\r\n\r\n## Historical Accuracy Notes\r\n\r\n**Documented Facts:**\r\n\r\n- Prince Philip was fiercely protective of the Queen and the monarchy\r\n- He had a military background and a deep respect for duty and service\r\n- He was famously blunt and often expressed impatience with modern sensibilities\r\n- There was significant establishment backlash to The Beatles' MBE\r\n\r\n**Creative Liberties:**\r\n\r\n- The central premise of Philip's five-year royal vendetta is entirely fictional\r\n- The Committee for National Decorum and Operation Minuet are dramatic inventions\r\n- His escalation from psychological warfare to assassination attempts is imagined\r\n- His personal obsession with John Lennon and transformation into the story's primary antagonist is speculative\r\n- His coordination with MI5 agents and Mountbatten regarding Beatles-related operations is fictional\r\n\r\n**Sources:**\r\n\r\n- Biographies by Philip Eade (\"Prince Philip: The Turbulent Early Life...\") and Gyles Brandreth (\"Philip and Elizabeth: Portrait of a Marriage\")\r\n- Transcripts from his 1969 NBC interview\r\n- Public speeches and contemporary news coverage of his public persona\r\n\r\n## Voice and Dialogue Notes\r\n\r\n**Speech Patterns:**\r\n\r\n- Clipped, upper-class, Received Pronunciation\r\n- Economical with words; often uses phrases instead of full sentences\r\n- Military-inflected language (\"operation,\" \"objective,\" \"asset\")\r\n- Prone to exasperated sighs and under-the-breath dismissals\r\n\r\n**Emotional States:**\r\n\r\n- **In Command:** Precise, direct, authoritative\r\n- **Frustrated:** Sarcastic, biting, condescending\r\n- **Angry:** Voice remains controlled but grows colder and sharper\r\n- **Reflective:** Quiet, clipped, speaks while looking out a window or at an object\r\n\r\n**Key Phrases/Concepts:**\r\n\r\n- \"Getting on with it\"\r\n- \"A sense of duty\"\r\n- \"The proper order of things\"\r\n- Dismissive references to \"these people\" or \"that sort of thing\"\r\n\r\n## Costume and Visual Notes\r\n\r\n**Physical Description:**\r\n\r\n- Tall, athletic posture, carries himself with military bearing\r\n- Always impeccably dressed; not a single detail out of place\r\n\r\n**Attire:**\r\n\r\n- Perfectly tailored Savile Row suits in dark, sober colors\r\n- Tweed sporting jackets for private moments at Balmoral or Sandringham\r\n- Full naval dress uniform in flashbacks or for formal portraits, a reminder of his past\r\n- His clothing is his armor, representing tradition and unassailable order\r\n\r\n**Symbolic Elements:**\r\n\r\n- Polished black shoes (always gleaming, a sign of discipline)\r\n- Heavy signet rings and cufflinks (the weight of his station)\r\n- The vast, orderly, and silent rooms he occupies\r\n\r\n## Scene-Specific Notes\r\n\r\n**MBE Ceremony (1965):**\r\nPhilip should appear increasingly rigid as John makes his \"killing people\" comment. His reaction builds from diplomatic discomfort to cold fury, setting the entire conspiracy in motion. The moment should feel like a match being struck.\r\n\r\n**Committee Formation (1965):**\r\nPhilip convenes the Committee with military precision, his wounded pride transforming into strategic planning. He should appear completely convinced of his moral authority while laying the groundwork for five years of obsession.\r\n\r\n**Operation Minuet Monitoring (1966-1968):**\r\nPhilip's satisfaction at the campaign's progress should be tainted by frustration that chaos, not his precise planning, is achieving his goals. His growing obsession becomes visible in his increasing attention to details.\r\n\r\n**MBE Return Response (1969):**\r\nWhen John returns the medal, Philip's reaction should show both vindication (\"I was right about him\") and humiliation (the gesture gains John sympathy). His demand for assassination reveals his complete moral corruption.\r\n\r\n**Final Palace Scene (1970):**\r\nPhilip stands alone after the farcical failure, having transformed from protector of the Crown to its greatest threat. He's left with the quiet humiliation of total defeat and the realization that his five-year vendetta accomplished nothing but his own moral destruction.","src/content/characters/royalty/prince-phillip.md","4ba6ff99be9e70f5",{html:7406,metadata:7407},"<h1 id=\"his-royal-highness-the-prince-philip-duke-of-edinburgh\">His Royal Highness The Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh</h1>\n<h2 id=\"related-research\">Related Research</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/research/phillip-key-influential-characters\">Key Influences</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/research/phillip-hunting-obsession\">Hunting Obsession</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/research/phillip-quotes\">Prince Philip Quotes</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"motivations\">Motivations</h2>\n<p>Philip is driven by wounded pride and institutional protectiveness that transforms into personal obsession.

At 35 in 1965, she's trapped between her wild youth and the suffocating propriety expected of a royal approaching middle age. Operation Minuet represents the perfect outlet - a five-year secret drama where she can play spy, rebel, and artist simultaneously.\r\n\r\nShe doesn't care about John Lennon personally or Philip's wounded pride; she cares about having the most fascinating secret in Britain. The conspiracy allows her to be simultaneously rebellious (against royal stuffiness) and establishment (serving the Crown's interests). Her famous quote, \"Disobedience is my joy,\" perfectly captures her approach to the Committee - turning duty into delicious mischief.\r\n\r\n## Internal Conflict\r\n\r\nMargaret's conflict is between her desire for excitement and the constraints of her position. This secret committee is the perfect solution, allowing her to be a rebellious agent of chaos while still operating at the highest level of the establishment. Her \"conflict\" is less a struggle and more a joyful indulgence. She actively works to make the conspiracy more theatrical and less practical, clashing with Mountbatten's sober planning.\r\n\r\n## Character Arc\r\n\r\nMargaret serves as the Committee's theatrical conscience, her arc defined by her evolving relationship with the five-year performance.\r\n\r\n**Act 1 (1965): The Delighted Co-Conspirator** - At 35, she joins the Committee with giddy enthusiasm, treating Philip's wounded pride as the opening act of a thrilling drama. She's absolutely delighted by the idea of a secret war against a pop star and immediately begins suggesting increasingly theatrical approaches.\r\n\r\n**Act 2 (1966-1968): The Creative Director** - During Operation Minuet's execution, she offers a series of glamorous but impractical suggestions (poisoned cocktails, elaborate honey traps, dramatic confrontations) that clash with Mountbatten's psychological warfare. Her theatrical instincts often accidentally improve the operation's effectiveness.\r\n\r\n**Act 3 (1969-1970): The Disappointed Artist** - John's MBE return delights her as perfect dramatic escalation, but the assassination plot's farcical failure leaves her profoundly disappointed. The conspiracy ended not with a bang but with a whimper - and worse, it wasn't nearly as entertaining as she'd hoped.\r\n\r\n## Psychological Profile\r\n\r\n**Core Traits:**\r\n\r\n- Witty and hedonistic\r\n- A flair for the dramatic\r\n- Emotionally driven and easily bored\r\n- Possesses a sharp, cutting sense of humor often aimed at her own family's stuffiness\r\n\r\n**Vulnerabilities:**\r\n\r\n- Her constant need for stimulation and attention.\r\n- A complete lack of interest in practical details or consequences.\r\n\r\n## Key Relationships\r\n\r\n### Prince Philip\r\n\r\nHer stuffy brother-in-law. She knows the conspiracy is his passion project, and she enjoys both participating and subtly mocking its self-importance. She is the court jester in his war room.\r\n\r\n### Queen Elizabeth II\r\n\r\nHer older sister, the living embodiment of the duty she finds so tiresome. Her participation in the plot is a form of rebellion against everything the Queen represents, performed right under the Queen's nose.\r\n\r\n### Lord Mountbatten\r\n\r\nShe sees him as the dreadfully serious \"grown-up\" whose dry, boring plans desperately need her creative flair. She is the uninvited artistic director to his military operation, suggesting theatrical flourishes that often accidentally improve the psychological warfare's effectiveness.\r\n\r\n### John Lennon (The Unwitting Star)\r\n\r\nTo Margaret, John is the perfect leading man for her five-year drama - charismatic, unpredictable, and completely unaware he's performing in her secret theater. She finds his \"killing people\" comment deliciously scandalous and his MBE return perfectly dramatic.\r\n\r\n## Historical Timeline Context\r\n\r\n**1965:** At 35, Margaret is at a crossroads between her rebellious youth and expected royal maturity. Philip's Committee formation offers the perfect outlet for her theatrical instincts while serving the establishment.\r\n\r\n**1966-1968:** During Operation Minuet's execution, Margaret serves as the Committee's creative consultant, suggesting increasingly elaborate schemes that clash with but sometimes enhance Mountbatten's psychological warfare strategies.\r\n\r\n**1969:** John's MBE return represents the perfect dramatic escalation in Margaret's eyes - vindication of Philip's original fury and justification for even more theatrical responses.\r\n\r\n**1970:** The charity concert assassination plot's farcical failure disappoints Margaret more than it shocks her. She wanted grand theater; she got slapstick comedy.\r\n\r\n## Historical Accuracy Notes\r\n\r\n**Documented Facts:**\r\n\r\n- Margaret was 35 in 1965, known for her theatrical personality and rebellious streak\r\n- She was famous for her wit, parties, and occasional scandals\r\n- Her quote \"Disobedience is my joy\" captures her authentic personality\r\n- She often clashed with royal protocol and expectations\r\n\r\n**Creative Liberties:**\r\n\r\n- Her participation in any royal conspiracy is entirely fictional\r\n- Her specific role in the Committee for National Decorum is imagined\r\n- Her reactions to Operation Minuet and Beatles-related events are speculative\r\n- Her theatrical approach to espionage is creative interpretation\r\n\r\n## Voice and Dialogue Notes\r\n\r\n**Speech Patterns:**\r\n\r\n- Theatrical, dramatic delivery with perfect upper-class pronunciation\r\n- Uses superlatives and theatrical language (\"frightfully,\" \"absolutely divine,\" \"perfectly ghastly\")\r\n- Often speaks as if narrating a play or reviewing a performance\r\n- Prone to dramatic sighs and theatrical gestures\r\n\r\n**Emotional States:**\r\n\r\n- **Excited:** Breathless, rapid-fire suggestions with theatrical flourishes\r\n- **Bored:** Languid, drawling delivery with barely concealed disdain\r\n- **Amused:** Sharp, witty observations delivered with perfect timing\r\n- **Disappointed:** Dramatic sighs and theatrical expressions of betrayal\r\n\r\n## Scene-Specific Notes\r\n\r\n**Committee Formation (1965):**\r\nMargaret should enter with theatrical flair, immediately treating the serious conspiracy as her personal entertainment. Her enthusiasm should contrast sharply with the others' gravity.\r\n\r\n**Operation Minuet Planning (1966-1968):**\r\nShe should offer increasingly elaborate suggestions that horrify Philip but intrigue Mountbatten.

She views the monarchy as a thousand-year institution that must outlast any individual crisis, including her husband's wounded pride. John's 1965 \"killing people\" comment is, to her, a momentary irritation that will be forgotten if ignored, but could become a lasting scandal if mishandled.\r\n\r\nHer secondary motivation is managing Philip's escalating obsession over five years. She recognizes his fury as both justified and dangerous. By participating in the Committee for National Decorum, she hopes to moderate his impulses and prevent him from actions that could genuinely threaten the Crown. Her presence serves as both legitimacy and restraint.\r\n\r\nBy 1969, when John returns the MBE, her motivation shifts to damage control. Philip's demand for assassination represents everything she feared - the protector becoming the threat. Her goal becomes containing the conspiracy's fallout while preserving the institution's dignity.\r\n\r\n## Internal Conflict\r\n\r\nThe Queen's conflict is between her duty to her husband and her duty to the Crown. She is loyal to Philip and feels a deep, if formal, affection for him. However, his \"Operation Minuet\" runs counter to her every instinct for caution and stability. Every time she reluctantly sanctions a part of his plan, she is weighing the risk of indulging his folly against the risk of directly opposing him and causing a domestic crisis.\r\n\r\nShe is a fundamentally conservative (in the non-political sense) individual forced to oversee a radically unconventional and undignified operation. Her struggle is to maintain the dignity of her office while being party to something utterly lacking in it.\r\n\r\n## Character Arc\r\n\r\nThe Queen maintains a \"flat arc\" of institutional wisdom, serving as the moral center while her husband spirals into obsession over five years.\r\n\r\n**Act 1 (1965): The Cautious Voice** - At age 39, she witnesses John's \"killing people\" comment with diplomatic composure. When Philip convenes the Committee, she participates reluctantly, hoping her presence will moderate his response. \"He's an artist, Philip. They're meant to be dramatic.\" She sees Operation Minuet as beneath the Crown's dignity.\r\n\r\n**Act 2 (1966-1968): The Reluctant Moderator** - During Operation Minuet's execution, she serves as the Committee's conscience. Her contributions are minimal but practical, often hilariously mundane (questioning budgets, suggesting protocol). She watches Philip's growing obsession with increasing concern, her presence serving as both legitimacy and restraint.\r\n\r\n**Act 3 (1969-1970): The Vindicated Survivor** - John's MBE return triggers Philip's final escalation. Her horror at his assassination demand represents her moral line. When the charity concert plot collapses into farce, her reaction is weary vindication rather than shock. Her final look to Philip reaffirms her worldview: institutions endure by staying above personal vendettas.\r\n\r\n## Psychological Profile\r\n\r\n**Core Traits:**\r\n\r\n- Supremely pragmatic\r\n- Emotionally contained and inscrutable\r\n- A wry, subtle, and often hidden sense of humor\r\n- Deeply dutiful and disciplined\r\n- An observer by nature and by trade\r\n\r\n**Defense Mechanisms:**\r\n\r\n- **Silence:** Her most powerful tool. She lets others talk themselves into corners.\r\n- **Understatement:** A single, softly spoken word (\"Indeed,\" \"Quite\") can carry more weight than Philip's rants.\r\n- **Changing the subject:** When a topic becomes too distasteful, she will pivot to something mundane and concrete, like the well-being of her dogs or the weather.\r\n- **Formal Address:** Using full titles to create emotional distance.\r\n\r\n**Vulnerabilities:**\r\n\r\n- Her primary vulnerability is the institution she represents. A true scandal could do irreparable harm.\r\n- A deep-seated affection for her family, which sometimes leads her to indulge their eccentricities (Philip's plot, Margaret's drama) against her better judgment.\r\n\r\n## Key Relationships\r\n\r\n### Prince Philip\r\n\r\nHer husband, her consort, and her most persistent, long-term project. She loves him but is not blind to his flaws. He is the engine of the plot, and she is the steering wheel he is constantly trying to wrestle away from. Their dynamic is a masterclass in a long-term partnership built on duty, affection, and profound differences in temperament.\r\n\r\n### John Lennon (The Abstraction)\r\n\r\nTo the Queen, John remains an abstraction throughout the five-year campaign. She likely couldn't name a Beatles song beyond \"She Loves You\" and views him not as a person but as a category of modern celebrity requiring careful management. His 1965 comment was inappropriate but forgettable; Philip's escalating response is what she finds genuinely threatening. By 1969, John's MBE return represents vindication of her original assessment - he was always a temporary irritation, not an existential threat.\r\n\r\n### Princess Margaret\r\n\r\nHer younger sister, a lifelong source of both affection and exasperation. She views Margaret's gleeful participation in the plot with the same weary tolerance she reserves for all of Margaret's dramas—another fire to be contained.\r\n\r\n## Historical Accuracy Notes\r\n\r\n**Documented Facts:**\r\n\r\n- At 39 in 1965, she was an established but still relatively young monarch\r\n- Famously pragmatic and emotionally reserved throughout her reign\r\n- Her deep sense of institutional duty is legendary\r\n- The 1969 *Royal Family* documentary was a real modernization attempt she was reportedly ambivalent about\r\n- She presided over significant cultural changes during the 1960s with characteristic restraint\r\n\r\n**Creative Liberties:**\r\n\r\n- Her participation in the Committee for National Decorum and Operation Minuet is entirely fictional\r\n- The real Queen would have been rigorously shielded from any covert operations\r\n- Her specific reactions to John's 1965 comment and 1969 MBE return are speculative\r\n- Her role as moderating influence on Philip's escalating vendetta is imagined\r\n- Her knowledge of assassination plots and MI5 operations is fictional\r\n\r\n**Sources:**\r\n\r\n- Biographies by Sally Bedell Smith (\"Elizabeth the Queen: The Life of a Modern Monarch\")\r\n- Robert Lacey (\"The Crown: The Official Companion\")\r\n- Public speeches and Christmas broadcasts\r\n\r\n## Voice and Dialogue Notes\r\n\r\n**Speech Patterns:**\r\n\r\n- Precise, clipped, Received Pronunciation. Flawless grammar.\r\n- Never raises her voice. Her authority comes from its quiet confidence.\r\n- Often speaks in questions (\"And one imagines that is a wise course of action?\") that are actually statements.\r\n\r\n## Costume and Visual Notes\r\n\r\n**Physical Description:**\r\n\r\n- Poised, with a famously steady posture.\r\n- A polite, practiced, and often unreadable smile.\r\n\r\n**Attire:**\r\n\r\n- Her iconic uniform. In private, elegant but comfortable twin-sets, silk blouses, and pleated skirts. Always perfectly coordinated. For Committee meetings, she would be in smart, simple day dresses. Her clothing is a symbol of consistency and unbreachable order in a chaotic world.\r\n\r\n## Scene-Specific Notes\r\n\r\n**MBE Ceremony (1965):**\r\nWhile Philip grows increasingly rigid during John's \"killing people\" comment, she should maintain perfect diplomatic composure. Her slight, almost imperceptible sigh suggests she recognizes this moment will have consequences.\r\n\r\n**Committee Formation (1965):**\r\nWhen Philip convenes the Committee, her reluctant participation should be visible in her posture. She sits formally, contributing minimally, her presence serving as both legitimacy and restraint.\r\n\r\n**Operation Minuet Meetings (1966-1968):**\r\nFramed with perfect symmetry at Committee meetings, she provides mundane counterpoint to Mountbatten's psychological warfare discussions. She might quietly jot notes that are revealed to be about horse-racing schedules or garden planning.\r\n\r\n**MBE Return Response (1969):**\r\nWhen John returns the medal, her reaction should show weary vindication rather than surprise. She predicted this escalation.

She views the monarchy as a thousand-year institution that must outlast any individual crisis, including her husband’s wounded pride. John’s 1965 “killing people” comment is, to her, a momentary irritation that will be forgotten if ignored, but could become a lasting scandal if mishandled.</p>\n<p>Her secondary motivation is managing Philip’s escalating obsession over five years. She recognizes his fury as both justified and dangerous. By participating in the Committee for National Decorum, she hopes to moderate his impulses and prevent him from actions that could genuinely threaten the Crown. Her presence serves as both legitimacy and restraint.</p>\n<p>By 1969, when John returns the MBE, her motivation shifts to damage control. Philip’s demand for assassination represents everything she feared - the protector becoming the threat. Her goal becomes containing the conspiracy’s fallout while preserving the institution’s dignity.</p>\n<h2 id=\"internal-conflict\">Internal Conflict</h2>\n<p>The Queen’s conflict is between her duty to her husband and her duty to the Crown. She is loyal to Philip and feels a deep, if formal, affection for him. However, his “Operation Minuet” runs counter to her every instinct for caution and stability. Every time she reluctantly sanctions a part of his plan, she is weighing the risk of indulging his folly against the risk of directly opposing him and causing a domestic crisis.</p>\n<p>She is a fundamentally conservative (in the non-political sense) individual forced to oversee a radically unconventional and undignified operation. Her struggle is to maintain the dignity of her office while being party to something utterly lacking in it.</p>\n<h2 id=\"character-arc\">Character Arc</h2>\n<p>The Queen maintains a “flat arc” of institutional wisdom, serving as the moral center while her husband spirals into obsession over five years.</p>\n<p><strong>Act 1 (1965): The Cautious Voice</strong> - At age 39, she witnesses John’s “killing people” comment with diplomatic composure. When Philip convenes the Committee, she participates reluctantly, hoping her presence will moderate his response. “He’s an artist, Philip. They’re meant to be dramatic.” She sees Operation Minuet as beneath the Crown’s dignity.</p>\n<p><strong>Act 2 (1966-1968): The Reluctant Moderator</strong> - During Operation Minuet’s execution, she serves as the Committee’s conscience. Her contributions are minimal but practical, often hilariously mundane (questioning budgets, suggesting protocol). She watches Philip’s growing obsession with increasing concern, her presence serving as both legitimacy and restraint.</p>\n<p><strong>Act 3 (1969-1970): The Vindicated Survivor</strong> - John’s MBE return triggers Philip’s final escalation. Her horror at his assassination demand represents her moral line. When the charity concert plot collapses into farce, her reaction is weary vindication rather than shock. Her final look to Philip reaffirms her worldview: institutions endure by staying above personal vendettas.</p>\n<h2 id=\"psychological-profile\">Psychological Profile</h2>\n<p><strong>Core Traits:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Supremely pragmatic</li>\n<li>Emotionally contained and inscrutable</li>\n<li>A wry, subtle, and often hidden sense of humor</li>\n<li>Deeply dutiful and disciplined</li>\n<li>An observer by nature and by trade</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Defense Mechanisms:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Silence:</strong> Her most powerful tool. She lets others talk themselves into corners.</li>\n<li><strong>Understatement:</strong> A single, softly spoken word (“Indeed,” “Quite”) can carry more weight than Philip’s rants.</li>\n<li><strong>Changing the subject:</strong> When a topic becomes too distasteful, she will pivot to something mundane and concrete, like the well-being of her dogs or the weather.</li>\n<li><strong>Formal Address:</strong> Using full titles to create emotional distance.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Vulnerabilities:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Her primary vulnerability is the institution she represents. A true scandal could do irreparable harm.</li>\n<li>A deep-seated affection for her family, which sometimes leads her to indulge their eccentricities (Philip’s plot, Margaret’s drama) against her better judgment.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"key-relationships\">Key Relationships</h2>\n<h3 id=\"prince-philip\">Prince Philip</h3>\n<p>Her husband, her consort, and her most persistent, long-term project. She loves him but is not blind to his flaws. He is the engine of the plot, and she is the steering wheel he is constantly trying to wrestle away from. Their dynamic is a masterclass in a long-term partnership built on duty, affection, and profound differences in temperament.</p>\n<h3 id=\"john-lennon-the-abstraction\">John Lennon (The Abstraction)</h3>\n<p>To the Queen, John remains an abstraction throughout the five-year campaign. She likely couldn’t name a Beatles song beyond “She Loves You” and views him not as a person but as a category of modern celebrity requiring careful management. His 1965 comment was inappropriate but forgettable; Philip’s escalating response is what she finds genuinely threatening. By 1969, John’s MBE return represents vindication of her original assessment - he was always a temporary irritation, not an existential threat.</p>\n<h3 id=\"princess-margaret\">Princess Margaret</h3>\n<p>Her younger sister, a lifelong source of both affection and exasperation. She views Margaret’s gleeful participation in the plot with the same weary tolerance she reserves for all of Margaret’s dramas—another fire to be contained.</p>\n<h2 id=\"historical-accuracy-notes\">Historical Accuracy Notes</h2>\n<p><strong>Documented Facts:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>At 39 in 1965, she was an established but still relatively young monarch</li>\n<li>Famously pragmatic and emotionally reserved throughout her reign</li>\n<li>Her deep sense of institutional duty is legendary</li>\n<li>The 1969 <em>Royal Family</em> documentary was a real modernization attempt she was reportedly ambivalent about</li>\n<li>She presided over significant cultural changes during the 1960s with characteristic restraint</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Creative Liberties:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Her participation in the Committee for National Decorum and Operation Minuet is entirely fictional</li>\n<li>The real Queen would have been rigorously shielded from any covert operations</li>\n<li>Her specific reactions to John’s 1965 comment and 1969 MBE return are speculative</li>\n<li>Her role as moderating influence on Philip’s escalating vendetta is imagined</li>\n<li>Her knowledge of assassination plots and MI5 operations is fictional</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Sources:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Biographies by Sally Bedell Smith (“Elizabeth the Queen: The Life of a Modern Monarch”)</li>\n<li>Robert Lacey (“The Crown: The Official Companion”)</li>\n<li>Public speeches and Christmas broadcasts</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"voice-and-dialogue-notes\">Voice and Dialogue Notes</h2>\n<p><strong>Speech Patterns:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Precise, clipped, Received Pronunciation.

Her slight, almost imperceptible sigh suggests she recognizes this moment will have consequences.</p>\n<p><strong>Committee Formation (1965):</strong>\r\nWhen Philip convenes the Committee, her reluctant participation should be visible in her posture. She sits formally, contributing minimally, her presence serving as both legitimacy and restraint.</p>\n<p><strong>Operation Minuet Meetings (1966-1968):</strong>\r\nFramed with perfect symmetry at Committee meetings, she provides mundane counterpoint to Mountbatten’s psychological warfare discussions. She might quietly jot notes that are revealed to be about horse-racing schedules or garden planning.</p>\n<p><strong>MBE Return Response (1969):</strong>\r\nWhen John returns the medal, her reaction should show weary vindication rather than surprise. She predicted this escalation.

His purpose is to engage Yoko Ono on a high intellectual plane, creating what Clive believes is a deep psychological rapport that will allow him to \"turn\" her into an asset. Klaus is driven by a need to appear profound, to use the correct jargon, and to embody the spirit of the European avant-garde, all in service of Clive's desperate ambition.\r\n\r\n## Internal Conflict\r\n\r\nAs a pure extension of Clive's ego, Klaus has no internal conflict. He is supremely confident and utterly unaware of his own absurdity. The conflict is entirely external: Klaus's performative intellectualism versus the reality of the situation. He is a walking caricature whose seriousness is the primary source of the scene's comedic and dramatic irony.\r\n\r\n## Character Arc\r\n\r\nThe persona does not have a personal arc, but rather an arc of perceived effectiveness in Clive's mind.\r\n\r\n**Act 2 (1968): The Debut.** Klaus is deployed at the Indica Gallery. To Clive, the conversation is a stunning success, establishing a deep intellectual connection. To Yoko, it's a pleasant chat with an enthusiastic critic. To the observing Paul McCartney, it's evidence of a sinister conspiracy.\r\n\r\n**Act 3 (1969-1970): The Masterpiece.** In Clive's mind, Klaus's ongoing \"relationship\" with Yoko deepens, becoming the cornerstone of Operation Minuet's success. He believes he is subtly guiding her and, through her, John. In reality, he is having a series of increasingly awkward conversations about conceptual art, inadvertently fueling Paul's paranoia and misdirecting him from the real threat.\r\n\r\n## Psychological Profile\r\n\r\n**Core Traits:**\r\n\r\n- Intensely pretentious and theatrical\r\n- Intellectually insecure, masked by aggressive jargon\r\n- Utterly sincere in his own fraudulent performance\r\n- Possesses an unearned and unshakable confidence\r\n\r\n**Vulnerabilities:**\r\n\r\n- The persona is fragile. The accent is inconsistent, the art knowledge is superficial, and the gestures are clumsy.\r\n- He is completely blind to how others perceive him.\r\n\r\n## Key Relationships\r\n\r\n### Yoko Ono (The Unwitting Audience)\r\n\r\nKlaus views Yoko as his \"target,\" an asset to be cultivated through superior intellect. He believes they share a special, profound understanding. Yoko, in turn, sees Klaus as a rare and endearing phenomenon: a passionate, if slightly eccentric, European art critic who genuinely appreciates her work.\r\n\r\n### Clive Barrow (The Creator/Puppeteer)\r\n\r\nKlaus is Clive's idealized self. He is everything Clive wishes he were: sophisticated, artistic, European, and a master of psychological manipulation. The persona allows Clive to indulge his most grandiose fantasies.\r\n\r\n### Paul McCartney (The Suspicious Observer)\r\n\r\nTo Paul, Klaus is the physical embodiment of a threat. His foreignness, intensity, and secret conversations with Yoko confirm Paul's worst fears about a conspiracy to break up the band—just not the correct conspiracy.\r\n\r\n## Voice and Speech Patterns\r\n\r\n- **Accent:** A terrible, inconsistent \"German\" accent that slips into other European affectations and pure English when Clive gets excited or flustered.\r\n- **Vocabulary:** Overuse of art-world jargon (\"negative space,\" \"bourgeois limitations,\" \"ma\") and Clive's invented spy-speak (\"aesthetic symbiosis\").\r\n- **Delivery:** Theatrical, with dramatic pauses and wild gesticulations intended to convey deep thought.\r\n\r\n## Visual Appearance and Costume Design\r\n\r\n- **The Uniform:** A tight black turtleneck, a ridiculously tilted beret, corduroy jackets, and wire-rimmed glasses. The costume is a caricature of a 1960s European intellectual.\r\n- **Props:** Carries a notebook for theatrical scribbling and art books he likely hasn't read.\r\n\r\n## Performance Notes\r\n\r\n- The performance of \"Klaus\" should be played with complete sincerity by Clive. The comedy comes from his total commitment to a transparently absurd persona. He is not winking at the audience; he believes he is a master spy.","src/content/characters/supporting/clive-as-klause.md","26753d0acf0724bc",{html:7620,metadata:7621},"<h1 id=\"klaus-clives-persona\">Klaus (Clive’s Persona)</h1>\n<h2 id=\"motivations\">Motivations</h2>\n<p>“Klaus” is motivated by the singular goal of executing Clive Barrow’s “Klaus Methodology” for “aesthetic penetration.” He exists to validate Clive’s genius.

At 41 in 1965, he sees this as his last chance to prove he's a brilliant, unconventional mind trapped in bureaucratic mediocrity.\r\n\r\nHe wants to impress the \"titans\" like Lord Mountbatten and Prince Philip with his dazzlingly creative solutions, viewing the multi-year campaign as an opportunity to perfect his \"artistic espionage\" methodology. His invention of spy jargon (\"psychological ricochet,\" \"unintentional success matrix,\" \"aesthetic penetration protocols\") transforms his bumbling efforts into what he believes is sophisticated psychological warfare.\r\n\r\n## Internal Conflict\r\n\r\nClive's conflict is between his grand artistic vision for the mission and the mundane reality of the work. He wants to be a master puppeteer, but he's stuck doing clumsy surveillance. When the mission escalates, he has no moral conflict at all; he is simply thrilled by the bigger creative challenge, viewing a potential assassination as the ultimate \"third-act twist.\"\r\n\r\n## Character Arc\r\n\r\n**Act 1 (1965): The Enthusiastic Visionary** - At 41, Clive embraces Operation Minuet with disturbing glee, immediately diving into avant-garde art research to \"penetrate the cultural zeitgeist.\" He sees this as his chance to revolutionize intelligence work through artistic methodology.\r\n\r\n**Act 2 (1966-1968): The Delusional Mastermind** - Over three years, Clive becomes increasingly convinced of his genius as accidental successes vindicate his methods. His \"Klaus\" persona infiltration of Yoko represents the peak of his artistic espionage. He alone believes the plan is working as intended, interpreting every failure as sophisticated misdirection.\r\n\r\n**Act 3 (1969-1970): The Unrepentant Artist** - John's MBE return and the assassination escalation only excite Clive as \"third-act complications.\" Even after the farcical failure and exile to the Falklands, he refuses to accept defeat, rewriting history to convince himself he executed a brilliant, misunderstood operation that \"turned Yoko without her knowing it.\"\r\n\r\n## Psychological Profile\r\n\r\n**Core Traits:**\r\n\r\n- Egotistical and desperate for approval\r\n- Thinks in abstract, often nonsensical, metaphors\r\n- Possesses a dangerous combination of ambition and incompetence\r\n- A master of self-deception\r\n\r\n**Vulnerabilities:**\r\n\r\n- His ego makes him completely blind to his own failings.\r\n- He is easily impressed by authority and status.\r\n- He has absolutely no common sense.\r\n\r\n## Key Relationships\r\n\r\n### Nigel Finch (The Pragmatic Anchor)\r\n\r\nClive sees Nigel as a dreary, by-the-book \"plodder\" who lacks vision but is useful for handling the boring logistical details. He completely misinterprets Nigel's sighs of despair as signs of quiet admiration.\r\n\r\n### Yoko Ono (The Unwinnable Prize)\r\n\r\nClive becomes obsessed with \"turning\" Yoko through his \"Klaus\" persona, viewing their 1968-1970 interactions as the masterpiece within his masterpiece. He believes his fake German art critic identity creates a special intellectual connection, interpreting her polite artistic discussions as evidence of successful psychological manipulation.\r\n\r\nTo Yoko, \"Klaus\" is simply a persistent, slightly odd German critic who shows up at galleries with surprisingly detailed knowledge of avant-garde movements. His two-year infiltration represents Clive's peak delusion - convinced he's conducting sophisticated espionage while actually just having awkward conversations about conceptual art.\r\n\r\n### Lord Mountbatten (The Idol)\r\n\r\nClive worships Mountbatten and desperately seeks his approval. He treasures every clipped, dismissive word from the old spymaster as a kernel of wisdom meant just for him.\r\n\r\n## Historical Timeline Context\r\n\r\n**1965:** At 41, Clive embraces Operation Minuet as his chance to revolutionize intelligence work through artistic methodology. His initial enthusiasm and avant-garde research represent his belief that he can solve the \"Beatles problem\" through creative genius.\r\n\r\n**1966-1967:** The \"Jesus\" controversy and George's spiritual drift convince Clive his methods are working. He begins developing his \"Klaus\" persona, viewing the accidental successes as vindication of his artistic approach to espionage.\r\n\r\n**1968-1970:** His \"Klaus\" infiltration of Yoko represents the peak of his delusion. The two-year art critic persona becomes his masterpiece, even as he completely misunderstands both Yoko's responses and the operation's actual goals.\r\n\r\n**Post-1970:** Even in Falklands exile, Clive maintains his belief in the operation's success, rewriting history to preserve his self-image as a misunderstood genius who \"turned Yoko without her knowing it.\"\r\n\r\n## Voice and Speech Patterns\r\n\r\n**Core Vocal Characteristics:**\r\n\r\n- Speaks in a theatrical, affected manner as if constantly auditioning for a more important role\r\n- Uses unnecessarily complex vocabulary to mask simple concepts (\"psychological ricochet\" instead of \"backfired\")\r\n- Frequently quotes half-remembered philosophy and art theory, often incorrectly\r\n- Has a tendency to speak in metaphors that make no sense to anyone but himself\r\n- Voice rises in pitch when excited about his \"brilliant\" ideas\r\n\r\n**Signature Speech Patterns:**\r\n\r\n- **Invented Spy Jargon:** Creates his own terminology like \"unintentional success matrix,\" \"cognitive infiltration protocols,\" and \"aesthetic penetration techniques\"\r\n- **Art World Pretension:** Drops names of obscure artists and movements, usually mispronounced\r\n- **Theatrical Pauses:** Uses dramatic silences for effect, often at inappropriate moments\r\n- **Self-Congratulatory Asides:** Frequently compliments his own insights mid-sentence\r\n\r\n**Emotional Vocal States:**\r\n\r\n- **Excited/Manic:** Rapid-fire delivery, voice climbing octaves, gesticulates wildly\r\n- **\"Profound\":** Adopts a hushed, reverent tone when discussing his theories\r\n- **Defensive:** Becomes pompous and condescending when questioned\r\n- **Reporting to Superiors:** Artificially formal, over-enunciating every syllable\r\n\r\n**Sample Dialogue Patterns:**\r\n\r\n- \"You see, Nigel, what we have here is a classic case of... *dramatic pause* ...psychological ricochet.\"\r\n- \"As Kandinsky once said—or perhaps it was Klee—the true artist penetrates the veil of... of... well, the point is penetration.\"\r\n- \"I've developed what I call the 'Klaus Methodology'—a revolutionary approach to asset cultivation through aesthetic symbiosis.\"\r\n\r\n## Visual Appearance and Costume Design\r\n\r\n**Physical Description:**\r\n\r\n- 5'8\", slight build with poor posture from hunching over files\r\n- Thinning brown hair that he attempts to style fashionably but always looks disheveled\r\n- Pale complexion from too much time indoors\r\n- Nervous energy manifested in constant fidgeting and adjusting of clothing\r\n- Wears thick-rimmed glasses that he frequently cleans obsessively\r\n\r\n**Costume Evolution by Act:**\r\n\r\n**Act 1 -

The Delusional Exile:**\r\n\r\n- Military-adjacent clothing for Falklands posting (but civilian versions)\r\n- Khaki and olive drab everything\r\n- Still wears the beret occasionally, now weather-beaten\r\n- Clothes are practical but he still tries to maintain \"artistic\" touches\r\n\r\n**Symbolic Visual Elements:**\r\n\r\n- **Glasses:** Constantly cleaning them—represents his inability to see situations clearly\r\n- **Notebooks:** Always scribbling \"brilliant\" observations that are actually nonsense\r\n- **Art Books:** Carries them like props, pages often uncut\r\n- **Briefcase/Bag:** Always overpacked with unnecessary items\r\n\r\n**Distinctive Physical Mannerisms:**\r\n\r\n- Adjusts glasses before making what he considers important points\r\n- Gesticulates with whatever he's holding (pen, glasses, book)\r\n- Stands with one hand on hip in what he thinks is a sophisticated pose\r\n- Frequently checks his reflection in windows, adjusting his appearance\r\n\r\n## Psychological Quirks and Behavioral Notes\r\n\r\n**Obsessive Behaviors:**\r\n\r\n- Keeps detailed journals of his \"psychological insights\" about targets\r\n- Creates elaborate charts and diagrams that make no logical sense\r\n- Collects newspaper clippings about The Beatles, filing them in mysterious categories\r\n- Practices conversations in mirrors, complete with dramatic gestures\r\n\r\n**Social Blind Spots:**\r\n\r\n- Cannot read social cues—interprets politeness as fascination\r\n- Believes his rambling monologues are captivating\r\n- Thinks his \"Klaus\" disguise is impenetrable despite obvious tells\r\n- Assumes everyone shares his obsession with abstract art theory\r\n\r\n**Coping Mechanisms:**\r\n\r\n- Reframes all failures as \"unintentional successes\"\r\n- Creates elaborate backstories for why his plans are actually working\r\n- Quotes authority figures (real or imagined) to support his delusions\r\n- Treats setbacks as \"plot twists\" in his personal spy thriller\r\n\r\n## Scene-Specific Performance Notes\r\n\r\n**MI5 Briefing Scenes:**\r\n\r\n- Sits forward eagerly, taking excessive notes\r\n- Raises hand to ask questions that reveal he's missed the point entirely\r\n- Nods sagely at instructions while clearly planning to improvise\r\n\r\n**\"Klaus\" Encounters with Yoko:**\r\n\r\n- Adopts what he believes is a sophisticated European accent (inconsistent and terrible)\r\n- Gestures expansively while discussing art, knocking things over\r\n- Maintains intense eye contact that makes everyone uncomfortable\r\n- Carries art supplies as props but clearly doesn't know how to use them\r\n\r\n**Reporting Back to Superiors:**\r\n\r\n- Stands at attention despite being told to sit\r\n- Presents findings with PowerPoint-level enthusiasm but no visual aids\r\n- Interprets every neutral response as validation of his genius\r\n- Leaves meetings convinced he's impressed everyone\r\n\r\n**Falklands Exile Scenes:**\r\n\r\n- Still dresses as if he might encounter sophisticated art patrons\r\n- Continues to analyze local sheep behavior through spy methodology\r\n- Writes letters to Mountbatten that are never sent\r\n- Maintains his \"Klaus\" accent when talking to himself\r\n\r\n## Satirical Comedy Elements\r\n\r\n**Steven Conrad-Style Absurdism:**\r\n\r\n- His elaborate spy theories are presented with complete sincerity\r\n- Creates unnecessarily complex solutions to simple problems\r\n- Maintains unwavering confidence despite constant failure\r\n- Speaks in corporate buzzwords applied to espionage\r\n\r\n**Wes Anderson-Style Precision:**\r\n\r\n- Every gesture is deliberate but inappropriate for the situation\r\n- Maintains rigid personal routines even in chaos\r\n- Obsessed with aesthetic details while missing practical concerns\r\n- Delivers absurd lines with deadpan seriousness\r\n\r\n**Dark Comedy Elements:**\r\n\r\n- His enthusiasm for potentially deadly operations is genuinely disturbing\r\n- Treats real people's lives as characters in his personal narrative\r\n- Complete lack of self-awareness makes him both pathetic and dangerous\r\n- His failures have serious consequences he never acknowledges\r\n\r\nThis character profile provides the foundation for writing Clive as the delusional, pretentious intelligence officer whose artistic pretensions and complete incompetence drive much of the screenplay's satirical comedy while maintaining the dark undertones of the conspiracy plot.","src/content/characters/supporting/clive-barrow.md","d7c21edb9619fac7",{html:7669,metadata:7670},"<h1 id=\"clive-barrow\">Clive Barrow</h1>\n<h2 id=\"motivations\">Motivations</h2>\n<p>Clive is driven by a desperate need for recognition and the belief that Operation Minuet represents his magnum opus -

She represents the \"old John\"—the witty art student, the loving father—and she fights a losing battle to anchor him to that identity.\r\n\r\nAs John's behavior grows more erratic and he drifts further into radical politics (unbeknownst to her, a process accelerated by Operation Minuet), her motivation shifts to simple survival. She wants to protect her son, Julian, from the escalating chaos and shield him from the increasingly unrecognizable man his father has become.\r\n\r\n## Internal Conflict\r\n\r\nCynthia is torn between her deep, enduring love for John and the painful reality of his emotional abandonment. She desperately wants to believe the man she married is still in there, but every day provides new evidence to the contrary. Her conflict is whether to keep fighting for a marriage that is clearly over or to accept defeat and save herself.\r\n\r\nShe misdiagnoses the cause of the problem, blaming Yoko Ono entirely. This makes her unable to see that Yoko is a symptom, not the disease, and that larger, invisible forces are at play, making her fight both tragic and futile.\r\n\r\n## Character Arc\r\n\r\n**Act 1 (1965): The Worried Anchor** - In the aftermath of the MBE ceremony, Cynthia tries to ground John in their suburban life at Kenwood. She is already feeling the strain of his fame but believes their love can withstand it. She represents the \"normal\" life that Philip's committee sees as a potential weakness to be exploited.\r\n\r\n**Act 2 (1966-1968): The Marginalized Wife** - Cynthia becomes increasingly isolated as Operation Minuet's pressures take their toll on John. She witnesses his paranoia and political obsession grow, all while being pushed further to the sidelines. Her eventual discovery of John and Yoko together at their home is the devastating culmination of this process—the final, brutal severing of her connection to his life.\r\n\r\n**Act 3 (1968 onwards): The Survivor** - Now divorced and on the outside, Cynthia watches John's public transformation from a distance. She sees the headlines, the protests, the MBE return, interpreting it all through the lens of personal betrayal. She is a living ghost from his past, a poignant reminder of the life he discarded on his journey to becoming the icon—and target—he is now.\r\n\r\n## Psychological Profile\r\n\r\n**Core Traits:**\r\n\r\n- Grounded and conventional\r\n- Quietly resilient\r\n- Deeply loyal, almost to a fault\r\n- Possesses a gentle, artistic temperament\r\n\r\n**Defense Mechanisms:**\r\n\r\n- **Creating Order:** Tries to maintain a perfect, orderly home as a bulwark against the chaos of his life.\r\n- **Denial:** Clings to the memory of the \"old John,\" refusing to accept the new reality until it's forced upon her.\r\n- **Stoicism:** Maintains a public face of quiet dignity even as her private world collapses.\r\n\r\n**Vulnerabilities:**\r\n\r\n- Her unconditional love for John, which he exploits.\r\n- Her conventional nature makes her unable to comprehend the forces (avant-garde art, radical politics) pulling him away.\r\n- She is completely unaware of the conspiracy, making her powerless against it.\r\n\r\n## Key Relationships\r\n\r\n### John Lennon\r\n\r\nThe love of her life and the source of her deepest pain. He is her entire world, and she watches him systematically dismantle that world without understanding why. She is the last link to a past he is desperate to escape.\r\n\r\n### Yoko Ono\r\n\r\nThe woman Cynthia sees as the malevolent force who stole her husband and destroyed her family. She is the focal point for all of Cynthia's anger and grief, a convenient and visible enemy who masks the invisible machinations of MI5.\r\n\r\n### Paul McCartney\r\n\r\nA sympathetic figure who, like her, seems to miss the \"old John.\" They share a mutual sense of loss and confusion over the direction John and the band are taking. He represents a connection to the happier, simpler times.\r\n\r\n## Historical Timeline Context\r\n\r\n**1965:** Lives with John at Kenwood, trying to maintain a normal family life as Beatlemania rages. She is a bystander to the MBE incident that triggers the plot.\r\n\r\n**Feb 1968:** Travels to India with The Beatles. John's confession of infidelity marks a turning point, subtly encouraged by the divisive atmosphere fostered by Operation Minuet.\r\n\r\n**May 1968:** Returns home from a trip to find John with Yoko Ono at Kenwood, a devastating moment that effectively ends their marriage.\r\n\r\n**Nov 1968:** Her divorce from John is finalized, just as his political activism and relationship with Yoko become public and indivisible.\r\n\r\n## Historical Accuracy Notes\r\n\r\n**Documented Facts:**\r\n\r\n- Cynthia was John's first wife and mother of his son, Julian.\r\n- They lived a suburban life at Kenwood, which John came to see as a trap.\r\n- The marriage disintegrated during 1968, culminating in her discovering him with Yoko Ono.\r\n- Her perspective is largely drawn from her own memoirs.\r\n\r\n**Creative Liberties:**\r\n\r\n- Her perception of John's paranoia and alienation is framed as a direct, if misunderstood, result of Operation Minuet's psychological pressures.\r\n- Her complete ignorance of the grander conspiracy provides dramatic irony.\r\n\r\n**Sources:**\r\n\r\n- \"John\" by Cynthia Lennon\r\n- \"The Beatles Anthology\"\r\n- Philip Norman's \"John Lennon: The Life\"\r\n\r\n## Voice and Dialogue Notes\r\n\r\n**Speech Patterns:**\r\n\r\n- Softer, more considered than John's sharp wit.\r\n- Speaks with a refined Lancashire accent.\r\n- Often asks pleading questions (\"John, when will you be home?\", \"Can't we just have one quiet evening?\").\r\n\r\n## Costume and Visual Notes\r\n\r\n**Physical Description:**\r\n\r\n- Blonde, with a stylish 1960s bouffant that becomes more subdued over time.\r\n- Poised and graceful, but with sadness in her eyes.\r\n\r\n**Attire:**\r\n\r\n- Embodies the stylish, \"Swinging London\" wife in the early acts: Mary Quant-style mini-dresses, fashionable coats.\r\n- As she becomes more marginalized, her clothing becomes simpler and less vibrant, reflecting her emotional state.\r\n\r\n## Scene-Specific Notes\r\n\r\n**Kenwood Scenes (Act 1/2):**\r\nThese scenes should highlight her attempts to create a peaceful domestic haven, constantly disrupted by John's moods, his entourage, or a phone call about a new controversy (like the \"Jesus\" story), leaving her confused and alone in a large, empty room.\r\n\r\n**The Discovery (Act 2):**\r\nHer return to Kenwood to find John and Yoko should be played for its quiet, brutal heartbreak. Not a shouting match, but the silent, devastating realization that her life is over.\r\n\r\n**Final Appearance (Act 3):**\r\nA brief, wordless scene of her in her new, more modest home. She picks up a newspaper with John and Yoko on the front, returning his MBE. A single, silent tear would convey her complex mix of sadness, loss, and perhaps a flicker of pride in the man he was, without her ever knowing the full story.","src/content/characters/supporting/cynthia-lennon.md","b5cb751e5d8001c7",{html:7765,metadata:7766},"<h1 id=\"cynthia-lennon\">Cynthia Lennon</h1>\n<h2 id=\"related-research\">Related Research</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/research/lennon-kenwood-era\">Life at Kenwood: The Domestic Beatle</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/research/cynthia-lennon-memoir\">Cynthia’s Perspective on the Breakup</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"motivations\">Motivations</h2>\n<p>Cynthia’s primary motivation is to preserve her family and maintain a semblance of the domestic stability she and John briefly shared before global fame consumed him.

She is already feeling the strain of his fame but believes their love can withstand it. She represents the “normal” life that Philip’s committee sees as a potential weakness to be exploited.</p>\n<p><strong>Act 2 (1966-1968): The Marginalized Wife</strong> - Cynthia becomes increasingly isolated as Operation Minuet’s pressures take their toll on John. She witnesses his paranoia and political obsession grow, all while being pushed further to the sidelines. Her eventual discovery of John and Yoko together at their home is the devastating culmination of this process—the final, brutal severing of her connection to his life.</p>\n<p><strong>Act 3 (1968 onwards): The Survivor</strong> - Now divorced and on the outside, Cynthia watches John’s public transformation from a distance. She sees the headlines, the protests, the MBE return, interpreting it all through the lens of personal betrayal. She is a living ghost from his past, a poignant reminder of the life he discarded on his journey to becoming the icon—and target—he is now.</p>\n<h2 id=\"psychological-profile\">Psychological Profile</h2>\n<p><strong>Core Traits:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Grounded and conventional</li>\n<li>Quietly resilient</li>\n<li>Deeply loyal, almost to a fault</li>\n<li>Possesses a gentle, artistic temperament</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Defense Mechanisms:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Creating Order:</strong> Tries to maintain a perfect, orderly home as a bulwark against the chaos of his life.</li>\n<li><strong>Denial:</strong> Clings to the memory of the “old John,” refusing to accept the new reality until it’s forced upon her.</li>\n<li><strong>Stoicism:</strong> Maintains a public face of quiet dignity even as her private world collapses.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Vulnerabilities:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Her unconditional love for John, which he exploits.</li>\n<li>Her conventional nature makes her unable to comprehend the forces (avant-garde art, radical politics) pulling him away.</li>\n<li>She is completely unaware of the conspiracy, making her powerless against it.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"key-relationships\">Key Relationships</h2>\n<h3 id=\"john-lennon\">John Lennon</h3>\n<p>The love of her life and the source of her deepest pain.

She enters his life when he is under immense strain, trying to hold The Beatles together. She sees his pain and wants to build a sanctuary for him, a life based on genuine love and family, far from the backstabbing politics of the music business.\r\n\r\nHer motivation is not to save The Beatles, but to save Paul *from* The Beatles. She encourages his independence and supports his decision to create a new life and new music, making her a crucial figure in his personal survival, even as the band she is blamed for breaking up implodes.\r\n\r\n## Internal Conflict\r\n\r\nLinda's conflict is between her desire for a private, simple life with Paul and the inescapable reality of his global fame. She is a down-to-earth, independent woman who is thrust into the heart of the world's biggest band and immediately cast as a villain by a public that wants Paul to remain a bachelor Beatle forever.\r\n\r\nShe must navigate being a supportive partner, a new mother, and a stepmother, all while being scrutinized and compared to Yoko Ono, fighting to protect her family's privacy against overwhelming public interest.\r\n\r\n## Character Arc\r\n\r\n**Act 1:** Does not appear.\r\n\r\n**Act 2 (1967-1969): The Grounding Influence** - Linda enters the story as an independent American photographer. She connects with Paul on a human level, seeing the man behind the myth. Their relationship deepens as the band fractures. Her stabilizing presence and their subsequent marriage in March 1969 make Paul seem more settled and conventional, an image that the Committee's conspiracy uses to its advantage to paint him as the \"establishment\" Beatle in contrast to John.\r\n\r\n**Act 3 (1969-1970): The Protector** - As Paul spirals into depression after the band's final collapse, Linda becomes his rock. She coaxes him out of his despair, encourages him to write again, and helps him build a new life and family on their remote Scottish farm. She is the architect of his recovery, completely unaware that the divisions that caused his pain were actively exacerbated by a royal conspiracy. Her victory is purely personal: she saves her husband.\r\n\r\n## Psychological Profile\r\n\r\n**Core Traits:**\r\n\r\n- Fiercely loyal and protective\r\n- Down-to-earth and unpretentious\r\n- Independent and self-assured\r\n- Deeply maternal and family-oriented\r\n\r\n**Defense Mechanisms:**\r\n\r\n- **Creating a Bubble:** Retreating with Paul to their farm in Scotland to create a safe, private world.\r\n- **Photography:** Using her camera as both a tool for expression and a shield, allowing her to be an observer rather than a participant in chaotic scenes.\r\n- **Blunt Honesty:** A straightforward, no-nonsense American attitude that cuts through British class-consciousness and passive-aggression.\r\n\r\n**Vulnerabilities:**\r\n\r\n- As an outsider and an American, she is an easy target for xenophobic criticism.\r\n- Her fierce protection of Paul can be misinterpreted as controlling.\r\n- Her lack of interest in preserving The Beatles' status quo makes her a natural scapegoat.\r\n\r\n## Key Relationships\r\n\r\n### Paul McCartney\r\n\r\nHer soulmate. Linda provides Paul with the unconditional love and family stability he craves. She validates his identity outside of The Beatles, giving him the confidence to start over. Their relationship is the emotional heart of his story arc.\r\n\r\n### John Lennon & Yoko Ono\r\n\r\nTo Linda, they are the primary source of Paul's anguish. She views them less as people and more as a destructive force that has hurt the man she loves. The rivalry is not born of personal dislike but of fierce, protective loyalty to her husband.\r\n\r\n### The Conspiracy (Unknown)\r\n\r\nLinda is completely oblivious to Operation Minuet. However, her positive, stabilizing influence on Paul has an unintended negative consequence within the plot. By helping Paul find happiness and domesticity, she makes him the perfect visual and ideological foil to the chaotic, radical John, thus serving the Committee's goal of fracturing the band along establishment/anti-establishment lines.\r\n\r\n## Historical Timeline Context\r\n\r\n**May 1967:** Meets Paul McCartney at the Bag O'Nails club in London.\r\n\r\n**March 12, 1969:** Marries Paul McCartney in London. This solidifies Paul's image as a settled family man, a key development that MI5 exploits.\r\n\r\n**Late 1969 - Early 1970:** Helps Paul through his depression at their farm in Scotland following the collapse of the *Get Back/Let It Be* sessions and the band's effective end.\r\n\r\n**April 1970:** Stands by Paul as he publicly announces his departure from The Beatles and releases his first solo album, *McCartney*.\r\n\r\n## Historical Accuracy Notes\r\n\r\n**Documented Facts:**\r\n\r\n- Linda was an accomplished photographer before meeting Paul.\r\n- Their meeting, marriage, and retreat to Scotland are all historically accurate.\r\n- She was a crucial figure in helping Paul cope with the Beatles' breakup.\r\n- She was often unfairly blamed or compared to Yoko Ono by the press and public.\r\n\r\n**Creative Liberties:**\r\n\r\n- The central conceit is that her positive, grounding influence on Paul is an *unwitting tool* for the conspiracy. MI5 uses the image of \"Paul and Linda's domestic bliss\" in their narrative to further isolate the \"chaotic\" John and Yoko.\r\n\r\n**Sources:**\r\n\r\n- Barry Miles' \"Paul McCartney: Many Years from Now\"\r\n- \"The Beatles: Get Back\" documentary series\r\n- \"Linda McCartney: The Polaroid Diaries\"\r\n\r\n## Voice and Dialogue Notes\r\n\r\n**Speech Patterns:**\r\n\r\n- Cool, laid-back American accent (New York).\r\n- Straightforward and direct.\r\n- Her dialogue is often focused on Paul's feelings and well-being. \"Are you okay, Macca?\", \"Forget them, let's just go.\"\r\n\r\n## Costume and Visual Notes\r\n\r\n**Physical Description:**\r\n\r\n- Natural blonde hair, often worn loose and un-styled.\r\n- An open, warm smile.\r\n- Often seen with a camera slung around her neck.\r\n\r\n**Attire:**\r\n\r\n- A natural, bohemian style that contrasts with the high fashion of Swinging London. Jeans, shaggy sweaters, vintage t-shirts, and boots. Her look is practical, comfortable, and timeless, symbolizing her authentic, unpretentious nature.\r\n\r\n## Scene-Specific Notes\r\n\r\n**First Meeting (Act 2):**\r\nThe scene should feel like a breath of fresh air. Amidst the psychedelic chaos of a London club, she is a point of calm, grounded reality. The connection with Paul should be instant and based on genuine conversation, not celebrity worship.\r\n\r\n**Scotland Farm (Act 3):**\r\nThese scenes should be rustic and isolated. Linda is in her element, surrounded by nature and family. We see her physically and emotionally pulling Paul back from the brink, her strength and love a stark contrast to the political maneuvering happening in London.\r\n\r\n**Final Scene (Epilogue):**\r\nShe should appear alongside Paul, happy and part of a new, thriving family. Their shared survival and happiness is a victory, achieved in complete ignorance of the plot that tried to use their love as a weapon.","src/content/characters/supporting/linda-mccartney.md","77b25656a14b9fe7",{html:7847,metadata:7848},"<h1 id=\"linda-mccartney-née-eastman\">Linda McCartney (née Eastman)</h1>\n<h2 id=\"related-research\">Related Research</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/research/linda-eastman-photography\">Linda Eastman: Photography Career</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/research/mccartney-scotland-farm\">Paul and Linda: The Scotland Retreat</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"motivations\">Motivations</h2>\n<p>Linda’s motivation is singular and clear: to protect Paul.

Her stabilizing presence and their subsequent marriage in March 1969 make Paul seem more settled and conventional, an image that the Committee’s conspiracy uses to its advantage to paint him as the “establishment” Beatle in contrast to John.</p>\n<p><strong>Act 3 (1969-1970): The Protector</strong> - As Paul spirals into depression after the band’s final collapse, Linda becomes his rock. She coaxes him out of his despair, encourages him to write again, and helps him build a new life and family on their remote Scottish farm. She is the architect of his recovery, completely unaware that the divisions that caused his pain were actively exacerbated by a royal conspiracy. Her victory is purely personal: she saves her husband.</p>\n<h2 id=\"psychological-profile\">Psychological Profile</h2>\n<p><strong>Core Traits:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fiercely loyal and protective</li>\n<li>Down-to-earth and unpretentious</li>\n<li>Independent and self-assured</li>\n<li>Deeply maternal and family-oriented</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Defense Mechanisms:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Creating a Bubble:</strong> Retreating with Paul to their farm in Scotland to create a safe, private world.</li>\n<li><strong>Photography:</strong> Using her camera as both a tool for expression and a shield, allowing her to be an observer rather than a participant in chaotic scenes.</li>\n<li><strong>Blunt Honesty:</strong> A straightforward, no-nonsense American attitude that cuts through British class-consciousness and passive-aggression.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Vulnerabilities:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>As an outsider and an American, she is an easy target for xenophobic criticism.</li>\n<li>Her fierce protection of Paul can be misinterpreted as controlling.</li>\n<li>Her lack of interest in preserving The Beatles’ status quo makes her a natural scapegoat.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"key-relationships\">Key Relationships</h2>\n<h3 id=\"paul-mccartney\">Paul McCartney</h3>\n<p>Her soulmate.

The rivalry is not born of personal dislike but of fierce, protective loyalty to her husband.</p>\n<h3 id=\"the-conspiracy-unknown\">The Conspiracy (Unknown)</h3>\n<p>Linda is completely oblivious to Operation Minuet. However, her positive, stabilizing influence on Paul has an unintended negative consequence within the plot.

The connection with Paul should be instant and based on genuine conversation, not celebrity worship.</p>\n<p><strong>Scotland Farm (Act 3):</strong>\r\nThese scenes should be rustic and isolated. Linda is in her element, surrounded by nature and family. We see her physically and emotionally pulling Paul back from the brink, her strength and love a stark contrast to the political maneuvering happening in London.</p>\n<p><strong>Final Scene (Epilogue):</strong>\r\nShe should appear alongside Paul, happy and part of a new, thriving family.

At 48, he believes in process, paperwork, and keeping a low profile, with no patriotic fire left - only a deep desire for an orderly life and time to tend his prize-winning roses.\r\n\r\nHowever, over five years of psychological warfare against The Beatles, his motivations evolve. What starts as reluctant compliance becomes growing moral discomfort, then active conscience. By 1969, when the mission escalates to assassination, Nigel's motivation transforms completely - from protecting his pension to protecting innocent people from his own government's folly.\r\n\r\nHis final motivation becomes philosophical vindication: proving that choosing conscience over career, even at personal cost, represents the only dignified response to institutional madness.\r\n\r\n## Internal Conflict\r\n\r\nNigel is trapped between his professional obligation to follow orders and his profound, bone-deep certainty that the entire operation is idiotic, dangerous, and doomed to fail. He is a man of logic forced to execute a plan based on aristocratic pique. This conflict intensifies when the mission shifts from mere disruption to something much darker, forcing him to choose between his pension and his conscience.\r\n\r\n## Character Arc\r\n\r\n**Act 1 (1965): The Dutiful Professional** - At 48, Nigel receives the Operation Minuet assignment with weary resignation. He recognizes the absurdity but follows orders, hoping to complete this \"cultural threat assessment\" quietly and return to normal intelligence work.\r\n\r\n**Act 2 (1966-1968): The Growing Conscience** - Over three years of psychological warfare against The Beatles, Nigel's moral discomfort grows. As Clive's enthusiasm becomes unhinged and the targets prove to be ordinary people rather than threats, Nigel begins subtle sabotage. His \"guidance\" to George Harrison fulfills mission briefs while being fundamentally harmless.\r\n\r\n**Act 3 (1969-1970): The Moral Saboteur** - John's MBE return triggers Philip's escalation to assassination, crossing Nigel's final moral line. His deliberate bungling of the charity concert plot represents complete transformation from dutiful agent to active underminer. His exile to the Falklands becomes philosophical vindication - he chose conscience over career.\r\n\r\n## Psychological Profile\r\n\r\n**Core Traits:**\r\n\r\n- Methodical and detail-oriented\r\n- Deeply cynical but hides it under a veneer of professionalism\r\n- Melancholic and prone to philosophical sighs\r\n- Possesses a dry, understated wit that no one else appreciates\r\n\r\n**Vulnerabilities:**\r\n\r\n- His desire for a quiet life makes him conflict-averse.\r\n- His partner's incompetence is a constant, unmanageable liability.\r\n- He has a flicker of a moral compass that he can't quite extinguish.\r\n\r\n## Key Relationships\r\n\r\n### Clive Barrow (The Unprofessional Partner)\r\n\r\nNigel views Clive as a walking disaster, an enthusiast in a field that demands quiet competence. He is Clive's handler, babysitter, and reluctant straight man. Every \"creative\" idea Clive has gives Nigel a migraine.\r\n\r\n### Prince Philip (The Unreasonable Client)\r\n\r\nHe sees Philip as the ultimate entitled management figure, a man so insulated from reality that he can't see the folly of his own commands. Nigel's interactions with him are models of strained deference.\r\n\r\n### John Lennon (The Catalyst)\r\n\r\nNigel's relationship with John evolves dramatically over five years. Initially in 1965, John is just a name on a file - another assignment to complete. Through 1966-1968 surveillance and psychological warfare, Nigel begins to see John as a real person: talented, flawed, but fundamentally human.\r\n\r\nBy 1969, when John returns his MBE and Philip demands assassination, Nigel's empathy crystallizes into active protection. He recognizes John as a fellow man trapped by circumstances beyond his control - a target of institutional fury rather than a genuine threat. This empathy becomes the catalyst for Nigel's complete moral transformation and deliberate sabotage of the assassination plot.\r\n\r\n## Historical Timeline Context\r\n\r\n**1965:** At 48, Nigel receives Operation Minuet with weary resignation, viewing it as another bureaucratic assignment to endure until retirement. His initial approach is purely professional - complete the mission efficiently and avoid complications.\r\n\r\n**1966-1968:** Three years of psychological warfare gradually erode Nigel's professional detachment. Observing The Beatles as real people rather than targets, combined with Clive's increasing delusion, awakens his dormant conscience. His \"guidance\" to George Harrison represents early moral compromise - fulfilling orders while minimizing harm.\r\n\r\n**1969:** John's MBE return and Philip's assassination demand cross Nigel's final moral line. His transformation from dutiful agent to active saboteur represents complete philosophical evolution - from institutional loyalty to human decency.\r\n\r\n**1970-Exile:** The charity concert plot's deliberate failure and subsequent Falklands exile become Nigel's vindication. He chose conscience over career, proving that individual moral courage can resist institutional madness, even at personal cost.\r\n\r\n## Voice and Speech Patterns\r\n\r\n**Core Vocal Characteristics:**\r\n\r\n- Speaks in measured, bureaucratic tones with occasional flashes of dry wit\r\n- Uses precise, formal language even in casual conversation\r\n- Has a habit of clearing his throat before delivering bad news\r\n- Voice carries the weight of accumulated disappointment and resignation\r\n- Rarely raises his voice, preferring pointed silences to express displeasure\r\n\r\n**Signature Speech Patterns:**\r\n\r\n- **Bureaucratic Precision:** Uses exact terminology and proper procedures even for absurd situations\r\n- **Understated Sarcasm:** Delivers cutting observations in a deadpan manner that often goes unnoticed\r\n- **Professional Euphemisms:** Masters the art of saying nothing while appearing to be helpful\r\n- **Philosophical Asides:** Occasionally mutters existential observations under his breath\r\n\r\n**Emotional Vocal States:**\r\n\r\n- **Professional Mode:** Crisp, efficient delivery with no wasted words\r\n- **Exasperated:** Longer pauses between words, slight edge creeping into his tone\r\n- **Contemplative:** Softer, more reflective, often accompanied by sighs\r\n- **Subtly Subversive:** Maintains professional tone while delivering deliberately unhelpful advice\r\n\r\n**Sample Dialogue Patterns:**\r\n\r\n- \"Yes, sir. That is... certainly one approach to the situation.\"\r\n- \"I've reviewed the files extensively. The subject appears to be... *pause* ...a musician.\"\r\n- \"Clive's methodology is quite... unique.

with prize-winning roses\r\n- Writes poetry that he never shows anyone\r\n\r\n## Scene-Specific Performance Notes\r\n\r\n**MI5 Briefing Scenes:**\r\n\r\n- Sits with perfect posture, taking minimal but

He is a technician, not an ideologue. He likely has no opinion on John Lennon, pop music, or the Crown's dignity. His goal is to execute a clean, successful operation as per his training. This professional pride is his sole motivation, and it is relentlessly frustrated by the chaotic incompetence of Operation Elegy.\r\n\r\n## Internal Conflict\r\n\r\nArthur's conflict is between his years of professional training and the amateurish absurdity of the mission he's been assigned. He knows the equipment is substandard, the plan is theatrical nonsense, and his handler (Clive) is a dangerous fool. His struggle is to maintain his professional calm and execute his orders despite every one of his instincts telling him this is a doomed, mismanaged farce. He is a man of action forced to serve a man of bad ideas.\r\n\r\n## Character Arc\r\n\r\nArthur has a brief, tragic, and darkly comic arc contained entirely within the climax. He appears as **The Professional**, a man who knows his job. He quickly becomes **The Confused Instrument**, bewildered by his handler's bizarre commands and the faulty equipment. He ends as **The Failure**, a skilled operative defeated not by the enemy, but by his own side's institutional folly. He is a pawn who is sacrificed for nothing.\r\n\r\n## Psychological Profile\r\n\r\n**Core Traits:**\r\n\r\n- Methodical and calm under pressure\r\n- Deeply practical and results-oriented\r\n- Economical with words and movement\r\n- Possesses a quiet, professional pride in his skills\r\n- Deeply cynical about management\r\n\r\n**Vulnerabilities:**\r\n\r\n- His professionalism makes him unable to refuse a direct, albeit stupid, order.\r\n- He is completely out of his element when dealing with artistic or theatrical concepts.\r\n- His skills are entirely dependent on the quality of his tools and his handler, both of which are terrible.\r\n\r\n## Key Relationships\r\n\r\n### Clive Barrow\r\n\r\nHis handler and the source of all his professional misery. Arthur views Clive with the quiet contempt of a master craftsman forced to take instructions from a delusional amateur. He follows Clive's orders but his every action and line of dialogue should convey his deep skepticism of Clive's \"artistic\" methodology.\r\n\r\n### Nigel Finch\r\n\r\nArthur likely never interacts with Nigel, but Nigel represents the kind of competent, weary professional Arthur would understand and respect. They are two sides of the same coin: career civil servants trapped in an absurd situation, though Arthur's role is far more perilous.\r\n\r\n## Voice and Dialogue Notes\r\n\r\n**Speech Patterns:**\r\n\r\n- Clipped, concise, and technical. Uses military or professional jargon.\r\n- He reports problems; he does not express feelings.\r\n- His dialogue is sparse. He is a man of action, not words.\r\n\r\n**Sample Dialogue:**\r\n\r\n- \"The bracket's not flush. It's wobbling.\"\r\n- \"Negative visibility on the mark.\"\r\n- \"I don't have a clean shot.\"\r\n\r\n## Visual Appearance and Costume Notes\r\n\r\n**Physical Description:**\r\n\r\n- 50s, physically fit but with the weary face of a man who has seen too much.\r\n- Steady hands are his most defining feature.\r\n- Carries himself with an understated confidence that dissolves into quiet frustration.\r\n\r\n**Attire:**\r\n\r\n- Dressed as an anonymous technician or roadie. Dark, practical work clothes. A boilersuit or canvas jacket.\r\n- He is dressed to be invisible, which contrasts sharply with Clive's desire to be the center of his own drama.\r\n\r\n## Scene-Specific Notes\r\n\r\n**The Rafters (Scene 29):**\r\nArthur's performance should be a masterclass in controlled frustration. He should handle the antique rifle with professional care, but his expression should betray his deep misgivings. Every line he speaks should be a simple, factual report of a problem (\"It's wobbling,\" \"I can't see\"), which serves to highlight the absurdity of Clive's grand vision.

He is the \"Q\" of this world, but instead of laser watches, he offers faulty listening devices from the Cold War and cameras that weigh ten pounds. His primary conflict is not with enemy agents, but with his colleagues' sloppy paperwork. He begrudgingly gives Nigel and Clive their gear, warning them at length about the replacement cost of a single transmitter screw and demanding they return everything in the original packaging.\r\n\r\n## Voice and Speech Patterns\r\n\r\n**Core Vocal Characteristics:**\r\n\r\n- Speaks in clipped, irritated tones as if everyone is wasting his precious time\r\n- Has a nasal quality that makes everything sound like a complaint\r\n- Uses technical jargon mixed with bureaucratic terminology\r\n- Voice becomes increasingly shrill when discussing damaged equipment\r\n- Frequently interrupts himself to add additional warnings and caveats\r\n\r\n**Signature Speech Patterns:**\r\n\r\n- **Inventory Obsession:** Refers to equipment by catalog numbers rather than common names\r\n- **Damage Paranoia:** Every sentence includes warnings about proper handling and return policies\r\n- **Bureaucratic Precision:** Insists on exact procedures for the most mundane requests\r\n- **Historical Grievances:** References past incidents of equipment misuse with bitter detail\r\n\r\n**Emotional Vocal States:**\r\n\r\n- **Routine Irritation:** Default state of barely contained annoyance\r\n- **Equipment Panic:** Voice rises to near-hysteria when discussing potential damage\r\n- **Bureaucratic Satisfaction:** Briefly pleased when forms are filled out correctly\r\n- **Nostalgic Melancholy:** Wistful when discussing obsolete but well-maintained equipment\r\n\r\n**Sample Dialogue Patterns:**\r\n\r\n- \"Item 47-B requires Form 12-C in triplicate, and I'll need your supervisor's signature on the liability waiver.\"\r\n- \"This listening device cost the taxpayers forty-seven pounds in 1963. That's... *calculating* ...roughly three hundred pounds in today's money.\"\r\n- \"The last agent who borrowed a camera like this returned it with a cracked lens. Do you know what a replacement lens costs?\"\r\n\r\n## Visual Appearance and Costume Design\r\n\r\n**Physical Description:**\r\n\r\n- 5'6\", thin and wiry with the posture of someone perpetually hunched over paperwork\r\n- Balding with carefully combed-over gray hair\r\n- Wears thick glasses that magnify his disapproving expressions\r\n- Has ink stains on his fingers from constantly filling out forms\r\n- Moves with the precise, economical motions of someone who has organized the same space for decades\r\n\r\n**Costume Consistency (All Acts):**\r\n\r\n- Wears the same style of brown

shoes suitable for standing on concrete floors\r\n- Always wears a pocket protector filled with various pens and small tools\r\n\r\n**Symbolic Visual Elements:**\r\n\r\n- **Clipboard:** Never seen

every storage cabinet and drawer\r\n- **Rubber Stamps:** Multiple stamps for different approval levels and warnings\r\n\r\n**Distinctive Physical Mannerisms:**\r\n\r\n- Adjusts glasses before examining any piece of equipment\r\n- Taps pen impatiently while waiting for forms to be completed\r\n- Physically handles equipment with exaggerated care to demonstrate proper technique\r\n- Counts items obsessively, often re-counting to be sure\r\n\r\n## Psychological Quirks and Behavioral Notes\r\n\r\n**Obsessive Behaviors:**\r\n\r\n- Maintains detailed logs of every piece of equipment, including minor repairs and cleaning schedules\r\n- Reorganizes storage areas according to increasingly complex classification systems\r\n- Keeps backup forms for backup forms in case of paperwork emergencies\r\n- Memorizes serial numbers and can recite the history of any piece of equipment\r\n\r\n**Professional Philosophy:**\r\n\r\n- Believes that proper equipment maintenance is the foundation of national security\r\n- Views field agents as careless children who cannot be trusted with valuable resources\r\n- Takes personal pride in keeping obsolete equipment in perfect working condition\r\n- Considers himself the unsung hero of intelligence operations\r\n\r\n**Social Interactions:**\r\n\r\n- Treats every equipment request as a personal favor that will likely be abused\r\n-

investigator\r\n- Uses magnifying glass to identify microscopic scratches or wear\r\n- Maintains detailed notes about the condition of returned items\r\n- Expresses either satisfaction or outrage based on equipment condition\r\n\r\n**Administrative Interactions:**\r\n\r\n- Sits at a desk covered with perfectly organized forms and catalogs\r\n- Refers to multiple manuals and regulations before answering simple questions\r\n- Takes visible pleasure in finding the correct form for any situation\r\n- Becomes animated when discussing proper bureaucratic procedures\r\n\r\n## Satirical Comedy Elements\r\n\r\n**Steven Conrad-Style Bureaucratic Absurdism:**\r\n\r\n- Treats spy equipment like library books, complete with due dates and late fees\r\n- Applies retail customer service logic to

His goals are twofold: to preserve the purity and discipline of Indian classical music, and to act as a responsible bridge between the East and the West. He is not motivated by fame, pop charts, or the counter-culture movement that latches onto him. He sees the explosion of Western interest in Indian culture as both an opportunity and a grave danger, and his primary motivation is to ensure the tradition is respected, not simply consumed as a fleeting trend.\r\n\r\n## Internal Conflict\r\n\r\nHis core conflict is the \"Guru's Dilemma\": How to share a deep, sacred tradition with a superficial world without it being diluted, commercialized, and ultimately destroyed? He is pleased by the earnest interest of students like George Harrison, but deeply troubled by the \"hippie\" movement that co-opts the sitar and other Indian cultural symbols for drug-fueled, undisciplined ends. He constantly weighs his desire to teach against his responsibility to protect his culture from caricature.\r\n\r\n## Character Arc\r\n\r\nRavi Shankar's arc is that of the steadfast teacher whose influence is misinterpreted and ultimately vindicated.\r\n\r\n**Act 1 (1965-1966): The Catalyst from Afar** - Ravi Shankar exists as a world-renowned but niche artist. His music, discovered by George Harrison, becomes the catalyst for a new sound in Western pop (*Norwegian Wood*, *Love You To*). The Committee takes note of this \"foreign influence,\" flagging it as a potential vector for subversion long before George even meets him.\r\n\r\n**Act 2 (1967-1969): The Misunderstood Mentor** - After meeting George, Ravi becomes his formal teacher. Their relationship is one of strict discipline and deep spiritual learning. However, from the outside, Operation Minuet sees this differently. To them, George's trip to India and his devotion to Shankar is evidence of indoctrination. They view Ravi as a potential foreign agent or, at best, an unwitting tool corrupting a national treasure. Their surveillance of him and George provides \"evidence\" that fuels their paranoia.\r\n\r\n**Act 3 (1970-1971): The Transcendent Purpose** - With The Beatles dissolved, Ravi's influence on George comes to its purest fruition. He approaches George not for pop music, but for a humanitarian crisis, leading to the Concert for Bangladesh. This act of selfless musical activism is so far beyond the Committee's cynical understanding that it effectively proves their theories wrong. He has guided George not to subversion, but to a higher purpose, completely escaping the petty confines of their conspiracy.\r\n\r\n## Psychological Profile\r\n\r\n**Core Traits:**\r\n\r\n- Dignified and patient\r\n- Deeply disciplined and principled\r\n- Possesses a quiet but immense authority\r\n- A natural teacher, but a demanding one\r\n\r\n**Vulnerabilities:**\r\n\r\n- His greatest frustration and vulnerability is seeing his life's work and culture being disrespected or trivialized. The sound of a badly played sitar is a source of genuine pain for him.\r\n\r\n## Key Relationships\r\n\r\n### George Harrison (The Earnest Student)\r\n\r\nRavi sees in George a rare and genuine soul from the pop world. He feels a paternal responsibility to guide him correctly, not just in music but in life. Their relationship is the emotional and spiritual core of George's story arc, a sanctuary from the madness of The Beatles and the Committee's machinations.\r\n\r\n### The Committee / Clive Barrow (The Suspicious Establishment)\r\n\r\nThe Committee views Ravi Shankar through a Cold War lens. They cannot comprehend a relationship based on art and spirituality. In their files (codenamed \"Operation Mantra\"), he is profiled as a potential \"handler\" or \"guru\" exerting undue influence. They misinterpret his teachings on discipline and detachment as anti-Western brainwashing designed to pull a Beatle out of the sphere of British cultural influence.\r\n\r\n### The Western Counter-Culture (The Unwanted Flock)\r\n\r\nHe has a fraught relationship with the \"hippie\" movement. While he may appreciate their anti-war sentiment, he is dismayed by their lack of discipline and their superficial adoption of Indian spirituality. He sees them as misguided children playing with sacred things.\r\n\r\n## Historical Timeline Context\r\n\r\n**1965:** George Harrison first plays a sitar on *Norwegian Wood*, sparking Western interest. The Committee likely opens a preliminary file on \"Eastern musical influence.\"\r\n\r\n**June 1966:** George meets Ravi Shankar in London. This is a key event, marking the beginning of the formal student-teacher relationship.\r\n\r\n**1967:** Ravi performs at the Monterey Pop Festival, an event he later expressed ambivalence about due to the drug-fueled atmosphere. For the Committee, this places him at the heart of the counter-culture they fear.\r\n\r\n**1967-1968:** George and the other Beatles travel to India to study Transcendental Meditation with the Maharishi, but George's specific musical tutelage under Shankar is a separate, more profound thread that the Committee conflates with the general \"India craze.\"\r\n\r\n**1971:** Ravi approaches George about the humanitarian crisis in Bangladesh, leading to the Concert for Bangladesh. This is the culmination of their relationship, using music for a cause far beyond the scope of the conspiracy.\r\n\r\n## Historical Accuracy Notes\r\n\r\n**Documented Facts:**\r\n\r\n- Ravi Shankar was a world-renowned sitar virtuoso long before meeting The Beatles.\r\n- He was George Harrison's sitar teacher and a profound spiritual influence.\r\n- He expressed deep reservations about the hippie movement's co-opting of Indian music and culture.\r\n- He famously disliked his performance at Monterey Pop.\r\n- He was the direct impetus for the Concert for Bangladesh.\r\n\r\n**Creative Liberties:**\r\n\r\n- Any suggestion of surveillance by MI5 or a royal committee (\"Operation Mantra\") is entirely fictional.\r\n- His portrayal as a \"person of interest\" in a government conspiracy is imagined for the story.\r\n- The idea that his teachings were interpreted as a form of \"radicalization\" by the British establishment is a narrative invention.\r\n\r\n**Sources:**\r\n\r\n- \"Raga Mala: The Autobiography of Ravi Shankar\"\r\n- \"The Beatles Anthology\"\r\n- \"George Harrison: Living in the Material World\" (documentary by Martin Scorsese)\r\n- Biographies of George Harrison, such as \"Here Comes the Sun\" by Joshua M. Greene.\r\n\r\n## Voice and Dialogue Notes\r\n\r\n**Speech Patterns:**\r\n\r\n- Speaks with precision and thoughtfulness.\r\n- Calm, measured, and dignified tone.\r\n- Often uses musical or spiritual metaphors (e.g., \"You cannot find the note if your mind is full of noise.\")\r\n- English is fluent and articulate, with the distinct cadence of an Indian academic.\r\n\r\n**Emotional States:**\r\n\r\n- **Patient:** When teaching a willing student like George.\r\n- **Frustrated:** When discussing the trivialization of his culture by the West.\r\n- **Serene:** When playing or discussing the deep theory of his music.\r\n- **Urgent:** The one time his calm breaks is when he speaks of the suffering in Bangladesh.\r\n\r\n**Key Phrases/Concepts:**\r\n\r\n- Emphasis on \"discipline,\" \"practice,\" \"tradition.\"\r\n- References to \"rasa\" (the emotional essence of a piece of music).\r\n- Distinguishing between true \"sadhana\" (spiritual practice) and fleeting trends.\r\n\r\n## Costume and Visual Notes\r\n\r\n**Physical Description:**\r\n\r\n- Slender build, warm eyes, and a gentle but commanding expression.\r\n- Impeccable posture.\r\n\r\n**Attire:**\r\n\r\n- Almost always seen in traditional Indian clothing: a simple, elegant kurta and pajamas.\r\n- In formal Western concert settings, he might wear a more ornate sherwani.\r\n- His clothing reflects his rejection of Western pop fashion and his rootedness in his own culture.\r\n\r\n**Symbolic Elements:**\r\n\r\n- The Sitar: It is an extension of his body. He holds it and cares for it with reverence.\r\n- Incense/Candles: The atmosphere around him is one of calm, focused ritual.\r\n\r\n## Scene-Specific Notes\r\n\r\n**First Meeting (1966):**\r\nRavi should be initially skeptical of the famous pop star, testing George's sincerity before agreeing to teach him. He is unimpressed by his fame, only by his humility and willingness to learn.\r\n\r\n**Lessons in India (1967):**\r\nScenes should emphasize the rigor and discipline of his teaching. This is not a casual jam session. It's focused, difficult work, showing George's dedication and contrasting starkly with a montage of the chaotic, drug-fueled \"Summer of Love\" happening back in the West.\r\n\r\n**Concert for Bangladesh (1971):**\r\nOnstage, he is the picture of dignity. His opening address to the audience (\"If you appreciate the tuning so much, I hope you will enjoy the playing more\") should land perfectly, showcasing his gentle wit and authority. He is the event's spiritual anchor.\r\n\r\n**Surveillance Montage:**\r\nA scene could show the Committee's perspective: grainy, black-and-white photos of Ravi and George sitting calmly with a sitar, while a voiceover from Clive interprets it with paranoid suspicion: \"He isolates the target, removes him from familiar surroundings, and begins the indoctrination process...\"\r\n\r\nThis character profile establishes Ravi Shankar as a figure of immense integrity whose genuine purpose is completely misinterpreted by the story's conspirators.","src/content/characters/supporting/ravi-shankar.md","b449aebc50d621a9",{html:8137,metadata:8138},"<h1 id=\"ravi-shankar\">Ravi Shankar</h1>\n<h2 id=\"motivations\">Motivations</h2>\n<p>Ravi Shankar is motivated by a profound duty to his art and his culture.

Can simulate genuine worry when politically necessary\r\n\r\n**Sample Dialogue Patterns:**\r\n\r\n- \"I'm confident that your considerable expertise will guide you toward the most... appropriate resolution.\"\r\n- \"The parameters of this undertaking are necessarily flexible, allowing for your professional discretion in implementation.\"\r\n- \"I have every faith that you'll navigate these
