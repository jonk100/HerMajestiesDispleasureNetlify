episode_question: "Is the band already dead—or can something unexpected bring it back to life?"
episode_button: "They don’t fix the past. They change the ending."
notes: "This episode pivots the series from slow collapse to fragile resurgence. Twickenham represents institutional death; Apple represents intimacy and choice. Billy Preston functions as an external conscience, and the rooftop idea restores forward momentum without resolving deeper wounds."
