closing_image: "Nigel Finch alone in a cold MI5 safe house, realizing the joke is over and he is now complicit in something unforgivable."

episode_question: "What does power do when its authority is rejected instead of obeyed?"
episode_button: "They broke the band. He broke the rules."
notes: "This episode completes the long psychological campaign while exposing its fatal flaw: Lennon’s refusal to play the role assigned to him. Paul’s paranoia delivers the final fracture the state wanted, but John’s return of the MBE transforms him from cultural irritant into political dissident. Philip’s wounded pride converts a cynical operation into a personal crusade, crossing the series’ moral event horizon and setting Act III on a collision course with irreversible consequences."
