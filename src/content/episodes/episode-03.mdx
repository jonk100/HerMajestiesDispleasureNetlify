episode_question: "What happens when the center disappears?"
episode_button: "They didn’t remove Brian Epstein. They simply benefited when he was gone."
notes: "This episode marks the irreversible shift of the series. The conspiracy becomes almost irrelevant as real-world forces—death, love, ambition, belief—outpace it. George escapes inward. John finds a new axis of meaning. Paul is steered toward establishment approval. Ringo proves immune. Brian Epstein’s death is the true plot turn: the removal of the load-bearing beam. From this point forward, the Beatles do not need to be manipulated—they will collapse under their own redistributed weight."
