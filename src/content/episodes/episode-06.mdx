notes: "Episode 6 resolves the conspiracy not through exposure or triumph, but through collapse. The attempted assassination fails not because of heroism, but because art, incompetence, and conscience collide. The Crown protects itself through administrative burial, not justice. The operatives are erased. Philip is diminished. Lennon survives—until history intervenes without symbolism or meaning. The final epilogue reframes the entire series as a tragedy of scale: the state’s obsession mattered far less than it believed, and its victory is simply that it endured long enough to deny it ever cared."
