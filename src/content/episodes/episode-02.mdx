opening_image: "Prince Philip standing alone in a perfectly ordered room, cutting off a Beatles song mid-phrase."
closing_image: "A stack of stamped letters sliding into an outgoing post tray, trivial actions poised to ignite international chaos."

episode_question: "Is this music merely strange—or is it genuinely dangerous to power?"
episode_button: "They don’t silence the band. They change how the band hears itself."
notes: "This episode establishes the central irony of the series: institutional incompetence paired with disturbingly accurate psychological instincts. While the state misunderstands the art, it correctly identifies the fault lines—Paul’s fear of losing love, George’s spiritual hunger, John’s attraction to destruction. The Beatles are never attacked directly; they are encouraged to pull apart themselves."
