# Myth vs. Reality

## Core Concept

This theme examines the gap between public mythology and private dysfunction. Both The Beatles and the Royal Family are institutions that project unity and purpose to the world, while internally struggling with the same human conflicts, resentments, and inadequacies that affect any family or organization.

## Dual Mythologies

### The Beatles Myth
- **Public Image**: Unified, harmonious, "Fab Four" who changed music together
- **Reality**: Four individuals growing apart, fighting over business, struggling with identity
- **Myth Function**: Cultural symbol of 1960s optimism and creative unity

### Royal Family Myth
- **Public Image**: Dignified, purposeful, symbol of national stability
- **Reality**: Petty squabbles, inherited insecurity, institutional inertia
- **Myth Function**: Symbol of tradition and continuity in changing times

## Character Contrasts

### John Lennon: Public Rebel/Private Confusion
- **Public**: Political radical, artistic revolutionary, confident leader
- **Private**: Insecure about solo career, uncertain about future, missing band structure
- **The Gap**: His public confidence masks private vulnerability

### Paul McCartney: Public Peacemaker/Private Businessman
- **Public**: Diplomatic band member, mediator, team player
- **Private**: Tough negotiator, frustrated with artistic chaos, focused on practicalities
- **The Gap**: His public harmony masks private frustration

### Prince Philip: Public Duty/Private Resentment
- **Public**: Dignified royal, serving Crown, above petty concerns
- **Private**: Insecure about role, petty about perceived slights, obsessed with control
- **The Gap**: His public dignity masks private insecurity

### Queen Elizabeth: Public Stability/Private Detachment
- **Public**: Wise, steady, embodiment of institutional continuity
- **Private**: Emotionally distant, focused on process over people, institutional thinker
- **The Gap**: Her public stability masks private detachment

## Symbolic Elements

### Public Spaces vs. Private Spaces
- **Concert Halls**: Public performance, collective myth-making
- **Dressing Rooms**: Private reality, individual struggles
- **Palace Rooms**: Public ceremony vs. private family dynamics

### Media as Myth-Maker
- **Television Cameras**: Create public narrative, freeze moments into mythology
- **Newspapers**: Reinforce public images, ignore private realities
- **Microphones**: Public voice amplification, private thoughts filtered

### Doors and Walls
- **Palace Gates**: Public barriers, controlled access to royal reality
- **Studio Doors**: Creative sanctuary, private space for myth-making
- **Closed Meeting Rooms**: Private decisions that create public consequences

## Scene Progression

### Act 1: Myth Creation
- **MBE Ceremony**: Public ritual that creates competing narratives
- Both institutions attempt to absorb each other's power

### Act 2: Myth Strain
- **Band Conflicts**: Private tensions breaking through public unity
- **Lunch Conversations**: Private moments that contradict public images

### Act 3: Myth Collapse
- **Crown Endures**: Royal private reality exposed as petty and limited
- **Imagine Montage**: Beatles private realities settling into new forms

## Thematic Irony

### Institutional Parallels
- Both "families" use **public relations** to hide private dysfunction
- Both struggle with **leadership succession** and changing times
- Both believe their **public mission** justifies private compromises

### The Performance of Unity
- Beatles must **perform unity** while falling apart
- Royals must **perform dignity** while squabbling
- Public success requires **private sacrifice**

### Media Complicity
- Press needs **simple narratives** about complex realities
- Myth-making serves **both institutions** by simplifying their stories
- Public prefers **comforting myths** to uncomfortable truths

## Questions Explored

- Can **public mythology** survive private reality indefinitely?
- Do **institutions** need private dysfunction to maintain public unity?
- Is **authenticity** possible in the age of image management?
- Which is more powerful: **mythic unity** or **honest division**?

## Visual Language

### Public Scenes
- **Formal Composition**: Symmetrical, composed, mythic framing
- **Bright Lighting**: Public visibility, clarity of image
- **Wide Shots**: Institutions as unified entities

### Private Scenes
- **Handheld Cameras**: Intimate, revealing, uncomposed reality
- **Low Lighting**: Private vulnerability, hidden truths
- **Close-ups**: Individual emotions within institutional roles

This theme suggests that all institutions—whether rock bands or monarchies—survive through the careful maintenance of public myths that mask private human realities. The tragedy is not that the myths are false, but that the private realities are so universally, disappointingly human.
