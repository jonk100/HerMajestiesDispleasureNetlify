# Scene Outline: Get Back Sessions (Replacing S19)

Based on the research, proposing **5-7 scenes** that capture the authentic drama of the Get Back sessions, showing both the downfall AND the moments of hope. This gives a more accurate and dramatically rich portrayal than a single scene of dissolution.

- **Paul's vulnerable confession:** "I'm scared of me being the boss. And I have been for a couple of years. I always feel as though I'm trying to put you down and stop you playing. But I'm not. I'm trying to stop us all playing, until we know what we're playing"
- **Paul continues:** "I never get any support, or anything. So I just think, 'Oh, well. Fuck it'. And I know it's right, and you know it's right"

- **Paul:** "The thing is, that's what I was trying to say to George, you know. Whereas previously I would have said, 'Take it there with diddle-der-diddle-der'. But I was trying last week to say, 'Now take it there. Anything you like. Put whatever you...'"
- **John:** "You see, the point is now, we both do that to George this time, and because of the build-up to it"

### Key Beats
- Control room - listening to playbacks
- **Paul frustrated:** "I just have a feeling that we... It's all right, you know? It's nothing to complain about, but... But it's just funny to sort of realize that after this is all over, you'll be off in a black bag somewhere on the Albert Hall, you know?"
- **Michael Lindsay-Hogg:** "What you're moaning about is there's no payoff"
- **Paul:** "I'd like to sort of do a... for the finish. And we just get out in the open, change of scene, and go and do it somewhere else, do it on a live show, do it on a stage. You know, I'd like to light a rocket and really sort of take off for the end of it"
- Someone suggests checking out the roof
- They go up - Paul, Ringo, Glyn Johns, Michael Lindsay-Hogg
- Looking out over London
- **The realization:** We could do it right here
- **Glyn Johns:** "If they wanted to play to a large crowd, why not play on the roof to the whole of the West End"

- Back downstairs
- **Agreement:** Let's do it. Rooftop. Wednesday or Thursday.
- For the first time in weeks, they're excited about something together

---

## **Overall Arc Across These Scenes**

1. **Dissolution** (19A-19D): Shows Operation Minuet's success - natural tensions amplified to breaking point
2. **Breaking Point** (19C): George quits - the consequence
3. **Self-Awareness** (19D): They understand what's happening but struggle to fix it
4. **Revival** (19E-19F): Billy Preston and Apple Studios give them hope
5. **Solution** (19G): The rooftop concert as their way forward

## **Why This Works Better Than Single Scene**

- **More dramatically accurate**: The Get Back sessions weren't just grim - they had real highs
- **Uses actual quotes**: Grounds the screenplay in reality
- **Shows complexity**: The Beatles weren't just dissolving - they were fighting to stay together
- **Serves multiple arcs**: Paul's control issues, George's frustration, John's detachment, Billy as savior
- **Supports premise**: Operation Minuet amplified existing problems, but didn't completely destroy them
- **Better movie experience**: Varied emotional beats, humor, tension, hope, despair, and ultimately redemption attempt

## **Total Page Count Estimate**
**19-24 pages total** (compared to 2 pages currently) - but these are multiple scenes showing a critical month in Beatles history, so the expanded coverage is justified for the dramatic richness it provides.
