- **Economical with Words:** Especially in his younger years, he was often concise and to the point. He didn't waste words on pleasantries if he had a point to make.
- **The "Grumble":** He was famous for his weary dissatisfaction with the state of the world or the music business. It was a philosophical grumble, not just complaining.
