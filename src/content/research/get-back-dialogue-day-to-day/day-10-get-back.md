### Overview

January 22nd, 1969 (Apple Studios, London): After John tells Yoko, Paul, and George about having received a letter from Millie Sutcliffe requesting his financial support, George reads aloud from the letter while John expresses his derision for Mrs. Sutcliffe's justification of responsibility – his old friendship with Stuart – and points out that Stuart didn't even have much regard for her.

### Dialogue

GEORGE: Well, what's Mrs. Sutcliffe want?

JOHN: Well, what they all want – money.

GEORGE: [reading] "This is the last cry for help. My bank is now to the wall—" [laughs] My "back".

JOHN: "Back", "bank". [George laughs] I thought it was "bank" too.

GEORGE: "—as it's been many times before, but this is the last time. Since [Stuart's father] Charlie's sudden death in March '66, o my consequent o' long—" What?

YOKO: [reading] "Illness".

GEORGE: "—illness, I have managed to exist—"

JOHN: [withering] "Illness"? She's an alcoholic.

GEORGE: "—but now it is the end of the road."

JOHN: She's an alcoholic, you know.

GEORGE: "I beg of you, please come if only for the sake of the boy you once knew." Fucking hell…

JOHN: You know, what's it got to do with me?

GEORGE: What's it got to do with Stu?

JOHN: Yeah.

GEORGE: I mean, she didn't know him.

JOHN: No, he hated her anyway. [laughter] I remember at college he used to tell me so. Except for she gave him twenty ciggies a day and five bob. [pause] So I mean, it's registered [inaudible], I've just got to write her and say, "What?" Or something. I ought to… Should we carry on here, in the rock'n'roll show?

GEORGE: [laughs] Yeah.

### Notes

A revealing moment showing John's cynicism and emotional distance regarding requests for financial help, even from people connected to his past. Stuart Sutcliffe was the original Beatles bassist and John's close friend who died in 1962. The exchange with George shows their shared dark humor.
