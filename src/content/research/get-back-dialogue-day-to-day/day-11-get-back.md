# 23 January 1969

## 1

### Overview

January 23rd, 1969 (Apple Studios, London): While waiting for Paul and George to arrive in the studio, Michael Lindsay-Hogg asks a piano-toying Ringo if he will have his own song for the upcoming Beatles album. (Note: The song Ringo will work on over the next few days is, of course, 'Octopus's Garden'.)

### Dialogue

MICHAEL: Are you going to sing [your own song on this record]?

RINGO: Um, more than likely I'll get one later on.

MICHAEL: Good.

JOHN: Didn't George write you one too?

RINGO: George has written one for both of us.

JOHN: You're both in it?

RINGO: Yeah. [John and Yoko laugh] Hey hey Georgie— [starts playing piano]

JOHN: [laughs] Is it?

RINGO: —come on, play that thing!

JOHN: [laughs] Is it?

RINGO: Yeah. [laughs] Oh come on, Ringo, you really know how to swing! One of those.

### Notes

Early discussion of what will become 'Octopus's Garden', one of Ringo's most beloved compositions. Ringo's self-deprecating humor about George's hypothetical song for him is typical of the group's banter.

### Overview

January 22nd, 1969 (Apple Studios, London): As the band works on 'I've Got A Feeling', an earlier conversation about Martin Luther King Jr. inspires Paul to improvise a line. John suggests they have a song about dreams as their last single. (Note: John could be thinking of Johnnie Taylor's 'I Had A Dream' or Ray Charles' 'I Had A Dream'.)

### Dialogue

PAUL: All that I've been looking for was somebody who looks like you / I had a dream this afternoon!

JOHN: I think somebody's written it, actually.

PAUL: Oh.

JOHN: I have a feeling some spade wrote one called 'I Had A Dream'.

PAUL: Oh, yeah. [pause] I have a dream…

JOHN: We could make it our last single.

### Notes

Paul's improvisation on 'I've Got A Feeling' is gently deflated by John's recognition of prior songs with similar themes. John's dated language reflects the period. The reference to making it "our last single" is darkly prescient given the band's impending dissolution.

### Overview

January 23rd, 1969 (Apple Studios, London): Gallery owner Robert Fraser drops in on the sessions to find the lights in the studio blown out after a circuit overload. Yoko asks Robert (who hosted John and Yoko's You Are Here art show) whether he's already seen John and Yoko's short films, and Robert enquires about the anvil in the room (which is being used for 'Maxwell's Silver Hammer') which John makes fun of, comparing it to a conceptual art piece. Paul, who has been playing the piano, chats with Robert about the song.

### Dialogue

PAUL: We're having a bit of trouble. [laughs]

ROBERT: Oh no.

JOHN: Not one emergency light in all of them!

ROBERT: You should have a candle. Or I'll give you a candle. Is that piece of anvil from [inaudible]?

JOHN: Yes, it's a Henry Moore we had brought in.

ROBERT: Yeah.

JOHN: Henry Moore's anvil.

ROBERT: Very phallic. [pause]

PAUL: [laughs] It's just a reminder. To remind you about 'Maxwell's Silver Hammer' all the time. An anvil that will never be removed. Bang bang Maxwell's silver hammer…

ROBERT: Was this, um, a blacksmith's place, before? [Paul laughs] In the basement?

PAUL: This is Mal's instrument. For a song called 'Maxwell's Silver Hammer'.

ROBERT: Oh I see, yeah.

PAUL: When Mal hits it. "Bang bang, Maxwell's silver hammer."

ROBERT: Why did you decide it had to be an anvil?

PAUL: It was just that – you see, it was just that sound that came to me one day. A silver hammer on an anvil.

ROBERT: Yeah. Very refined. Really terrific.

### Notes

Robert Fraser was a prominent London art dealer and friend of the Beatles. His comment "Very phallic" about the anvil prompts John's deadpan Henry Moore reference, showing the intersection of the Beatles' world with the London art scene. Paul's earnest explanation of 'Maxwell's Silver Hammer' contrasts with the absurdist humor around it.
