### Overview

George introduces ‘I Me Mine’ to Paul and Michael Lindsay-Hogg and frets over the grammar of “flowing more freely than wine.” Paul and Michael push him toward “freely” over “freer”, and the exchange turns jokey on how the word looks and sounds.

### Dialogue

GEORGE: Uh, is that grammatic? “Flowing more freely than wine.”

MICHAEL: Yeah.

GEORGE: “Flowing much ‘freer’”? [pause] “Freer”?

MICHAEL: “Flowing more ‘freely’.”

PAUL: “Freely.” “Freer.”

GEORGE: It’s funny in writing, yeah – thinking of how you say it—

PAUL: “Freer.” For it’s sticky out here. [general laughter]

GEORGE: But I was thinking, “freer” – if there was a such a word as “freer”, is it f-r-e-e-e-r—

MICHAEL: No, it’s f-r-e-e-r, it’s f-r-e-e-r.

GEORGE: “Free—”

PAUL: Like “queer”, “freer”. [laughs] “Freer”, “queer”.

### Notes

Shows George’s attention to lyric nuance and Paul’s punny, sound-first instinct. Also shows Michael acting as a kind of language coach.

### Overview

John and Paul blast through a comic, Elvis-ish take on ‘Two Of Us’. The master notes only flag the performance; no verbatim dialogue is given beyond the song title.

### Dialogue

N/A

### Notes

Performance/reference only: “Two of us wearing postcards…” in Elvis style. Useful tone reference for how loose and playful they can be with even fragile material.

## 3

### Overview

John, with George singing along, performs a strain of Hank Williams’ ‘You Win Again’. It’s another example of country/Americana seeping naturally into the sessions.

### Dialogue

JOHN: The news is out all over town / That you’ve been seen out and around / I know that I can’t win but then / What can I do / You win again…

### Notes

Brief, but reinforces John’s affinity for country material and the way “older” songs surface as emotional shorthand.

### Overview

George plays ‘I Me Mine’ for John, who eats, opens Paul’s mail, and half-teases the song as being “hard to do” and more like something for a commercial. George keeps gamely playing; John riffs on possible visuals and characters.

### Dialogue

JOHN: Is that the end of it?

GEORGE: Yeah. It’s only that long—

JOHN: We can use it for a commercial. [laughs; bored] So uh, yeah. It’s fine. And what do we do about that?

GEORGE: Um, well, it’s just a bit – you see—

JOHN: It sounds so hard to do.

GEORGE: No, it’s… no.

JOHN: I mean, for you.

GEORGE: No.

JOHN: [falsetto] I me mine… You know, all that singing.

GEORGE: [starts playing again] All through the day, I me mine, I me mine, I me mine… All through the night, I me mine, I me mine, I me mine… No one’s frightened of leaving it, everyone’s weaving it, coming on strong all the time…

JOHN: [operatic] I me my me my me my me my oh…

GEORGE: All I can hear… [starts playing forcefully] I me mine – I me mine – I me mine…

JOHN: All the girls can come on and dance it. Hari [Krishna]s and fisherwives, and dwarves, and hunchbacks…

GEORGE: Even your tears, I me mine, I me mine, I me mine… No one’s frightened of playing it, everyone’s saying it, flowing more freely than wine…

JOHN: [derisive] Run along, son. [laughs] See you later. We’re a rock ‘n’ roll band, you know. Bom bo bom bo bom bo bom bo bom…

### Notes

One of the clearest illustrations of George bringing serious work and John undercutting it with jokey distance. Also connects to the earlier “freely/freer” grammar conversation.

### Overview

After John dismisses the songs he’s brought for the project, Paul presses him on whether he’s written anything new. John hasn’t; Paul warns they’ll face a crisis without material. John promises, a bit flippantly, to deliver “a little rock ‘n’ roller.”

### Dialogue

PAUL: Haven’t you written anything?

JOHN: [defiant] No.

PAUL: [tense] Haven’t you. [pause] We’ll be faced with a crisis, you know.

JOHN: When I’m up against the wall, Paul, you’ll find I’m on my best—

PAUL: Yeah, I know, I know, but I just wish you’d come up with the goods.

JOHN: Now, look. I think I’ve got Sunday off.

PAUL: Yeah, well, I hope that you can deliver.

JOHN: I’m hoping for a little rock ‘n’ roller.

PAUL: [sarcastic] Yeah, I was hoping for the same thing, myself, you know.

JOHN: [mocking] “Sammy loved his mammy, she hammy dammy dammy…” 

### Notes

Nicely encapsulates their creative codependence: Paul as planner and worrier about “goods,” John as last-minute inspiration merchant.

### Overview

George recalls writing ‘Don’t Bother Me’ in Bournemouth while ill, and how the others drank his tonic to get high. It’s a light reminiscence that underlines how long-standing their habits and roles are.

### Dialogue

GEORGE: [laughs] I remember that on my sickbed in Bournemouth. In fact, that’s what it was. You know I was in bed in Bournemouth, where we were on a summer season [laughs], and the doctor gave me some – some tonic, which had some amphetamine or something in it. Remember? And you all, like, drank it to get high. Just [inaudible] got you high. [inaudible] And that’s when I wrote that one. 

### Notes

Anchors ‘Don’t Bother Me’ in specific Beatles lore and the band’s casual attitude toward “tonics” and stimulants.

## 7

### Overview

George leads a preliminary run-through of ‘I Me Mine’ and comments on John and Yoko’s dancing. Their waltz will later appear in the Let It Be film. The line may or may not carry an edge.

### Dialogue

GEORGE: I don’t think you’re dancing right, John.

### Notes

Tiny moment, but emblematic of George’s mixture of dry humour and possible passive-aggression toward John/Yoko’s performance-art tendencies.

## 8

### Overview

An uneasy Michael tries to bring the conversation back to logistics of the TV film. Paul sings a bit of Carl Perkins’ ‘Your True Love’; John improvises a mock-romantic line (“You stole into my heart like a creeping nun…”), twisting it into wordplay.

### Dialogue

JOHN: You stole into my heart like a creeping nun… My arteries were overwhelmed. 

MICHAEL: That would be pretty good like as a melody.

JOHN: A malady?

### Notes

Shows John’s instinct to pun and undercut sentiment even while improvising something that could be a genuine melody line, and Michael’s ever-present “show builder” brain.
