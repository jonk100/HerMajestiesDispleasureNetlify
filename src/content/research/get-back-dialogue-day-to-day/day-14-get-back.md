# 26 January 1969

## 1

### Overview

January 26th, 1969: Paul arrives at the studio accompanied by Linda and Heather just as George and Ringo are working out the melody for 'Octopus's Garden' on the piano. John, who has been playing around on drums, chimes in none too discreetly with a question he's been eager to ask Paul.

### Dialogue

JOHN: Hey! Did you dream about me last night?

PAUL: [long pause] I can't remember.

JOHN: Very strong dream. We both dreamt about it. It was amazing! Different dreams, you know, but I thought you must've been there. [inaudible] I was touching you. [inaudible]

PAUL: Nothing to worry about, though?

JOHN: Nothing to worry about, no.

### Notes

One of the most intimate and revealing exchanges in the sessions. John's eagerness to share his dream about Paul—in which he was "touching" him—and his assumption that Paul must have had the same dream shows the depth of their psychic connection. Paul's cautious response ("Nothing to worry about, though?") suggests both curiosity and unease. John's reassurance is gentle.

### Overview

January 26th, 1969 (Apple Studios, London): As the Beatles work on the arrangement for Octopus's Garden', Ringo tells Paul about the basis for the song, piquing George's memory of what he was once told about octopuses. (Note: John's on drums. This clip from the sessions is shortly followed by Heather sharing her personal octopus anecdote with John—which I can't make out, unfortunately—and more animal banter.)

### Dialogue

GEORGE: Hey, it was somebody – he was telling me octopuses go and pick up all the seashells. You know about that?

RINGO: Yes, that's why I wrote it! 'Cause the guides told me [about them] on the boat in Sardinia. [inaudible]

GEORGE: Yeah. [to Paul] You know about that? They collect all nice-looking things and make a garden around where they are and just with all their groovy things to sleep behind.

RINGO: Yeah.

GEORGE: [laughs] It's great.

### Notes

The origin story of 'Octopus's Garden'—Ringo learned about octopuses' nest-building behavior from boat guides in Sardinia. George's enthusiasm for the natural world comes through clearly. The song represents Ringo's desire for a peaceful underwater escape, a telling metaphor during these tense sessions.

### Overview

January 26th, 1969 (Apple Studio): While Paul, George, and Ringo work on the arrangement for 'Octopus's Garden', John teases Paul and Linda's daughter Heather about her new pets.

### Dialogue

HEATHER: We've got some baby kittens only about that big—

JOHN: Are you going to eat them?

HEATHER: No!

JOHN: Lots of people do, you know. I don't, I mean.

HEATHER: Kittens that have just been born yesterday, or a few days—

PAUL: On toast? On toast?

JOHN: You put pastry around them, and then you have cat pie.

HEATHER: A few days they were just born, weren't they?

JOHN: Oh, you'd better wait a week or two before you eat them.

HEATHER: No, I'm never going to eat them!

JOHN: Aren't you? Well, that's very good.

HEATHER: And then we took the grown-ups, and one of them's beautiful, like this Daddy cat. It's got a big black spot there—

JOHN: Oh, you don't eat them if they have black spots.

HEATHER: The other one's like a tiger.

JOHN: You don't eat them if they're like tigers, either. [laughter]

HEATHER: You don't eat any cats! They don't taste good. [general laughter] And anyway, I'm just a pussycat who was just born.

JOHN: Are you?

PAUL: Okay, pussycat.

JOHN: There's a good dog. Puss.

…

HEATHER: Stop keep – stop keep calling me "dog", I'm a cat.

JOHN: Okay, cat.

### Notes

John's playful teasing of six-year-old Heather shows his gentle side with children, despite the shock-humor approach. Heather holds her own, firmly correcting him and insisting cats don't taste good. Paul joins in the absurdist banter. This lighter moment provides relief from the band's tensions.

### Overview

January 26th, 1969: While listening to a playback of 'For You Blue', Paul and Linda's daughter Heather tells everyone about her pet kittens, and starts a discussion amongst John, Yoko, Paul, Linda, and George about their cat food preferences.

### Dialogue

HEATHER: Then the other kittens will have other kittens, then the other kittens—listen, Paul!—then you know, the other babies will have other babies and the other babies will have other babies, and the other babies will have other babies… and then some will have to be in our room, and in your room, and in everybody's room! And then it'll be too much.

…

JOHN: And they always make cat food tins too small.

…

JOHN: [laughs] I give them ping pong balls. [Heather roars]

### Notes

Heather's escalating kitten multiplication prophecy is both charming and prophetic—like the Beatles' problems, the kittens will exponentially multiply until "it'll be too much." John's comment about cat food tins and ping pong balls shows his attentiveness to domestic details.

### Overview

January 26th, 1969 (Apple Studios, London): After a couple dozen takes of 'Let It Be', John and George betray their restlessness and hunger, while Paul suggests a couple more takes before they take a break. John and Paul converse in mock-German.

### Dialogue

JOHN: Should we do it once more and have dinner? It must be our dinner cooking, nobody else lives here.

GEORGE: Is that food? Cooking?

### Notes

Simple exchange showing the physical toll of extended recording sessions. The joke that "nobody else lives here" acknowledges how much time they're spending at Apple Studios. Paul's drive to get one more take conflicts with the others' hunger.
