# 31 January 1969

## 1

### Overview

January 31st, 1969 (Apple Studios, London): John sings harmony with Paul in a lackadaisical take of 'Oh! Darling', until Paul picks up the tempo at the end.

### Dialogue

N/A

### Notes

Brief reference to a performance of 'Oh! Darling'. The description as "lackadaisical" suggests the band's energy levels are waning after weeks of intensive sessions. This would be just before or around the famous rooftop concert on January 30th, 1969, which served as the climax of the Get Back/Let It Be project.
