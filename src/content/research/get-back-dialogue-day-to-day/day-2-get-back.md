### Overview

John allies himself with Paul as they work through different lyric and harmony options for the chorus of ‘Don’t Let Me Down’. George tries repeatedly to offer ideas and grows frustrated as his suggestions are overridden or deferred. This is the first major “Paul vs. George” creative friction in the Get Back/Let It Be sessions.

### Dialogue

GEORGE: If what you’re saying is what [John] said, then it’s easy, ’cause if you don’t know the words, then he tells you what you’re saying.

PAUL: Yeah I know, but you see, like you said, it was corny before, and so to change the corniness, I was changing the words—

GEORGE: Yeah, but the corny beginsel I thought was the notes that he was doing, you know, and the way he was doing it, not really what he was saying— 

PAUL: Yeah. So – okay.

GEORGE: —and if it seems good, it doesn’t matter what—

PAUL: What I’m trying to say is, you can get – I think you can get around the beginsel by singing the corny notes first, and having new words, and – you know. So I’m – but it’s like – so we still have to try and do it. So you still keep saying it’s wrong. Well, let’s try it. And then when we’ve tried it, then we can see if it’s wrong, you know.

GEORGE: You already seem to have tried it a lot.

PAUL: Yeah, I know, but we haven’t – we still haven’t done this. I’m in love for the first time in my life. “Don’t you know it’s gonna last.” [pause] “I’ll never let it get away.” [laughs] It’s a love that lasts forever…

JOHN: “Forever and a day.”

PAUL: Yeah. There’s some – there’s some new words there. And – and guitar–

JOHN: I just haven’t tied to a way of singing yet.

PAUL: No, that’s what I mean, you know, that’s all I want – to just have them–

JOHN: Can you both do it, ’cause – okay.

PAUL: Yeah. I’m in love for the first time…

PAUL & GEORGE: For the first time in my life…

JOHN: Don’t you know it’s gonna last…

PAUL & GEORGE: Don’t ever let it get away…

JOHN: It’s a love that lasts forever…

GEORGE: I just wanna say— [playing halts]

PAUL: [to George] I just want to get a bit – we’ll try, you know. We’ll go right through. But you keep talking about it. 

GEORGE: You see, if he was, say, if it was like— [plays different rhythm] Like that, you know. “You know it’s gonna last.”

PAUL: [impatient] Yeah, sure, let’s just repeat whatever you say.

GEORGE: Don’t you know it’s gonna last…

JOHN & PAUL: I’m in love for the first time…

PAUL & GEORGE: For the first time in my life…

JOHN: Don’t you know it’s gonna last…

PAUL & GEORGE: Don’t you know it’s gonna last…

JOHN: It’s a love that lasts forever…

PAUL & GEORGE: It’s a love that lasts forever…

JOHN: It’s a love that has no past…

PAUL & GEORGE: It’s a love that has no past…

JOHN: Don’t let me down… [playing halts]

PAUL: Okay, that’s – that’s alright. That’s—

JOHN: Yes. [to George] I can’t hear you.

GEORGE: Right.

PAUL: No, uh—

GEORGE: I think it’s awful. I’m trying to get it started—

PAUL: Uh… okay.

JOHN: [to George] Well, have you got anything? To supplant it?

PAUL: [to George] Okay, yeah, come on. Do something better, then.

GEORGE: Well, I just think that, you know– I think, for a start, it’d be better to sing – [plays descending chords] instead of— [plays repeating chords] Ah… For the first time…

PAUL: Yeah, but see, in a way, that’s even cornier, I think. That – that little harmony bit, it’s just too – it’s too pretty.

GEORGE: Well it’s just there’s one holding – it’s like that. [plays staggered chords] I mean at the moment, it’s just— [plays straight chords] And maybe it’s cornier if you do [plays staggered chords], a groove like that—

PAUL: Yeah.

GEORGE: But if it’s something like that— [plays sustained chords]

PAUL: Okay. Now for the first time in my life… One, two, three – you take the lower one, then.

JOHN: I’m in love for the first time…

PAUL & GEORGE: I’m in love for the first time…

JOHN: Don’t you know it’s gonna last…

PAUL & GEORGE: Don’t you know it’s gonna last…

JOHN: It’s a love that lasts forever…

PAUL & GEORGE: It’s a love that lasts forever…

JOHN: It’s a love that has no past!

PAUL & GEORGE: It’s a love that has no past… [playing halts]

GEORGE: I thought we should do something like this— [plays different rhythm]

PAUL: No. You see—

GEORGE: [continues playing] It’s a love that lasts forever, love that lasts forever, love that lasts forever…

JOHN: [unconvinced] Yeah, well, that’s it. [pause] I think you should just get a corny one first, and then start doing that bit. You know, you’ll start to get the rhythm to it, and then sort of change it.

GEORGE: [plays differently] Love that’s gonna last… Da da da da da da…

PAUL: Yeah, that’s it. [George continues playing] Uh… [George’s playing halts] Let’s just sing, you know, the corny one. [laughs]

JOHN: Yeah, do the corny one.

PAUL: Just to get this bit, you know. And then we can like – you see, that’s it. We’ll make it better as it goes on.

JOHN: Yeah. I mean – I—

PAUL: But if we don’t, then it just doesn’t go on. You know, we’ve just gone round for like an hour, with nothing in our heads. Just— And we’re back, you know. So let’s—

GEORGE: I can keep doing the permutations, then.

PAUL: Yeah, I know, but let’s just sort of move on, now. Let’s just get this.

JOHN: I’d like to hear any of ‘em – right ones.

PAUL: Yeah. Right, okay. So repeat exactly what he says, but then we can’t, on one of the lines. So, I’m in love for the first time…

GEORGE: See, that’s why you don’t get any further, because you just kept using the same lines against the one that doesn’t work—

PAUL: [ignores] For the first time in my life…

JOHN: Don’t you know it’s gonna last…

GEORGE: [grudging] It’s a love that’s gonna last…

JOHN: It’s a love that lasts forever…

PAUL & GEORGE: It’s a love that lasts forever…

JOHN: It’s a love that has no past… [playing halts] Love that lasts forever, love that lasts…

PAUL: Okay, so how about, how about – changing ‘round these two, and when you sing, “don’t you know it’s gonna last,” we sing, “it’s a love that has no past.” And then we repeat, “it’s a love that lasts forever,” exactly. And then when you sing, “it’s a love that has no past,” we sing “it’s a love that’s gonna last.”

JOHN: Yes. I agree.

PAUL: Okay? So, I’m in love for the— “Love for the first time in my life.” “It’s a love that has no past.” Swap that one for the other. So that when he’s singing that, we’re singing the other. Then, “it’s a love that lasts forever,” repeat that – even though it sounds funny, it’ll be alright. And then, “don’t you know it’s gonna last.” Just try it through, roughly.

GEORGE: I’m trying to—

PAUL: Listen – uh, uh.

JOHN: I’m in love for the first time…

PAUL & GEORGE: Love for the first time in my life…

JOHN: Don’t you know it’s gonna last…

PAUL & GEORGE: It’s a love that has no past…

JOHN: It’s a love that lasts forever… [playing halts]

PAUL: Okay, uh, The only time that works, really, is on the last line. So we sing, “love for the first time—” Just, just try it all exactly as it is. Repeating that. We’ll just on the last time. Sing, repeat, “it’s a love that’s gonna last,” and then you say, “it’s a love that has no past.”

JOHN: Okay.

PAUL: You see, it’s verging between ridiculous and alright, that, you know. Singing different words. ’Cause it is like—

JOHN: That’s the bones of it, though. [inaudible; playing guitar] She’s in, she’s in pain, you know. [laughs]

PAUL: [laughs] Okay.

JOHN: I’m in love for the first time…

PAUL & GEORGE: For the first time in my life…

JOHN: Don’t you know it’s gonna last…

PAUL & GEORGE: Don’t you know it’s gonna last…

JOHN: It’s a love that lasts forever…

PAUL & GEORGE: It’s a love that lasts forever…

JOHN: It’s a love that has no past…

PAUL & GEORGE: It’s a love that’s gonna last…

GEORGE: Can I make a suggestion there, for the last line?

PAUL: What?

GEORGE: Well, forget the last line. It’s a love that lasts forever…

PAUL: It’s a love that has no past… dun dun dun dun dun dun. Don’t let me down… Okay.

### Notes

Early, extended Paul–George conflict around arrangement and “corniness” of ‘Don’t Let Me Down’ chorus. Shows John siding musically with Paul while trying to mediate, and George’s growing feeling that he can’t get ideas through.

---

## 2

### Overview

Further work on the ‘Don’t Let Me Down’ chorus. George is skeptical about the arrangement; Paul insists it will be improved and focuses on rhythm and weak spots. John supports Paul’s assessment that the problem is structural rather than purely melodic.

### Dialogue

PAUL: So that’s – that’s near enough for the time being. [inaudible]

JOHN: We’ve still got that hole, like at the—

GEORGE: But really, it’s like that doesn’t sound all that… you know. I’m iffy on that.

PAUL: Well, we’re gonna improve on that. But the—

GEORGE: If we had a tape recorder now – just tape down, play it back, you’d throw that out straightaway.

PAUL: Yeah, right, but—

GEORGE: You know, really—

PAUL: Yeah—

GEORGE: —you’d throw it out right damn in—

PAUL: Okay. Uh. Well, okay, that’s the—

GEORGE: You know, it’s either be— I know, you know.

PAUL: Yeah, I know, but you— [makes helpless sound]

JOHN: [mediating] See, I think, there… [starts playing]

PAUL: [to John] Give in!

GEORGE: I’m in love for the first time…

PAUL: I give in.

JOHN: We’re right, but it’s wrong there, on that bit.

GEORGE: You see, the first one’s not bad. [playing halts]

JOHN: No, the thing that we’ve done is that we found out that’s the weak bit, right.

PAUL: Yeah.

JOHN: So we tried putting voices on it. But it’s still down to the rhythm, somehow. The ba— Love for the first time… [starts playing]

PAUL: But it was always weak on your guitar.

JOHN: [agreeing] Yeah, sure.

PAUL: That’s the weak bit of the song, that.

### Notes

Shorter exchange that crystallizes the structural problem with the chorus and John’s view of it as a “weak bit” in need of rhythmic, not just vocal, adjustment. Continues the pattern of George’s skepticism and Paul’s insistence that the part can be refined.

## 3

### Overview

Paul, George, and John argue over process: whether to keep playing through a “confused” arrangement or stop and methodically fix parts. Paul is acutely aware that he sounds like a director; George insists you only find what works by playing. John acts as mediator and offers practical suggestions (vamping, structure), while Paul openly worries about filming and time pressure.

### Dialogue

PAUL: You see, we’re really – we’re gonna have to sorta bring it together, because we’re all at odds, we’re doing that thing we did on The Beatles, we’re all playing, you know, like… [incoherent] Like in this verse, it’s two harmonies singing, trying to say some words, right. So like you know, you can just, duh duh dun… ch cha. And in the bits, when we need bits, we’re not—

JOHN: Yeah I know the bits. I’m just trying to sing it, and do it through.

PAUL: [plays] You know what I mean? We’ve got to get riffs, when the riff bits come up.

GEORGE: The riffs. Uh, there’s no riffs. I mean, it’s nice to get – just to get what you’re playing—

PAUL: No, but it’s just, look – you see, “you and I”, uh – on—

GEORGE: You and I, our memories…

PAUL: Uh, but it’s not – it’s not together, you see, so it’s not sounding together. Even on—

GEORGE: So we can only play until we – until we can find the bit—

PAUL: Or we can stop and say it’s not together.

GEORGE: Yes, then you’ve got to carry on until we get it together. So I mean, that’s all, that’s all I can do is play—

PAUL: Okay. Well, I, you know—

GEORGE: —until it sounds as though it’s blending with the rest—

PAUL: I never know what to say to that, you know, ’cause what I want to say is now come on, and play… you know.

GEORGE: Yes, I know.

PAUL: But I can’t, you know, because we get into that line.

GEORGE: It does.

PAUL: Okay. [laughs nervously] So, here we go. [starts playing] You know, I mean, well. Tell us something about that. I can’t make it eyond that. It’s like, it’s – it’s complicated now. So. See, if we can get simpler, and then complicate it where it needs complications, but it’s complicated in the bit—

GEORGE: It’s not complicated. I’m just gonna—

PAUL: I know, but I mean – you know.

GEORGE: I mean, I’ll play just the chords, if you’ll like, and—

PAUL: [hushed] No, come on, you always get like—

GEORGE: —and then – but that’s all I’m trying to do—

PAUL: [anxious] You always get annoyed when I say that. I’m – I’m trying to help, you know, but I always hear myself annoying you, and I’m trying to—

GEORGE: No, you’re not annoying me.

PAUL: —I get so I can’t say—

GEORGE: [acquiescent] You don’t annoy me [anymore?].

PAUL: But you know what I mean. You know, well, do this, then. [plays] And then… I don’t know. [long pause] Yeah. I can’t do it on film, either. [laughs; bleak] I don’t know if I can do it on camera. [long silence; guitar playing]

JOHN: Do you want me to keep this up? [plays riff] ’Cause I’m trying to find something that’s nice to sing to—

PAUL: Yeah, you see, I don’t mind—

JOHN: Yeah, and—

PAUL: —but doesn’t everyone agree that it’s confused at the moment?

JOHN: Yeah.

PAUL: So all I’m trying to say is – is like, let’s get the confusion unconfusing, and then confuse it. You know, like, we’re just – this is what we’ve been doing all afternoon. This is why we’re not getting anything done. You know, we’re just rolling on with it. We’ve only got twelve more days. So you know, we’ve really got to do this methodically, this one. Like unconfused, then a bit more confused, then a bit more, now try this drumming here, try this drumming there, now okay, let’s stop and go look into this bit—

JOHN: Well, I’ve got an idea. I should vamp, ’cause I’ve got to sing, and it’s hard going— [plays rhythm]

PAUL: Doing that?

JOHN: But it’s annoying, you know. And let me do it— [plays rhythm]

PAUL: Okay, can you do that—

JOHN: I’ll do just that kind of vamping. [plays rhythm]

PAUL: Yeah. [laughs] Drag it halfway through candid camera. [long pause; listening to John playing] Yeah.

JOHN: [reassuring] Forget about candid camera.

PAUL: [wan] Can’t, though. [quietly; to George] But you see we’ve been saying— [inaudible] —a lot of, uh— [inaudible] —that I can do about. You know, it’s like I’ve always found that – but I always feel it, though, like you think I’m trying to put you down, or stop you from playing, but I’m not. I’m trying to stop us all playing, until we know what we’re playing.

GEORGE: Yeah, but you’ve got to play it in order to find which fits and which doesn’t.

PAUL: Mm.

GEORGE: You see, that’s all you can do in this—

PAUL: But it’s like – I know, but I’m thinking of this other thing which is where we’re playing the solos. We’re improvising the solos, but we’ll play strict chords and strict rhythms.

GEORGE: Yeah.

PAUL: Without the vocals.

GEORGE: [inaudible; drowned out by playing]

PAUL: You know, but I don’t want to say it, because I really just hear myself as being the only one saying it. Always. And I just basically sort of sit there, like— [inaudible; drowned out by playing] —and I never get any support or anything. So I just think, “Oh well. [inaudible]” You know. It’s right. [to John] And you know it’s right.

JOHN: [consenting] Yes, alright, but I just don’t know what to do about it.

PAUL: Well, you know.

JOHN: You know, I mean, up ’til then—

GEORGE: I mean, I’ll wait until you figure out your bits and then work my part out, if you like.

PAUL: No no no—

GEORGE: It’s like that, it’s like a matter of working it out with you while you’re working your bit out. You know, if you’ve got your bass bit. [plays] You know, I mean, so. It just would—

PAUL: I know, I know, but I’m—

GEORGE: Because it’ll take even longer in a way, if there—

PAUL: Look, I’m not trying to say that, and I’m not trying to say that about you. You know, you’re doing this again as though I’m trying to say that, and what we said the other day, you know – I’m not trying to get [at] you. But what I really am trying to just say is, “Look, lads.” The band, you know. “Should we try it like this?” You know.

GEORGE: It’s funny now how it only occurs when you put the – on—

PAUL: I know, if this one is like, “Should we play guitar all through ‘Hey Jude’?” Well, I don’t think we should, but—

GEORGE: Well, okay, I don’t mind, I’ll play, you know, whatever you want me to play. Or I won’t play at all, if you don’t want me to play. Now, whatever it is that will please you, I’ll do it. [pause] But I don’t think you really know what that one is. [long pause; playing]

JOHN: [hedging] But do you want to take the [inaudible]?

GEORGE: [singing quietly] Going nowhere…

PAUL: [exasperated] No, okay, but don’t – come on. Look, you know—

JOHN: The galloping bit. And I’ll just vamp.

PAUL: Look, you know, the… [sighs] No, it’s not like that. You see, that’s it, it’s like, we can’t do this. We’ve really got to sort out this, ’cause we’re – this is  – we’re like – this is the one, you know. Now we’re rehearsing, and we’re trying to like get it together for a TV show, so we really – like you said, we’ve only been through four numbers, you know.

GEORGE: Mm.

JOHN: Well…

PAUL: So we’ve probably got to get some system to get through like twenty, or thirty, and no more, and have learnt them. And it’s probably going to be like sculpture. So that we get all the chords. So we can all vamp and all. Then we can all play, like, every solo we need. But like… You know what I mean? It’s got to sound as though it’s improving.

GEORGE: [careful] Yeah, well, it actually – it sounded to me, that for me, it was a waste of me time playing, when we started it today. I mean, I just started remembering then what it could get into the other day, after playing for around an hour, an hour and a half. And suddenly, you know, I just don’t find that my – that what I’m doing is starting to have something, you know. Have some structure to it. [pause] You know, that’s the thing.

PAUL: Yeah, I know, I know what you mean, you know. ’Cause it’s like—

GEORGE: You know, I mean—

PAUL: It’s just that that way of doing it, you know, puts me off the way I’m trying to do it, and—

GEORGE: [resigned] Well, that’s – you know. That’s all, then. I can only do me, in that one way, however I do it, you know. [long pause]

PAUL: [resigned] Let’s do another song.

GEORGE: [commiserating] No, come on, we just have to learn this—

PAUL: No, no, it’s – let’s just do something else.

GEORGE: Do you want to do… ‘Maxwell Silver Hammer’?

JOHN: [encouraging] Well, let’s do this, ’cause then we – we’re gonna come to this, or whatever it is. And the thing is just try and think what – the stage we’ve got to be in then.

PAUL: You just have to know that. I think we’ve wasted a lot of time, I think. I think we do like waste, physically waste a heck of a lot of time, you know, when the four of us are together.

### Notes

Defines the core “process” disagreement between Paul and George: stop and fix vs. play until it gels. Shows Paul’s anxiety about being the only one saying “this is confused,” his awareness of annoying George, and John’s role as mediator.

## 4

### Overview

Later in the day, Paul, John, and George discuss leadership, songs as “your scene”, and the difficulty of being “the boss”. Paul acknowledges he has been effectively leading for a couple of years and is now scared of that role; George insists that Paul doesn’t “boss out” on them and that the group’s slowness is partly due to lack of clear direction.

### Dialogue

GEORGE: But that’s like, I’ve learnt that bit, and I’m trying to – I’m trying to take that – those chords along with it…

PAUL: [inaudible; drowned out by George’s voice] I’m not trying to – I only want to ask you. You know.

JOHN: I think, it’s your song. And you’ve gotta— [inaudible] —gotta have it exactly how he wants to do it, you know. If you say, “Don’t play that, play that,” it’s up to you, you know. You sort of take it. ’Cause it’s your scene. If somebody’s gonna ask for [inaudible], it’s his song.

PAUL: But now I – now I’m scared of that. To be the boss. And I – and I have been, for like, uh, a couple of years. And we all have, you know. There’s no pretending about that.

JOHN: Yeah I know, but – but this—

PAUL: And no one is [the boss]. That is what we decided, you know. And no one is—

JOHN: But it’s all in—

PAUL: And no one’s – you know how rush— [audio cuts off] —and this is why, you know, it’s chaos—

GEORGE: You don’t boss out on us. It’s fine.

PAUL: Until it sort of… That’s why we take so long! Because, really, you know, and we get sort of – so that’s the thing. We can play it shitty and all. I – I think we can play it shitty like ten times, so it’s sort of in there, and then I think we can kind of play it quite good, then. But it’s only – I don’t know, it’s just like different approaches, you know. I think we’d be better just learn, just doing it all, like uh, you know, the Red Norvo Five. Just really, like, uh—

GEORGE: Vamping away.

PAUL: Vamping, sort of efficient vamping, really, you know, and then get the imaginative thing. You know. [pauses] But anyway, I know it’s impossible for us to go like – because we can’t get into the moment, ’cause you don’t do it like that, and— [plays riff]

GEORGE: I know, and I’m trying, but— [plays]

PAUL: No no no I mean, just, generally… [John sings ‘Two Of Us’ under his breath] It’s like when you’ve been trying to get me to do it and I do it. And that’s how I do it, but that’s not how you do it. [everyone plays]

JOHN: [laughs; stops playing] See, I suppose that’s how they do it.

### Notes

Important self-awareness moment for Paul about his reluctant leadership and fear of being “the boss”. John explicitly affirms the songwriter’s right to direct their own song; George tries to reassure Paul he doesn’t feel bossed.

---

## 5

### Overview

Paul proposes a structural solution to conflicting working methods: each Beatle should have undivided creative direction over their own compositions, with improvisation agreed upon explicitly. George likes the idea; John prefers improvisation. Paul muses that their discord is “far further reaching” than just music.

### Dialogue

PAUL: [inaudible; drowned out by guitar] —of seeing yourself nearly go round a past you’ve been down too many times, you know I go down it, you know, like us going on about this. I really don’t want to go back to that. And it’s just silly. And I just can’t think of any solution out of here. The problem is that we should all arrange our own tunes, and if you want improvisation, then we should just say, you know, right, and—

GEORGE: That’s the best way.

PAUL: —and we improvise here. But look, it puts on much more work on each one of us, then, because then you’ve got to work out my bassline.

JOHN: I’d say improvise it, like.

PAUL: Yeah. [laughs bleakly] It’s like a bunch of theories, isn’t it? It’s like, it’s not just to do with playing music, this. It’s far further reaching, this sort of – this thing, you know.

GEORGE: It’s always the far reaching end of it. It stems from the mad thing they call— [audio cuts off]

### Notes

Sets up the idea (that will later partly come true) of each member having their own “domain” on their songs. Also shows Paul’s sense that their disagreements are metaphysical, not just technical.
