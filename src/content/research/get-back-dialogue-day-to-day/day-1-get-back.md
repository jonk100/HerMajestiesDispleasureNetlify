## Day 1 Overview (January 3, 1969)

### Beat 1

#### Context & Proposal:

- While waiting for John and George to arrive in the studio, Paul noodles on the piano and plays Samuel Barber’s ‘Adagio For Strings’. No dialogue.

### Beat 2

- In an amiable chat, George and Ringo admire Paul’s beard, George expresses his interest in The Band’s unorthodox living arrangements and drummer Levon Helm’s easygoing demeanour (comparing him favourably to Ringo), and Paul and George enthusiastically encourage Ringo’s songwriting efforts in spite of Ringo’s own admitted frustrations with his limited grasp of chords (ergo compositional range).

### Beat 3

- The Beatles slide into a jam of The Coasters’ ‘Three Cool Cats’.

### Beat 4

- During a nostalgic jam session, the Beatles turn out a perfectly solid rendition of Anton Karas’ theme for The Third Man.

### Beat 5

- The Beatles revisit an early Lennon-McCartney number.

### Beat 6

- The Beatles revisit ‘One After 909’, a song from from the Quarrymen days, and play it for the first time during the Get Back/Let It Be sessions.

### Beat 7

- The Beatles revisit ‘One After 909’ again, this time with Ringo leading the charge.

### Beat 8

- John and Paul sing a strain from an early Lennon-McCartney composition. 

### Beat 9

#### Context & Proposal:

- John suggests riding the momentum from the Get Back sessions and going directly into a new album afterward
- Goal is to avoid their previous pattern of long breaks between recording sessions, which has affected band chemistry and led to complacency
- John's wording ambiguously hints at (or doesn't) an eventual Beatles breakup

#### Paul & George's Response:

- Both express optimism about the band's future prospects as long as they remain focused

#### George's Perspective:

- On rehearsal: Stresses the importance of rehearsing together until every number is memorized, enabling them to perform onstage without insecurities and with complete confidence in themselves and each other
- On past frustrations: Admits the pain and tedium has previously frustrated his resolve in his own compositions and discouraged his involvement in the band (particularly with others' songs)
- On necessary effort: Acknowledges that despite the difficulty, this process is necessary and that raw hours of conscientious effort are required to get anywhere
- On band unity: Contends the Beatles could realign as a band greater than the sum of their parts if everyone approaches every song with the same care and creativity as if it were their own
- On sentiment: Expresses (perhaps uncharacteristically) that when the four of them have it together, there's no one else he'd rather play with

GEORGE: I think your beard suits you. Man. 

RINGO: [approving] Mm. [Paul laughs]

PAUL: Well, you know, I’m—

RINGO: Captain. [laughter] 

PAUL: Yeah. [laughs] But you know me about it, I’m just sort of, I don’t know about it, you know. It’s always – with anything, I’m—

RINGO: It’s great for the film. 

GEORGE: You just keep on until you do know about it.

N/A

### Beat 5

JOHN & PAUL: Wake up in the morning I don’t feel blue / ’Cause I know I got you / Get a funny feeling all day and night / Get the funny feeling you don’t treat me right / Should have read your letter / And then I’d know / Would have felt much better / Because I know you love me so.

### Beat 6

PAUL: I never sort of knew what it was about before. I mean, so, she’s on a train—

JOHN: Yeah.

PAUL: And he sort of—

JOHN: And he goes to the station, and misses it.

PAUL: [laughs] But he goes back and finds that it was the wrong number. So—

GEORGE: “Wrong location.”

JOHN: [officious voice] To rhyme with station, you know.

PAUL: [laughs] That’s great, that. “The rail man said, ‘You’ve got the wrong location.’” “Well…” Great. [pause] Our kid’s been saying, “You should do that,” for years, you know, and we’ve always sort of, “Yeah, well, you know, Mike, you don’t understand about these things…”

### Beat 7

PAUL: I’ll wait until tomorrow / Till you come my way / That’s why I sit here / Alone and I pray…

JOHN & PAUL: But I’ll wait till tomorrow / Through a thousand setting suns / I’ll wait till tomorrow / If tomorrow ever comes…

### Beat 8

JOHN & PAUL: Won’t you please say goodbye / This love has long since gone cold / Won’t you please say goodbye / How many times must you be told…

### Beat 9

GEORGE: That band – uh, that band Bonnie & Delaney, for Apple, are more together than we’ve ever been. You know, as a band.

JOHN: Yeah.

GEORGE: [inaudible] You know, everyone’s who has ever been to see them playing, and sounding, their lives change. It’s really exciting when you hear a real groove on—

JOHN: You see, I think when we’ve done a month of this and that, and we do an album, that somehow we should either use what we’ve – the togetherness, to do the album. You know.

GEORGE: Yeah, to do a new one.

PAUL: Yeah?

JOHN: Yeah. But you know what I mean. We – we’re – we don’t fit. We’ve sort of run out of touch with it. If we get into the swinging of playing, let’s do an album after this album. You know, about a month later. That is, if we all— [inaudible]

PAUL: But I mean, you know—

JOHN: I mean, if we spend two – a month on this—

PAUL: We are.

JOHN: —just get to a good peak playing, and then we split.

PAUL: No, well, we should – we should sort of organise our career, man.

GEORGE: Yeah.

PAUL: Get our career together. And this, you know, this is like the idea of this. It’s to get us so we quite enjoy this. Of doing it again. And then what would we like to do next? Well, I would like— [inaudible] —to do a live show, lads?

GEORGE: Yeah. I think – I think when we learn to, like [inaudible] then we’d dig it. And we know ‘em all, what – you know, if somebody could say “that one” [and we could play them] when we were asked, that’d be great.
PAUL: Well, we can do it, but— [inaudible]

GEORGE: It’s just that choice. It’s like hard work, really, to do it. And uh, it’s – you know, it’s a drag to try and, you know – ‘cause I want to remember all the words—
PAUL: Right.

GEORGE: —and really, really get ‘em the way I want it to get ‘em, and to get the guitar, [and not keep being] made to perform when I don’t want to play the guitar. And then you’ve got to play the guitar… when you’re not ready for it. But that… that’s alright.

PAUL: I don’t know, you know, I mean—

GEORGE: I mean, we’ve got to do that in order to get the good bit.

PAUL: Right, yeah.

GEORGE: We’ve got to get through that bit of shit of the meeting until we get it together again.

PAUL: [receptive] You know, I can see it just – so we’re just working.

GEORGE: But – and also there’s so much to get out, you know…

PAUL: Yeah, right.

GEORGE: [sincere] And there’s nobody better to get it out with than us. For me, anyway, really. In my heart of hearts.

PAUL: [long pause; reserved] Yeah.

GEORGE: It should be where – you know, if you write a song, I feel as though I’ve wrote it. And mine versus – vice versa. You know, I mean – or to be involved, really, as much, as if… That was the good thing about the last album, [because] it’s the only album so far I’ve tried to get involved with.

PAUL: Yeah.

GEORGE: [inaudible]

PAUL: Mm.

GEORGE: The last one.

Beat 9: Amidst a discussion of what the Beatles should play for their projected live show to culminate the (Get Back/Let It Be) sessions  and the general concern of playing live again, John suggests they ride on the momentum that will be built from these sessions/song rehearsals and go directly into making a new album right after (instead of falling into their previous pattern of having long breaks in between recording sessions, which has affected their band chemistry and allowed them to become complacent). Whether John is intentionally implying the breakup of the Beatles as an eventuality or merely using an innocent turn of phrase is unclear, but it prompts both Paul and George to relays their optimism about the band’s future prospects as long as they remain focused.

George stresses the importance of rehearsing together until they have every number down by heart so that the band can go onstage again without insecurities and utterly assured of themselves and one another. He admits that the pain and tedium of the process has in the past frustrated his resolve in his own compositions and discouraged his level of involvement in the band (i.e. the others’ songs), but acknowledges that it is a necessary course to take and that they would not get anywhere without putting in raw hours of conscientious effort.

In this frame of mind, George contends that the Beatles could realign themselves once again as a band more than the sum of their parts if everyone approached every song as if it were their own with the same amount of care and creativity, and in a moment of (perhaps uncharacteristic) sentiment expresses that when the four of them have it together, there’s no one else he’d rather play with.
