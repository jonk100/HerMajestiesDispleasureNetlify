## Day 5 Overview (January 8, 1969)

Fifth day of "Get Back" sessions at Twickenham Film Studios. The Beatles returned to Twickenham the following day (January 9).

### Overall Atmosphere

**Improved mood:**
- Despite previous day's tensions, group appeared in better spirits during morning session
- Focusing on rehearsing songs from previous days with noticeable enthusiasm
- Solid performances of "Two Of Us," "One After 909," "Don't Let Me Down," "I've Got A Feeling"

**Day's highlights:**
- George introduced "I Me Mine" (written previous night)
- Extensive rehearsals after lunch
- Only day in January 1969 group actively worked on it (interest waned in following days)
- Beatles became quite animated in excitement about developing "I Me Mine" for show
- Displayed camaraderie unlike what most assume dominated entire Let It Be project

**Paul's contributions:**
- Led further rehearsals of "Maxwell's Silver Hammer" and "She Came In Through The Bathroom Window"
- First group rehearsal of "The Long and Winding Road"
- Introduced "Let It Be" to full band

**John's contributions:**
- Had yet to contribute new songs to sessions
- Offered only unfinished "Mean Mr. Mustard" (demoed May 1968)
- Not yet serious contender for project

**Cover versions and jams:**
- Largely inconsequential, brief renditions played between structured rehearsals
- Two early Lennon-McCartney compositions: "Too Bad About Sorrows," "Just Fun" (each lasting only few seconds)
- **Notable:** John's remark "Queen says no to pot-smoking FBI members" recorded at end of "Too Bad About Sorrows" - later included on Let It Be album prior to "For You Blue" (only recorded audio piece from Twickenham to appear on official release)

**End of session:**
- Long discussion about potential locations for live performance
- Michael Lindsay-Hogg and Denis O'Dell pushed for outdoor amphitheater in Sabratha, Libya
- Another proposal: performing aboard ocean liner
- John: enthusiastic about travel plans
- Paul: open to idea
- George: strongly opposed (impractical and costly)
- Ringo: more flexible, though not entirely convinced
- Decision: agreed to sleep on it before moving forward

**Introduction:** Start of day, before John arrived
- George introduced to Paul, Ringo, and Michael Lindsay-Hogg
- Playing on guitar and singing vocals
- Explained he'd written it previous night

**Grammar discussion:**

**George:** "Is that grammatical? 'Flowing more freely than wine.'"

**Michael Lindsay-Hogg:** "Yeah"

**George:** "'Flowing much freer'?"

**Michael Lindsay-Hogg:** "More freely"

**Paul:** "'Freely'. 'Freer'"

**George:** "It's funny when… If you're writing, yeah, thinking of how you say it"

**Paul:** "'Freer'. For it's sticky out here" [laughter]

**Afternoon rehearsals:**
- George worked up nerve to suggest band-mates learn new composition
- "Would you like to learn a new one? Very simple" (to John who wasn't present for first introduction)

**John's reaction:**
- After getting acclimated, clowned around on guitar during couple run-throughs
- Asserted disapproval of waltz beat
- Mockingly suggested he play barrel organ on song

**Arrangement discussions:**
- Paul owned accordion, made serious suggestion: "Want the accordion?"
- George considered but instrument wasn't at Twickenham: "If it's not here, then just f*ck it"
- George voiced idea for stand-up acoustic bass (never came to fruition)

**John's impatience and loss of interest:**
- "Are you going to teach us this?"
- George complied by teaching Paul and John the chords
- John lost interest, decided to dance waltz with Yoko while remaining Beatles rehearsed extensively

**George's amusement:**
- Instead of taking offense, George amused by their dance routine
- Suggested this be John's contribution for upcoming performance
- What Lennon could contribute instrumentally wouldn't really be needed anyway

**Dance routine proposal:**

**George to John:** "Do you want to do that on the show? That'd be great, 'cause it's so simple to do, the tune. But to do that waltz, or something, if you want to bag it up a bit"

**Paul (amused, imitating MC):** "John and Yoko would like to waltz in their white bag!"

**Paul (own voice):** "And there's a white bag dancing around"

**Paul (MC voice):** "They were doing things inside it!"

**Paul:** "We should do it as an escapologist thing, and we put the bag over them"

**Paul (MC voice):** "You can see their not tied at all! There's nothing up their sleeves!"

**Note:** John and Yoko began "Bagism" events two-and-a-half months later (March 31, 1969) during Vienna visit to promote film "Rape"

**Beatles' enthusiasm:**
- From this point on, became quite animated in excitement about developing "I Me Mine" for show

**Dance instructions:**
- John and Yoko's dance routine seriously considered as part of arrangement
- Waltzing rehearsals continuing to point of Paul and George giving pair dance instructions
- Paul's comment: "You'll spoil the spontaneity of the dance when you actually have to do it"

**Subsequent history:**
- Beatles did not revisit song for remainder of Get Back sessions
- Later in 1969: Michael Lindsay-Hogg decided to include in film, along with John/Yoko waltzing segment
- Decision prompted Beatles (minus John Lennon) to formally record song January 1970

#### Conversation 2: End of Day - Libya/Boat Trip Discussion (Extensive)

**Paul McCartney:** "An outdoor scene has to be in England because…"

**Denis O'Dell:** "I don't think it's practical to do it in England. It's too bloody cold"

**Michael Lindsay-Hogg:** "Yes, that was one of the reasons we started veering off on these ideas was when we were looking at locations that Friday after Christmas"

**Paul McCartney:** "We are in a film studio. We're going to build something so that… We shouldn't just try and build something like the Tower Ballroom, 'cause we could go to the Tower Ballroom"

**Michael Lindsay-Hogg:** "But, once you get on a stage, you are performers and you gotta have someone to do it to. Either the camera or real people, I think"

**Paul McCartney:** "Yeah, we haven't… Any number we've done at the moment, if we've noticed the camera on us, we've tried to ignore it"

**Michael Lindsay-Hogg:** "But you've either got to be performing directly to the people at home or to an audience"

**Paul McCartney:** "See that's why I thought like a ballroom. If we did go right back. Like, 'Come to the Tower Ballroom. There's a dance on.' You know? Oh, incidentally, we'll be the band there. And then we go on and we play all the numbers"

**Michael Lindsay-Hogg:** "But you're just not the local dance band. I don't think it's quite enough scope"

**Glyn Johns:** "I also think that people are very interested in seeing how an audience would react"

**Michael Lindsay-Hogg:** "Because the audience is so much part of the first half of you, musically"

**Paul McCartney:** "Okay, so we're all prepared to do it with an audience. But you can't just have the same old audience"

**Denis O'Dell:** "What can you do that's new with them?"

**George Harrison:** "If we can just think of an image, how we'd like to be, which could be like a nightclub act. Just the smoochy low lights and about ten people"

**Michael Lindsay-Hogg:** "What's the point, when you could be giving people happiness with a full house? Whatever kind of full house we decided. I mean, we have to think about the audience. It really ought to be the whole world"

**Denis O'Dell:** "That's where… Now we're going right… the whole circle back to Sabratha"

**Michael Lindsay-Hogg:** "It is a location which is marvelous in itself, by the sea"

**Denis O'Dell:** "What he's saying is right. It's the background"

**Michael Lindsay-Hogg:** "I don't think anything is gonna beat a perfect acoustic place by the water, out of doors"

**Ringo Starr:** "For a rock and roll group?"

**Denis O'Dell:** "I really think we ought to go over and set it up upfront. Shoot a day sequence, a night sequence, a torchlight sequence out there with sea, desert, four days. Make it comfortable for everybody"

**Michael Lindsay-Hogg:** "Yes, I think we're gonna do rock and roll at dawn or at night. I'm sure we can do rock and roll there if we get the right audience"

(chattering)

**Michael Lindsay-Hogg:** (talking to John Lennon joining conversation) "Come on. We're going to Africa. We're off"

**Paul McCartney:** "No, we're not. Not necessarily"

**John Lennon:** "Yeah! Let's go! Let's go!"

**George Harrison:** "Where to?"

**Denis O'Dell:** "To Sabratha… Tripoli! Fantastic sound!"

**Ringo Starr:** "You're thinking of yourself, 'cause you wanna be nice and warm and cosy!"

**George Harrison:** "What is the point of doing it abroad? I'd much rather do it, and then go away"

**John Lennon:** "See, it's like having the most fantastic set on Earth, but we haven't made a set, you know?"

**Ringo Starr:** "How many are gonna be looking at the set besides us and him?"

**John Lennon:** "Every time we've done an album, we've said, 'Why are we stuck in EMI?' We could be doing it in LA. We could be in France. And every time we do it, and here we are again, building another bloody castle around us"

**Paul McCartney:** "Well said, John. Well said!"

**John Lennon:** "And this time we do it there. I'd be thrilled to do it. Just timing it so as the sun came up just on the middle eight"

**Michael Lindsay-Hogg:** "One of Russia's points was that he wanted an English audience"

**John Lennon:** "Oh Russia? That's be great!"

**Michael Trommsdorff:** "No, no, no that's Ringo's code name. He's Russia"

**John Lennon:** "Just give me one reason to stay there?"

**Ringo Starr:** "For the people!"

**John Lennon:** "People? That's the only reason. Alright, so we'll take 'em with us"

**Paul McCartney:** "Look, we were gonna give tickets away at this door here. We'd given out those tickets, but they include a boat ride as well"

**Michael Lindsay-Hogg:** "We take them with us, and that's the show"

**Paul McCartney:** "Okay, yeah. We're doing a live show. And we're doing it in Arabia. And it's like… Whoever has been waiting to see the lads rocking again"

**George Harrison:** "It's just impractical to try and get all those… Lug all them people there and try and get all that equipment"

**Paul McCartney:** "But then if it was their problem…"

**Denis O'Dell:** "But if you say, 'That's what I want,' that's what has to happen"

**John Lennon:** "That's not our problem"

**George Harrison:** "Of course it's our problem"

**Paul McCartney:** "Tell you what I'll offer you. If we're going away and we hire a boat to take the audience with you. We'll do a bloody show on a boat"

**Michael Lindsay-Hogg:** "Wait here's France coming in here now"

**George Harrison:** "France? I can't go to France!"

**Michael Lindsay-Hogg:** "No no, no. That's your code name"

**Paul McCartney:** "No, he smoked some garlic once" (laughing)

**Paul McCartney:** "So, like, I'll come in with you, as long as you can get a couple of boats"

**George Harrison:** "And then we're stuck with a bloody big boatload of people for two weeks. At least you can go home from here. You can get away from it all"

**Denis O'Dell:** "It'll take three days trip on the boat"

**George Harrison:** "I think the idea of the boat is completely insane. It's very expensive and insane, and…"

**Denis O'Dell:** "I think it should be the least of our worries. Money. I really do"

**George Harrison:** "And who's gonna cough up for that though?"

**John Lennon:** "If P&O will do a deal with Storm, they'll do one with us"

**George Harrison:** "They haven't even made back the money it cost to buy the film for Magical Mystery Tour"

**John Lennon:** "We should be able to get the boat for the publicity they get from it"

**George Harrison:** "They won't even give us a free Fender amp!"

**Ringo Starr:** "I've stopped being Russia now"

**Denis O'Dell:** "It's gonna be great. You'd love the place"

**Ringo Starr:** "I've moved to Yugoslavia!" [chuckles]

**George Harrison:** "I may love the place, but I'd rather do the show, then go and love the place"

**Ringo Starr:** "How're you gonna get a ship in a couple of days?"

**John Lennon:** "We got the American Navy for 'How I Won The War'"

**Ringo Starr:** "I was there. Yes, I know. But they were passing by and you only used them for a few hours. I've seen it, John. I went to the premiere"

**John Lennon:** "Did you enjoy it?"

**Ringo Starr:** "I thought you were great"

**John Lennon:** "Thanks a lot, Ringo" (laughing)

**Michael Lindsay-Hogg:** "How are we stacking? If there's no problem with the equipment, and with the right audience, which will be basically English-speaking brought from here"

**John Lennon:** "Broad-minded Englishmen wanted!"

**Ringo Starr:** "Still not the same"

**Michael Lindsay-Hogg:** "If you'll say yes, and if we get it together, then will you go?"

**John Lennon:** "Well, if we mull it over tonight. Leave it in the air and that, just think about it"

**Michael Lindsay-Hogg:** "Well, I feel, as the trade says, 'The vibes are very good at the moment'"

**John Lennon:** "But we can all say yes now and somebody can decide no tomorrow. It's not gonna make any odds"

**Ringo Starr:** "Good night, everybody!"

**Michael Lindsay-Hogg:** "Good night, Russia"

**Ringo Starr:** "That's a wrap"

**Denis O'Dell:** "I'll see you in Sabratha!"
