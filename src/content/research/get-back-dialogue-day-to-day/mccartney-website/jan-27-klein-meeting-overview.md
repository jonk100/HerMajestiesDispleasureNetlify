### Derek Taylor on Klein

**Ken McNab 'And in the End' (2020):**
"Klein is essential in the Great Novel as the Demon King. Just as you think everything's going to be all right, here he is. I helped to bring him to Apple, but I did give The Beatles certain solemn warnings"

**Peter Doggett 'You Never Give Me Your Money' (2010):**
"I brought him to Apple, but I did give the Beatles certain solemn warnings. I told them to ask around, and said that he had various reputations, that he might get them a good financial deal, but might not be someone you would want to take home to your mother"

### Allen Klein's Motivation

**Keith Badman 'Off the Record' (2008):**
"I went straight to Lennon when he said they were going broke. I wanted to find out first if he realised the position he was in.

### Klein's Account of Meeting

**Ken McNab 'And in the End' (2020):**
"I didn't propose anything, I don't work that way. I just asked him 'How can I help you?' That's all, and after we broke the ice, it was a very personal sort of meeting. We were trying to get to know each other. He was scared to death about the money situation. How would you feel, sitting there damn near broke after having made millions and millions of pounds and about to end up with nothing except memories?"

**Stan Soocher 'Baby You're a Rich Man' (2015):**
"At the Dorchester meeting, Lennon said to Klein, 'Look, the Eastmans are the exclusive representative of the Beatles. So we can't talk about that. Would you be willing to represent Yoko and me?' 'I was really trying to remain — not appear very anxious;' Klein recalled, 'and I said, "Well, I think we should sleep on it tonight." And he said, "What's the matter, don't you want it now?"'

Klein claimed the eager Lennon phoned him a few hours later to seal a management deal with the Beatles. 'And I was sleeping. I got up,' Klein said. 'And that's how it began.' Lennon noted later, however, 'It was plain to me that Klein came to London expressly to offer his management services to the Beatles'"

### John Lennon on Klein

**McCabe/Schonfeld 'Apple to the Core' (1972):**
"[Allen Klein] knew all about us and our music. I knew right away he was the man for us. I wrote to Sir Joseph Lockwood that night, I said 'Dear Sir Joe: From now on Allen Klein handles all my stuff'"

### John's Conversation with George (January 28 Session)

**John Lennon:** "Yeah. And it's… You know, it's very interesting. You know, from a lot of angles. And the– But I want to tell you all at once, you know, so as it's not… But just, um… I just think he's fantastic"

**George Harrison:** "Really?"

**John Lennon:** "Yeah. A lot of interesting news that we don't know half about, just about…"

**George Harrison:** "About us?"

**John Lennon:** "Well, I'll tell– You know, he'll tell you all that, 'cause it's… You know, he knows everything about everything. Very interesting guy. I was there till 2:00 in the morning"

**George Harrison:** "Oh, you went last night?"

**John Lennon:** "I went there thinking, 'Well, I've got to see him. I put it off last time.' You know? I keep hearing about him all these years. Things that you just… you can't believe, you know. Right down to where… where it's gone, and how to get it. So, I, you know… Well, I didn't really wanna say it to sort of half o'ya. I thought, 'He's gonna look after me, whatever.' That's… it's just like that. And he knows… He even knows what we're like, you know? The way he described each one of us, you know, and what we've done, and what we're gonna do and that. But just, like, he knows me as much as you do. Incredible guy. And he's got a great idea for Biafra. He's like – He says, 'I'm a practical man.' And his thing… You know The Stones' Circus we did? So he arranges those things for them"

**George Harrison:** "Yeah"

**John Lennon:** "All we heard about that and the royalty from way back… They get much more than us. However many we sell, they cop. You know, so, The Stones show, he's gonna make an LP out of it. They're making a book of it and everything, of course, you know? Like, everybody is into that. And he's gonna, uh, make an LP of it, of everybody that was on… to buy food for Biafra. Yeah, I was telling him about your idea for that film"

**George Harrison:** "Oh, yeah"

**John Lennon:** "The thing is, I mean, if we took the food to that place, with the money we've all earned… He'd do it completely himself, arrange it all. I didn't mean to get into all this, but he's so fascinating"

### Extended John Quote (Beatles Get Back book, 2021)

**John talking to George Harrison on January 28:**

"I went there thinking, 'Oh fucking hell, well, I've got to see him. I put it off last time.' But I was sort of half-thinking all that time, you know, 'I keep hearing about him all these years, you know. So what? So, somebody says he's this or that, you know…' But he… fuckin' hell, he knows about Isherwood [Beatles accountant], Bahamas [base of some Beatles finances], Strach [Beatles accountant]… Things that you can't believe, you know. The same old news, but right down to where: where it's gone, and how to get it. So I didn't really want to say it. I said, 'He's going to look after me whatever,' you know. It's just like that. And he knows, he even knowns what we're like, you know, just from the pick-up. I mean, he said he had to see me to know exactly if he was right or not. But the way he described each one of us, you know, and what we'd done and what we're going to do, and that… but just like, you know, I know you, he knows me as much as you do. Incredible guy. We [John and Yoko] were both just stunned. And it was just like, he's one of those guys when he was talking…"

### Allen Klein's 1971 Affidavit

**Context:** February 1971, during hearing of Paul's lawsuit to dissolve Beatles' contractual partnership, Allen Klein declared following about January 27 meeting.

**Full statement:**

"In December 1968 [?], I read in the press a statement, attributed to John Lennon, to the effect that if The Beatles continued to spend money at the rate at which they were doing 'they would be broke in 6 months'. The following month (January 1969) I telephoned Mr. Lennon from the United States and arranged to meet him in London. This meeting took place at the Dorchester Hotel on 27th January 1969. At that time The Beatles and their company, Apple Corps Limited ('Apple') had issued a general retainer to one John Eastman to negotiate contracts for them throughout the world. Although that retainer was terminable at any time, Mr. Lennon told me that this was the arrangement and he only asked me at this stage to look after the personal affairs of himself and his wife.

Since I was to look after Mr. Lennon's affairs one matter of immediate urgency was the proposed acquisition by Apple, then under consideration, of Nemperor Holdings Limited, previously called NEMS Enterprises Limited ('NEMS'). I arranged to meet the other three Beatles with Mr. Lennon the following evening. NEMS was the company owned as to 90% by the estate of Brian Epstein (The Beatles' former Manager) or his family interests, while each of The Beatles individually owned a 21/2% interest. NEMS had acted as the management company for The Beatles from 1962 to about 1967. It and its associated companies held continuing interests in perpetuity in contracts entered into by The Beatles and in the products of their services throughout this period. Some of these rights were of great continuing value, notwithstanding that the management agreement had come to an end. In particular there was a recording agreement dated 26th January 1967 between The Beatles and Electrical & Musical Industries Limited ('EMI') which did not expire until 1967 and in which NEMS had a 25% interest. At my first meeting with Mr. Lennon mentioned above, he told me that John Eastman had proposed to The Beatles that they should purchase the Epstein interests in NEMS and that the deal was about to be put through finance having been arranged through EMI by means of an advance of £ 1 million against future royalties"

### Outcome

**Immediate:** John chose Klein as personal manager that night, wrote to EMI Chairman

**Following day (January 28):** Klein met with other Beatles

**Long-term impact:** Klein vs. Eastmans conflict became major factor in Beatles' eventual breakup
