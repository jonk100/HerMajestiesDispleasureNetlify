## Day 13 Overview (January 22, 1969)

Thirteenth day of "Get Back" sessions - **second day at Apple Studios, pivotal due to Billy Preston's arrival.** Beatles returned to Apple Studio the following day (January 23).

### Overall Atmosphere

**Pivotal day:** Billy Preston's arrival after lunch profoundly influenced tone of remaining sessions

**Billy Preston background:**
- First met Beatles in Hamburg in early 1960s
- In London for concert and TV appearances with Ray Charles
- George Harrison encountered him and invited him to Beatles sessions

**Preston's impact:**
- Joined after lunch, contributing electric piano and keyboards
- Playing immediately enhanced sound of sessions
- Project adhered to strict "no overdubs" rule (Preston's presence fulfilled this need)
- Had energizing effect on group, encouraging renewed focus and enthusiasm
- Earlier tensions of Twickenham sessions seemed distant memory

**Day's focus:**
- Concentrated efforts on three songs: "Don't Let Me Down," "I've Got A Feeling," "Dig A Pony"
- Repeated rehearsals, recordings, and playbacks formed core of day's work
- Preston quickly adapted to material, inspiring band to push themselves creatively

**Cover songs:**
- Dabbled far less than previous sessions, showing greater focus on recording new songs
- Attempts included Fats Domino's "I'm Ready" (also known as "Rocker") and "Save The Last Dance For Me"
- Both included by Glyn Johns in multiple iterations of his "Get Back" album

**Project evolution:**
- Improved working environment at Apple Studio combined with Preston's contributions reinvigorated Beatles
- Live performance idea remained alive
- Discussions of potential venues such as London's Primrose Hill
- Band rediscovering creative synergy, leaving discord of earlier sessions behind

### Billy Preston Firsthand Accounts

**Billy Preston:**
"When I got there, they were filming Let It Be and recording and all. We started reminiscing and playing old rock'n'roll songs. They said: 'Sit in. You want to stay and help us finish the album? Take a solo…' They just made me a member of the band"

"I was on tour with Ray Charles and we were in London. George was at the concert and thought: 'Hey, that looks like Billy Preston.' So he called around and found out that it was me. He called me at the hotel and invited me over to see the guys. Before I got there, Mal Evans had told me that they had been going through a lot of depression, and that he was glad that I came around because it gave them a lot of life. It made them happy a little bit"

**George Harrison (Beatles Anthology 2000):**
"Billy came down and I said, 'Remember Billy? Here he is – he can play the piano'. He got on the electric piano, and straight away there was 100% improvement in the vibe in the room. Having this fifth person was just enough to cut the ice that we'd created among ourselves. Billy didn't know all the politics and the games that had been going on, so in his innocence he got stuck in and gave an extra little kick to the band. Everybody was happier to have somebody else playing and it made what we were doing more enjoyable. We all played better and that was a great session. It was more or less just as it is on the record"

**George Harrison (Keith Badman 'Off the Record' 2008):**
"It was still very strained, the atmosphere, and then Billy Preston walked into the office. I just grabbed him and brought him down to the studio, and said, 'How would you like to play piano?' And it put everything more at ease, because, having a fifth person there, it sort of off-set the vibes"

**George Harrison (Recording the Beatles 2006):**
"I pulled in Billy Preston. It helped because the others would have to control themselves a bit more. John and Paul mainly, because they had to, you know, act more handsomely. It's interesting to see how people behave nicely when you bring a guest in because they don't want everyone to know that they're so bitchy"

**George Harrison (Classic Rock May 2020):**
"It's interesting to see how people behave nicely when you bring a guest in, because they don't really want everybody to know they're so bitchy… Suddenly everybody's on their best behaviour"

**Ken Mansfield (US manager at Apple Records):**
"Billy was really special to the band at that time. I think George was very wise for bringing him in, because Billy was a calming effect. They were all really big fans of Billy. He was really important to the whole thing. When they were in the studio, they would play something and Billy would look over at me with his eyes just as big as saucers and go: 'Wow, did you hear that?' And they'd turn to Billy and say: 'Hey, why don't you do this here?' and Billy would go: 'Wow, that's great'"

**Paul McCartney (Beatles Anthology 2000):**
"Billy was brilliant – a little young whizz-kid. We'd always got on very well with him. He showed up in London and we all said, 'Oh Bill! Great – let's have him play on a few things.' So he started sitting in on the sessions, because he was an old mate really.

It might have helped us all behave better with one another on the sessions. I think it also created problems, because as The Beatles we'd always just been four people in the band. We were very much a unit — the Four-Headed Monster, I've heard us referred to.

So when Billy came in, I think that though we did have to behave ourselves a bit – because it was like having a guest in the house, someone you put your best manners on for – there was a slight worry in the background also that maybe he was joining the group. That kind of thing was happening. So we couldn't tell whether it was a crack in the whole thing, or whether it was going to be good. It was a little bit puzzling.

But he played great and we all had a great time, so it worked out fine in the end"

### Chronological Conversations

#### Conversation 1: Paul on Mary Hopkin's Album

**Context:** Paul produced Mary Hopkin's first album "Post Card" at end of 1968. Release scheduled month after this session.

**Paul McCartney:** "Neil thinks they'll want to print their own in America. It's like… I don't like that thing where it goes cheap when it goes to America – and they do the reprint. Because the album's gonna be called Postcard. By Mary Hopkin. So we're just getting Valentine's, the people who make postcards, to put one of them on the cover of the LP. There's no, sort of, sleeve notes… And just a few pictures of her in it all"

#### Conversation 2: Billy Preston Joins - Introduction

**Context:** Billy joined session after lunch, promptly persuaded by John to join band for project. George proposed playing numbers they had so far for Billy to learn.

**John Lennon:** "Every number's got a piano part. And normally we overdub it. But this time we wanna do it live"

**Billy Preston:** "Yeah. That'd be nice"

**John Lennon:** "I mean, just live to ourselves… Straight off, one number after the other. And that means having somebody in on it"

**George Harrison:** "If you'd like to do that you're welcome"

**Billy Preston:** "Sure. Beautiful"

**John Lennon:** "Right. And then you'd be on the album"

**Billy Preston:** "You're kidding"

**John Lennon:** "Well, that's good then. We've taped a few. The thing is to get some tapes made of what we've done, and let him have a listen, take 'em home at night"

**George Harrison:** "He'll probably pick them up much quicker hearing us play 'em"

**Paul McCartney:** "Yeah, just rehearsing them"

**John Lennon:** "Have you met Billy, George?"

**George Martin:** "How do you do, Billy?"

**John Lennon:** "That's George Martin, our A&R man. That's Billy. We played with him in Hamburg. He was backing Little Richard"

**Paul McCartney:** "In the old days"

#### Conversation 3: Film Concept Evolution - Third Beatles Movie

**Context:** Goal of sessions evolved. Idea of making commercial film from sessions emerged - would become 3rd Beatles movie. Film would culminate in live event. Primrose Hill (grassy hill with spectacular views across London) considered.

**Michael Lindsay-Hogg:** "I had a word with Neil. What he indicates is that we'll do something early next week"

**John Lennon:** "And it'll be great. Soon as we got them off… We almost know three numbers, actually. I mean, we'll get it. And the thing is we've got Billy now"

**Michael Lindsay-Hogg:** "Is he going to stay with you?"

**John Lennon:** "Yeah, well sure. He's the guy. And that solves a lot. Paul was saying we do the whole show once here, and then maybe go up Primrose Hill, or something"

**Michael Lindsay-Hogg:** "I think do it here and then, like, take a week…"

**John Lennon:** "Or we could do half of the LP here and the other half outside. It will be fantastic with this whole build up with bits of paper, and Twickenham, and all that scene. And it will be a movie, you know, not a TV show. It will be the third Beatles movie"

**Michael Lindsay-Hogg:** "If it's good enough, yeah"

**John Lennon:** "It's good enough now"

#### Conversation 4: Primrose Hill Planning

**Michael Lindsay-Hogg:** "Paul, what I'd like to do now is go and talk to Neil about seeing if Primrose Hill is free. Can I do that?"

**Paul McCartney:** "It would be nice almost not to tell 'em"

**Michael Lindsay-Hogg:** "Exactly. That's why I wanted to do it in Africa. Because you just start playing, and one by one they come, one by one, ten by ten…"

**Unknown:** "Well, to me that's okay. Primrose Hill. And I dig it"

**Paul McCartney:** "And then if it lasts for two days, that will be really good because we'll all be forced into a time thing and we won't have another go at it"

**Michael Lindsay-Hogg:** "Right, I agree. I think the second day, in fact, will be the one that will make it"

**Paul McCartney:** "And I bet that would just, sort of, magically then give us the show"

**Michael Lindsay-Hogg:** "So, but just roughly, timewise, you'd say in about a week?"

**Paul McCartney:** "Yeah"

#### Conversation 5: Allen Klein Meeting Scheduled

**Context:** Peter Brown (managing director of Apple Corps) approached John to arrange meeting with controversial American businessman Allen Klein. John requested meeting be scheduled for Monday the 27th.

**Peter Brown:** "I've spoken with Mr. Klein. He's coming in Friday. So I don't think he'll be here until the end of the day. So, about six o'clock on Friday"

**John Lennon:** "I think… Weren't we doing something on Friday night?"

**Yoko Ono:** "Friday night, yes"

**John Lennon:** "He's not coming for a day, is he? Can I see him on Monday night?"
