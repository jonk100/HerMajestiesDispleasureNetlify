## January 17-19, 1969: Apple Studio Installation

Emergency installation of EMI equipment at Apple Studios, 3 Savile Row, London, following discovery that Magic Alex's studio was completely inadequate.

### Context

**January 10:** George Harrison walked out of Get Back sessions at Twickenham

**January 12:** Meeting between four Beatles failed to resolve issues

**January 15:** Four Beatles met again
- George agreed to rejoin group
- **Condition:** Rehearsals relocated from Twickenham to Apple's basement studio (under construction by Magic Alex)

**January 16:** 
- Twickenham set dismantled, equipment relocated to 3 Savile Row
- George Harrison and Glyn Johns inspected Magic Alex's basement studio
- **Discovery:** Facilities severely inadequate with significant distortion and hiss
- Studio unfit for Beatles' needs
- Glyn Johns contacted George Martin for assistance
- EMI agreed to provide necessary equipment

### Magic Alex Studio Disaster

**Alexis "Magic Alex" Mardas background:**
- Hired by Beatles (championed by John and George)
- Had often said Abbey Road studio was "no good" (to George Martin's annoyance)
- Boasted he could build much better studio with 72-track tape machine (vs. 4-track at Abbey Road being updated to 8-track)
- Given job of designing new Apple Studio in basement of Apple headquarters

**Outrageous plans:**
- Replace acoustic baffles around Ringo's drums with invisible sonic force field
- Bought "huge" surplus computers from British Aerospace (stored in barn, never left, later sold as scrap metal)

**January 1969 reality when Beatles required studio:**
- **No 72-track tape deck** (Mardas had reduced it to 16 tracks)
- **No soundproofing**
- **No talkback (intercom) system**
- **No patch bay** to run wiring between control room and 16 speakers
- Speakers (16 of them embedded in walls) sounded atrocious
- **No wiring conduits** between control room and studio (thick, bulky mic cables had to be run under door and down corridor)

**Only new equipment:** Crude mixing console Mardas had built

### Mixing Console Disaster

**Dave Harries (recording engineer) description:**
"The mixing console [made by Mardas] was made of bit of wood and an old oscilloscope. It looked like the control panel of a B-52 bomber. They actually tried a session on this desk, they did a take, but when they played back the tape it was all hum and hiss. Terrible. The Beatles walked out, that was the end of it"

**Alan Parsons (tape operator) description:**
"The metal was an eighth of an inch out around the knobs and switches. It had obviously been done with a hammer and chisel instead of being properly designed and machined. It did pass signals but Glyn Johns said 'I can't do anything with this. I can't make a record with this board'"

**Geoff Emerick:**
"The mixing console was sold as scrap to a secondhand electronics shop in the Edgware Road for £5. It wasn't worth any more"

"The mixing console barely worked at all, and what signal it did pass was distorted. Little surprise, given that it was essentially just a sheet of plywood with sixteen faders and an oscilloscope stuck in the middle, which acted as an inefficient level meter"

"I often wondered why [The Beatles] were so fond of Alex; nobody else found him all that likable, and most people around the Beatles saw right through him. The mixing console he had constructed for them had been put in storage while I was doing the Abbey Road sessions. In the end I sold it to a secondhand shop in Edgeware Road for the staggering sum of five pounds — probably twice what it was worth"

**Console scrapped:** After just one session

### Firsthand Accounts

**George Harrison:**
"Alex's recording studio at Apple was the biggest disaster of all time. He didn't have a clue what he was doing"

"It was 'chaos', and they had to 'rip it all out and start again,' calling it 'the biggest disaster of all time'"

**George Harrison's suspicions raised:**
- Saw Mardas wandering around in white coat with clipboard
- Considered possibility Mardas had "just read the latest version of Science Weekly, and used its ideas"

**Barry Miles (Manager of Zapple Records):**
"'Magic' Alex must have been a considerable drain on resources. I never had any faith in Alex. It was John and George who championed him. He was going to invent all these incredible things, like a door that could tell friend from foe, and would only let in people with good vibes"

**Geoff Emerick (2006 memoir):**
"Alex had been mumbling excuses and overrunning his budget for months on end, but once he was put on notice that the Beatles would be starting sessions in the Apple studio in a matter of weeks, he went into overdrive. It didn't matter: no amount of motivation and hard work could make up for the fact that Alex basically did not know what he was doing. The studio he built for them was a complete and utter disaster"

"After a day of fruitless recording tests, George Martin ordered in EMI's mobile console, which came accompanied by newly hired assistant engineer Alan Parsons. For the next few weeks, he, George, and Glyn labored over what John Lennon was to later call 'the shittiest load of badly recorded shit with a lousy feeling to it ever'"

**George Martin:**
"The trouble was that Alex was always coming to the studios to see what we were doing and to learn from it, while at the same time saying 'These people are so out of date.' But I found it very difficult to chuck him out, because the boys liked him so much. Since it was very obvious that I didn't, a minor schism developed"

**Mardas' later claim:**
- Stated he had never been in basement of Savile Row
- Said studio equipment he was building was being tested in Apple Electronics at Boston Place, Marylebone

### EMI Equipment Installation

**Dates:** January 17-19, 1969 (three days)

**Installation team:**
- Dave Harries
- Keith Slaughter
- EMI technical team

**Equipment:**
- Beatles asked George Martin to come to rescue
- Martin borrowed two portable 4-track recorders from EMI
- Two portable 4-track mixing consoles combined to create 8-track recording system
- Sound routed into George Harrison's 8-track recorder

**Task given to Geoff Emerick:**
- Building and setting up recording studio with loaned equipment

**Later additions:**
- EMI's mobile console brought in
- Accompanied by newly hired assistant engineer Alan Parsons

**Result:** With new setup in place, Beatles resumed rehearsals at Apple Studios on January 20

### Financial Impact

**Estimated cost of Mardas' ideas and projects:**
- At least £300,000 (£5.24 million in 2019 pounds if essentially spent in 1968)

**After Allen Klein brought in as Beatles' manager (1969):**
- Closed Apple Electronics
- Mardas left company
