## Day 14 Overview (January 23, 1969)

Fourteenth day of "Get Back" sessions - **third day at Apple Studios, focused on developing "Get Back."** Beatles returned to Apple Studio the following day (January 24).

### Overall Atmosphere

**Day's focus:** Development of track "Get Back"

**Billy Preston's continued impact:**
- Joined sessions previous day
- Added new energy to band's work
- Shaped song significantly

**Arrangement solidification:**
- Ringo's drum pattern began to solidify
- George's guitar rhythm took form
- John's guitar solo and backing vocals developed
- Paul decided to simplify structure to just two verses
- Omitted earlier third verse about "Pakistanis"

- Explorations brought arrangement closer to final version
- Iconic coda and "Beatles break" still to come

**Rehearsal statistics:** 43 takes throughout day

**Alan Parsons debut:** Renowned engineer, producer, and musician made debut as tape operator

**Other songs dabbled:**
- "Oh! Darling" (later featured on Abbey Road album)
- Ringo's "Octopus's Garden" (then simple three-chord piano sketch)
- Brief playful renditions of "Please Please Me" (atonal form) and "Help!" (slow swing style)
- Paul attempted Eddie Cochran's "Twenty Flight Rock" (struggled to remember lyrics)

**Mood:**
- Stark contrast to tense Twickenham atmosphere
- Beatles appeared energized and lighthearted
- Smiling, laughing, clearly enjoying creative process
- Took afternoon break to watch film of John's "You Are Here" art gallery show from previous year
- Underscored camaraderie of day
- Explains presence of art dealer Robert Fraser at session

**Ringo Starr reflection:**
"We were working on a good track [Get Back], and that always excited us. And his [Billy Preston's] part was also a part of it, you know. Suddenly, when you were working on something good the bullshit went out the window, and we got back down to doin' what we did really, really well"

### Main Songs Recorded

#### Get Back (Paul)

**This session:** Beatles with Billy Preston solidified arrangement

**Ringo's drum pattern:**
- Galloping drum pattern solidified
- Paul's reflection (McCartney 3,2,1 documentary 2021): "You bring the song in, you kick it around, and then someone gets an idea. 'Oh, why don't we do that?,' or 'How 'bout this on the drums?' or Ringo, like on something like 'Get Back.' We were just kicking it around. There's a little jam and then he gets on the drums, 'bum, buppa, bum, buppa, bum…' He's got this little kind of almost military thing going. Well, that really was, 'Aah, great, different!' It made a world of difference"

**George's chopping guitar pattern:** Taking shape considerably

**John's contributions:**
- Guitar solo work taking shape
- Backing vocals developing

**Structure development:**
- Third verse about "Pakistanis" omitted this day
- Paul, George and John all instrumental in working out structure
- Both John and Billy Preston to perform individual solos

**Solo introductions discussion:**
- Paul thought to vocally introduce solos individually by either of two main characters in lyrics
- "Which do you want to be, Jojo or Loretta?" Paul asks John
- Demonstrates: "'Get back to sweet Loretta! He's waiting for you,' and it's an old drag queen back on the ranch in Tucson, 'wearing his hi-heel shoes!'"

**George's Motown reference:**
- Notes song's similarity to classic Motown hit by The Four Tops
- "It's like 'Reach Out.' Remember in 'Reach Out' where everything stops and then…'I'll be back! (sic)' That's what the song needs, it needs a catchy riff"

**Arrangement decisions:**
- Paul decides to include subdued chorus after first solo
- Introduce next solo section with descending keyboard riff by Billy Preston during break George suggested
- After second guitar solo from John decided upon, decide to try standing up to rehearse newly arranged song
- Results in humorous medley of "Help!" and "Please Please Me" that sends everyone into laughing fit

**Final arrangement status:** Although final "Beatles break" and coda yet to materialize, final arrangement as we know it getting close

**Recording statistics:**
- 43 rehearsals performed this day
- At least 10 attempted as official recordings with Glyn Johns and George Martin in control room

**"Sht" take one:**
- George Martin called out before first official take: "What are you calling this"
- Paul answered: "Sht"
- John added: "Sht Back!"
- George Martin designated: "'Sh*t' take one" before tapes started rolling

**Alan Parsons debut:**
- Young Alan Parsons made debut as tape operator this day
- Long-standing career as engineer, producer and musician beginning by witnessing Beatles formalize "Get Back" before his eyes

**Single discussion:**
- While listening back to recordings in control room, George asked others what their last single was and how long ago it released
- Paul answered: "Hey Jude" roughly five months ago
- **George suggested:** "It'd be nice to do takes until we get it and just have it (out) before the show…Just put it out as a single next week"
- John showed on board: "Let's finish it off for a single tomorrow, and we'll do 'Part Two' on the back side!"
- With this decided (nixing John's idea to put "Get Back (Part Two)" on b-side), had definite goal for next session

**Michael Lindsay-Hogg:** "Mightn't be able to speak"

**Ringo Starr:** "Then we won't get outside, will we?"

**John Lennon:** "Michael was talking in terms of next Thursday. And working over the weekend. So, it's gonna be stupid"

**Paul McCartney:** "Yeah, let's work Saturday, but not Sunday. Just to have one day. 'Cause it does help next week… If you get one day"

**John Lennon:** "Oh, yeah. I'm so tired though. It's amazing"
