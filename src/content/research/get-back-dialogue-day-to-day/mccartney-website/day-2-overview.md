**George Harrison:** "Are we not going to do any 'oldies but goldies' on this show?"

**Paul McCartney:** [Uncertain, but open to it]

**George Harrison:** "There's nobody better to get it out with than us. For me, anyway, really. In my heart of hearts"

**George Harrison:** "If you write a song, I feel as though I've wrote it. And mine versus – vice versa"
