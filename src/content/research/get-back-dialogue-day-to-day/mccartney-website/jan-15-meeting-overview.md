- Efforts lacked enthusiasm and direction

### Meeting Details

**Location:** Brookfield, Ringo Starr's home, Elstead, UK

**2. Relocate rehearsals from Twickenham to Apple's basement studio**

**3. Willing to continue being filmed while making new album**
- Despite scrapping TV special

- Setting stage for fresh start

**January 20:**

### George Harrison's Reflection

**From Beatles Anthology (2000):**
"It was decided that it would be better if we just got back together and finished the record. Also, you see, Twickenham studio was very cold and not a very nice atmosphere, so we decided to abandon that and go to Savile Row, into the recording studio"
