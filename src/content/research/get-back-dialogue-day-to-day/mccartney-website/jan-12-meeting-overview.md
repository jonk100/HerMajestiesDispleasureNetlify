### Paul McCartney's Reflection

**From Classic Rock (May 2020):**
"It was like, no, no, no. Wait a minute, wait a minute. George has left and, you know, we can't have this, this isn't good enough! So I'm not sure what happened. I think maybe Neil [Aspinall] or one of the ones who looked after us probably rung George up and said: 'They're real sorry,' or whatever, 'it was a real big mistake'"

### Business Discussions

**Background - Search for new manager:**
- 1968: At Paul's initiative, Beatles began searching for new manager for Apple
- Paul quickly convinced Lee Eastman (Linda's father, future father-in-law) should take charge of Beatles' financial affairs
- Lee Eastman: New York-based attorney with relevant experience, particularly in music copyrights

**Nat Weiss (Beatles attorney) account (Keith Badman 'Off the Record' 2008):**
"Paul had been agitating for some time for a new manager for Apple. He was fed up with the way that the company was being run and he asked his future father-in-law, Lee, to recommend someone to put the house in order. Lee, of course, recommended his son, John"

**Paul's reasoning (Keith Badman 'Off the Record' 2008):**
"I put the Eastmans up. I thought they would be fair. For one thing, they are lawyers. They don't take percentages, they take a fee. So, they manage you, and, at the end of the year, they put in a bill. And, if you don't like them, you don't pay the bill. Well, you pay the bill, but you sack them for the next year"

**John Eastman's NEMS proposal:**
- Proposed buying NEMS (company previously owned by Brian Epstein, Beatles' former manager)

**John Eastman account (Keith Badman 'Off the Record' 2008):**
"I saw Clive Epstein immediately. I told him, 'Look, you can't get the money out of the company to pay estate taxes, so why don't we buy NEMS and you'll get the money as a capital gain. Forget the twenty-five per cent (NEMS' entitlement of Beatles' royalties). What's the company worth? Eight-hundred-thousand pounds? Nine-hundred-thousand pounds? Forget it, we won't quibble, we'll give you a million!"

**Possible document signed:**
- They May Be Parted blog speculation: Beatles may have signed document granting Eastman & Eastman authority to negotiate contracts on their behalf
- Document only dated "January 1969"
- Timing works out - John Eastman working on deal for NEMS successor company less than week later
- "If only to justify what Ringo described as 'a lot of good things' coming of the meeting, the business aspect must have pointed to a positive development"

### Other Activity

**Paul at EMI Studios:**
- John C. Winn ("That Magic Feeling: 2 - The Beatles' Recorded Legacy"): Paul attended recording session this day (likely evening) at EMI Studios for The Scaffold's "L the P" album
- Did not contribute to recordings

### Chronological Conversations (from January 13 Get Back session)

#### Conversation 1: Paul & Linda - Meeting Composition & Family Outing

**Context:** Paul and Linda discuss who should have been at meeting, feeling it became too much like "family outing"

**Linda Eastman:** "It's harder being at a meeting and everybody putting their two cents in, and none of you all saying anything"

**Paul McCartney:** "But that's the other thing, having the meeting. You came with me, and [Linda's daughter] Heather came"

**Linda Eastman:** "Yeah, I was going to say I shouldn't go"

**Paul McCartney:** "It's such a temptation going out to Ringo's for the afternoon. It feels like a family outing" [said to laughter] [...] "It should have been the four of us"

**Ringo Starr:** "Well you (Linda) were out of the way. It nearly was"

**Paul McCartney:** "It's still that thing"

**Linda Eastman:** "When there's something serious, a few other people talking about it, and you get off the tracks"

#### Conversation 2: Mal & Ringo - Meeting Assessment

**Mal Evans:** "How was the meeting?"

**Ringo Starr:** "The meeting was fine. A lot of good things, but then, you know, they all sort of fell apart in the end"

#### Conversation 3: Linda & Paul - Yoko Speaking for John

**Context:** Discussion about dynamics at meeting, particularly Yoko speaking on John's behalf

**Linda Eastman:** "'Cause I have a feeling that half the stuff Yoko said yesterday isn't… She was talking for John. And I don't think he really believed any of that, you know?"

**Paul McCartney:** "No, so, it's… John didn't talk, so Yoko talked for John"

**Michael Lindsay-Hogg:** "Did George stay?"

**Paul McCartney:** "In the middle of all that, actually… George went. He said 'I'll see you…' See, but their point is that they're trying to be as near together as they can. They wanna stay together, those two. So it's all right. Let the young lovers stay together. But it's not that bad, you know. We got a lot out of Beatles, so that if… I think John's thing now… If it came to a push between Yoko and The Beatles, it's Yoko"

#### Conversation 4: Paul & John - Assuming George's Return

**Paul McCartney:** "See, I'm just assuming [George]'s coming back, you know? I'll tell you, I'm just assuming he's coming back"

**John Lennon:** "What if he isn't?"

**Paul McCartney:** "If he isn't, then it's a new problem"

### Mal Evans Account (Beatles Monthly Book, March 1969)

"Certainly, we wanted sunshine and if we had to do the filming outdoors the British winter weather couldn't be relied upon. Michael [Lindsay-Hogg] and producer Denis O'Dell knew an old Roman theatre on a shore in Tripoli which sounded just the thing. But that one had to be blown out too. On Monday, January 13, I was due to fly over to Africa to look at the Roman theatre. On Sunday, January 12, the fellows finally gave up all idea of doing the TV show"
