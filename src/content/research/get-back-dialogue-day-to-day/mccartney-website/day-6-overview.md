## Day 6 Overview (January 9, 1969)

Sixth day of rehearsals at Twickenham Film Studios. The Beatles returned to Twickenham the following day (January 10).

### Overall Atmosphere

**Morning arrival:**
- Paul first to arrive
- **Accompanied for first time by girlfriend Linda Eastman** (photographer)
- Linda had previously joined some White Album sessions late 1968

**Paul's solo piano work:**
- Early version of "Another Day" (later his first solo single in 1971)
- Debuted "Her Majesty" (short song that would find way onto Abbey Road later that year)

**Once full band arrived:**
- Focused on refining songs from previous days
- Strong performances of "Don't Let Me Down," "Two Of Us," "I've Got A Feeling," "One After 909," "She Came In Through The Bathroom Window"
- Extensive work on "Across The Universe," "For You Blue," "Let It Be"

**First serious attempt at "Get Back":**
- Still more of jam than structured composition
- Early lyrics satirized growing anti-immigration sentiment in Britain
- Echoing rhetoric from politicians like Enoch Powell
- Improvised lines: "Don't dig no Pakistanis taking all the people's jobs," "Don't need no Puerto Ricans living in the USA"
- Later misinterpreted when bootleg recordings surfaced, leading to accusations of racism
- Political theme extended into other improvisations including "Commonwealth" (1950s-style rocker with Paul adopting Elvis Presley-inspired vocal)

**Brief run-throughs:**
- Paul's "Teddy Boy," "Junk," "Penina" (none received much attention)
- Frequent breaks into old rock 'n' roll standards (as in previous days)

**Session productivity:**
- Productive in refining key songs
- Much playing remained loose and exploratory
- Fewer prolonged discussions or musical disagreements
- **Atmosphere noticeably more relaxed than some previous days**

### Main Songs Recorded

#### The Long And Winding Road (Paul)

**Previous work:** 
- Rehearsed alone on piano January 3 and 7
- Began teaching chords to others January 8

**This session:** While waiting for rest of band to arrive, Paul sat at piano working on lyrics with input from Mal Evans

**Mal Evans collaboration:**
- Mal asks: "Do you have any more words to write out? More songs?"
- Paul starts dictating what he has so far

**Lyric development:**
- After first verse, Paul sings: "The second verse that I haven't got yet – leave a space for the same thing, la, la, la"
- **Mal's movie reference:** "Did you ever see the Wizard Of Oz?" (mentions "the yellow brick road")
- Paul: "No, No, No I didn't"

**Bridge experimentation:**
- Paul tries to incorporate word "pleasure"
- "All the pleasure from the many ways I've tried"
- States idea: "'I've had lots of pleasure' but said better, y'know, 'I've had many pleasure ever, much, much'"

**Third verse discussion:**
- Paul sings: "You left me waiting here"
- **Mal suggests:** "Use 'standing'"
- Paul: "You like 'standing' better?"
- Mal: "Yeah, put 'waiting' there and 'standing' here"
- After Paul demonstrates, tells Mal: "There's no more to that yet. Just call that 'middle'"

**Second verse ideas:**
- Mal asks if Paul has "any ideas for the second verse"
- Paul: "I was thinking of having, like another, like the weather obstacle"
- Sings: "The storm clouds la, la, rain break apart while you roam"
- **Mal suggests:** "The black and stormy rainclouds which gather 'round your door"
- Paul smiles: "I suppose it should still be about the sort of winding road. I've just got that picture. It'll be like that thing that's up ahead"
- Paul humorously sings: "The thing that's up ahead"
- Mal suggests: "Like, what about the obstacles on the road?"
- **Paul replies:** "No, I think, y'know, there's enough obstacles without putting them in the song"

**Following days:** Paul continued to improve lyrics

**Formal introduction:** January 26 in earnest

#### For You Blue (George)

**Previous work:** Introduced January 6 and 7, initially solo instrumental piece

**This session:** Four Beatles rehearsed extensively (15 versions total)
- Lyrics still being developed
- George referred to it as "folk/blues" song

**George's arrangement vision:**
- Wanted it to sound like "those bluesy people, but the folky ones"
- Had in mind Son House (veteran blues performer recently rediscovered, brought out of retirement in blues revival of 60s)

**Initial versions:**
- Few acoustic guitar versions
- Eventually joined by Paul on piano and John playing walking bass line on electric guitar
- Moved on to other tunes like "Two Of Us"
- Paul and John may not have viewed composition too seriously, but obviously enjoying vamping to 12-bar blues pattern

**Lyrics status:** Not completely formed
- George focusing on lines: "Because your're sweet and lovely girl, I love you" and "I love you more than ever"

**Later that day (quarter to four):**
- Paul complaining: "It was a little bit loud for me"
- **John replies:** "Leave the group then, if you don't like it!"
- Paul yells out for "technicians"
- John references "Hotel Liverpool" while running through impromptu rendition

**Line-up:**
- George and John on electric guitars
- Paul on bass
- Ringo on drums (their standard line-up)

**Amid false starts:**
- Ran through song number of times
- Jamming on oldies: "Honey Hush," "Be-Bop-A-Lula," "Slippin' And Slidin'"
- George still hadn't formulated lyrics fully
- **John states:** "Pretty short, isn't it?" after one rehearsal

#### I've Got A Feeling (Paul + John composite)

**Previous work:** January 2, 3, 6, 7, and 8

**This session:** 5 performances

**Let It Be movie footage:**
- Excerpts from one performance spliced together with January 8 footage
- Paul sitting down, George wearing dark colored shirt (not red shirt as previous day, revealing edit job)
- John reverting to singing "everybody got a face-lift" in couple places
- Singing in Americanized nasal tone
- Repeating "oh yeah?" several times during conclusion
- As song ends, John plays mock concluding guitar riff with many intentionally sour notes
- Captured twice in movie from different camera angles

**George's guitar:**
- Playing through wah-wah pedal
- Eventually decided against for all Get Back/Let It Be songs except John's use in "Across The Universe"

**Paul's instruction to George (featured in movie):**
- Regarding descending guitar riff at conclusion of bridge
- "It's coming down too fast, the note"
- "No, there shouldn't be any recognizable jumps. It's got to be like pain. At the moment, it's like a riff. Do anything that's like it's crying…It's, like, falling, falling!"
- George attempts to follow Paul's wishes
- Eventually nails it as sessions continue

#### One After 909 (Lennon-McCartney)

**Previous work:** January 3, 6, 7, and 8

**This session:** 4 performances
- George still playing lead guitar through wah-wah pedal

**Let It Be movie footage:**
- Two versions edited together and featured in film
- Prefaced by Paul explaining how he and John would "sag off every school day" to write songs at his house in early days

**Paul's introduction in film:**
"One of the first songs we'd ever done. We all used to sag off every school day, you know, and go back to my house. And the two of us would just sit there and write 'Love Me Do' and 'Too Bad About Sorrows.' And there's a lot from then, about 100 songs from then that we never reckoned. 'Cuz they were all very unsophisticated songs, but they're great, you know"

#### She Came In Through The Bathroom Window (Paul)

**Previous work:** January 7 and 8

**This session:** 7 performances
- Devoted more time to it
- Usually rehearsed much slower (one aimless version on January 8)

**Arrangement:**
- Band had worked out arrangement quite nicely
- John joining proficiently on harmony vocals during choruses

**Instrumentation:**
- Paul: bass and lead vocals
- John: piano and harmony vocals
- George: Fender Telecaster run through Leslie speaker and wah pedal
- Ringo: drums

**Beatles got quite silly:**
- One version at "one o'clock" counted out by Paul in German
- Featured lead vocals by John in thick Cockney accent
- Paul provided off-the-cuff responses to fill spaces after each of John's lead vocal lines
- Example: "a bloody spoon, a bloody spoon, a bloody silver spoon"

**Another rehearsal (2021 Get Back series):**
- Paul: "So, do you want to try another one? Once more…"
- John: "…with feeling"
- Paul: "…with Felix!"

**Second verse:** Paul altered lyrics to "and though she thought I had the answer, I just had to sail away"

**Third verse Paul/John interchange:**
- Paul: "And so I quit the police department"
- John: "Get a job, cop!"
- Paul: "And got myself a proper job"
- John: "Bloody 'bout time too, if you ask me"
- Paul: "And though she tried her best to help me"
- John: "You bloody need it, too"

#### Get Back (Paul)

**Previous work:** Conceived January 7 from unstructured jam session

**This session:** Returned to hash out 4 renditions of unfinished song
- First time Lennon became acquainted with it
- After lot of work on "Let It Be" and "For You Blue," among others

**Verse lyrics:** Still ad-libbed
- Bits of rough storyline beginning to emerge
- References to California and Arizona in first couple renditions

**Political satire development:**
- Local news items about Parliament member Enoch Powell's beliefs discussed
- Powell believed too many non-white citizens of British Empire immigrating to England, taking away limited jobs
- Paul struggling to piece together coherent lyrics
- **John humorously proposed infusion of this subject matter to create political satire**

**John's demonstration:** "Don't want no black man…!"

**Paul's counter:** "Don't dig no Pakistanis taking all the people's jobs"

**Performance:**
- Paul directs band into another rendition
- Screaming "Get Back!" repeatedly in voice that mocks hatred behind Enoch Powell's public statements

**Verses included:**
- Paul singing: "lots of Puerto Ricans"
- "All the folks around sit by, he a Mohican living in the USA"
- "Don't dig no Pakistanis taking all the people's jobs"
- Song finishes with Paul screaming out maniacally (similar to how John concluded "Cold Turkey" to simulate heroin withdrawal)
- Since John's song recorded later that year, easy to conclude this early "Get Back" rendition may have been remembered, possibly his inspiration (if only subliminally)

**More serious rehearsal:**
- After satire was out of their systems
- Principal characters Joe and Theresa introduced for first time

**"Commonwealth" improvisation:**
- Little later that day, Enoch Powell's beliefs once again subject of ad-libbed song
- Harold Wilson and Edward Heath referenced in lyrics (see "Taxman")
- Paul begins mimicking recent British hit "Israelites" by Desmond Dekker (reggae beat and distinctive vocalization)
- Song transcends into more typical 12-bar pattern as heard in early Elvis recordings
- John adds to fun by suggesting to end each chorus with "The commonwealth is much too common for me"

#### Across The Universe (John)

**Previous work:** 
- Reintroduced to band January 6
- 12 rehearsals January 7

**This session:** 12 more rehearsals
- Undoubtedly spurred on by hearing original recording two days earlier

**Performance quality:**
- Rough unfocused performances
- Occasionally strewn with semi-humorous lyrical changes
- Interesting tongue-in-cheek fast version with rhythm somewhat similar to "I'll Cry Instead" (seen in Get Back series)

#### Let It Be (Paul)

**Previous work:**
- Paul introduced January 3 (developing since at least September 1968)
- Brought to group January 8, began working together

**This session:** 16 run-throughs

**Aretha Franklin discussion:**
- George suggested that since it had gospel feel, Paul should present it to Aretha Franklin to record
- **Paul responded:** "Do it AND give it to her. As soon as we've got it, then we should get the tapes and do a rough demo when it's the first rehearsal. It'd be great for Aretha Franklin, that number"

**Paul's elaboration (Let It Be Anniversary edition book):**
"What I used to like to do was think who would I really like to do this so, if we weren't jealously guarding a song for some reason, I would get an early version to people I would love to record it. I sent 'Let It Be' to Aretha Franklin"

**Result:** Her rendition included on "This Girl's In Love With You" album (released January 15, 1970, nearly two months prior to Beatles' released version)

### Chronological Conversations

#### Conversation 1: Libya/Boat Discussion Resurfaced - Ringo's Opposition

**Context:** Previous day, Michael Lindsay-Hogg and Denis O'Dell attempted to persuade Beatles to perform abroad. John enthusiastic, Paul inclined to agree, but Ringo and George opposed. On this day, discussion resurfaced with Ringo expressing opposition more firmly than before.

**Michael Lindsay-Hogg:** "Go out on Sunday and finish it on Sunday. I think we spend 'til the middle of next week here. Go out, do it the following weekend, in other words, eight days"

**Ringo Starr:** "I went off the boat, actually"

**Michael Lindsay-Hogg:** "The only thing is, it's, um… I think… I really do think it's gonna be for the world"

**Ringo Starr:** "The biggest part of our world is America and England"

**Linda Eastman:** "It's true"

**Michael Lindsay-Hogg:** "Yes, but they do think of you as for everybody in the world. That's one of the things I thought was good about 'Jude,' the guy in the turban"

**Ringo Starr:** "Yeah"

#### Conversation 2: UK Venue Alternatives - Mal & Paul

**Context:** Various alternative locations in UK briefly considered. Mal Evans suggested Twickenham Studios, Paul proposed farm. By end of day, no idea gained traction.

**Mal Evans:** "What do you think of… Where to do the show? Did you think about it last night?"

**Paul McCartney:** (shaking head to say no)

**Mal Evans:** "It's gonna be an indoor… It's gonna be indoor… inside a building"

**Paul McCartney:** "The airport and the Houses of Parliament aren't the right ones, but if, you know, we hit the right one…"

**Mal Evans:** "I think it's down to if we're going to do it in this country, we might as well do it here"

**Paul McCartney:** "But actually… We're going on a farm in Scotland"

**Mal Evans:** "What?"

**Paul McCartney:** "Kidding… Yugoslavia"

**Linda Eastman:** "I'd love to find… a farm"

**Michael Lindsay-Hogg:** "Yes, Paul was saying yesterday, a farm"

#### Conversation 3: Show Format & Covers Discussion

**George Harrison:** "If we are in a groovy location place, we can make the show about different bits and pieces of what we've done. Or we have to do it in one consecutive piece"

**John Lennon:** "I think we could do both, you see? We should do it about three times. We'd settle on one day when we say, 'This is the show.' But we'd do a, like, dress rehearsal"

**George Harrison:** "Okay. Shall we do some other people's tunes as well?"

**Unknown:** "That'd be nice"

**John Lennon:** "I don't know any. I can only just bear doing your lot's songs"

**George Harrison:** "Some other people's songs are much better than ours"

**John Lennon:** "That's why I don't learn 'em"
