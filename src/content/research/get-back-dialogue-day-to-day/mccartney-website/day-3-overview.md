## Day 3 Overview (January 6, 1969)

Third day of "Get Back" sessions at Twickenham Studios following weekend break. The Beatles returned to Twickenham the following day (January 7).

### Overall Atmosphere

**Progress remained elusive:**
- George: Perhaps only half-joking, suggested scrapping the live show idea
- Ringo: Not feeling well
- John: Largely silent throughout
- Paul: Usually the driving force, seemed uncertain about direction

**Morning session:**
- Largely unfocused
- Mostly jamming and going through oldies
- Little structure or productivity

**After lunch:**
- Discussions about live show dragged on without resolution
- Rehearsals lacked energy
- Day ended with tension and frustration

**Day's assessment:** Largely unproductive, with extensive time spent in discussions and disagreements

### Morning Session Activities

**Improvisations and jams:**
- "The Palace Of The King Of The Birds" (McCartney instrumental, recorded years later for unreleased "Rupert The Bear" soundtrack)
- "You Wear Your Women Out" (blues jam)
- "My Imagination" (Paul experimenting with Primal Therapy-style screaming)
- Various oldies

**New songs introduced:**
- George: "Hear Me Lord," "For You Blue"
- Ringo: "Octopus's Garden"
- Paul: "Carry That Weight"
- John: Revisited "Across the Universe" (1968 track)

**Next sessions:** January 7 and January 9

#### Carry That Weight (Paul)

**Performances:**
- 4 attempts
- Paul on organ and vocals
- John on electric guitar and periodic backing vocals

#### Don't Let Me Down (John)

**Previous work:** January 2 and 3

**This session:**
- 28 versions performed
- Nailed down guitar introduction for finished recording
- Attempted many harmonies, lyrical changes, falsetto voices, call-and-response vocals
- Much experimentation later dropped

**Keyboard discussion:**
- Discussion about presence of keyboard on finished song
- George offered to move to bass to allow Paul on keyboard
- John insisted on wanting two guitars in arrangement
- "No overdubs" policy meant keyboardist needed to be enlisted to fulfill Lennon's desire

**George's wah-wah:** Used on many rehearsals to differentiate two guitarists

**Some versions heard on:** "Fly On The Wall" disc (Let It Be...Naked release)

**Energy level:** Lacked energy, various arrangements failed to take shape

**Next session:** January 7

#### Two Of Us (Paul)

**Previous work:** January 2 and 3

**This session:**
- 20 rehearsals
- Played with rhythmic feel that would eventually be used on "Get Back" (not yet written)
- Arranged as straight-ahead rocker with electric guitars
- Witnessed early in "Let It Be" movie (filmed this day)

**Frustrations:** Rehearsals equally frustrating, tempers flared between George and Paul

**Tension point:** Guitarist told his complicated guitar riffs need to be simplified

**Next session:** Briefly on January 8

#### She Came In Through The Bathroom Window (Paul)

**Context:** Introduced on just third day of rehearsals, suggesting Paul saw it as potential contender for live show

#### Conversation 2: Paul-George Tension During "Two Of Us" Rehearsals (Day's Lowest Point)

**Featured in:** Michael Lindsay-Hogg's "Let It Be" film

**Paul McCartney:** "See, look. Listen, now. We're gonna have to sort of bring it together, 'cause we're all at odds. We're doing that thing we did on 'The Beatles'. Like, in this verse, it's two harmonies singing, trying to say some words, right?"

**John Lennon:** "I'm not that bothered. I'm just trying to sing it"

**Paul McCartney:** "It's not sounding together"

**George Harrison:** "And so we can only play until we find the bit"

**Paul McCartney:** "Or we can stop and say it's not together"

**George Harrison:** "Yes, then you've got to carry on until it gets together"

**John Lennon:** "These are the hard ones to do, aren't they?"

**Paul McCartney:** "No, not really, it's just... We've got to be imaginative. You know, it's complicated now. See, if we can get it simpler and then complicate it where it needs complication, but it's complicated in the bit..."

**George Harrison:** "It's not complicated. I'll play just the chords, if you like"

**Paul McCartney:** "No, no, come on. You always get annoyed when I say that. I'm trying to help, you know. But I always hear myself annoying you, and I'm trying..."

**George Harrison:** "No, you're not annoying me. You don't annoy me anymore"

**Paul McCartney:** "But you see what I mean. We do this then... Then I don't know" [...]

**Paul McCartney:** "I'm scared of me being the boss. And I have been for a couple of years. I always feel as though I'm trying to put you down and stop you playing. But I'm not. I'm trying to stop us all playing, until we know what we're playing"

**George Harrison:** "But you've got to play in order to find which fits and which doesn't. You see that's all we can do"

**Paul McCartney:** "I don't wanna say it, 'cause I really just hear myself as being the only one saying it, always. And like, the three of you just sort of sit there, like 'Oh, he's saying that one again, is he?' And I never get any support, or anything. So I just think, 'Oh, well. Fuck it'. And I know it's right, and you know it's right"

**George Harrison:** "Yes, all right. I just don't know what to do about it"

**Paul McCartney:** "But doesn't everyone agree that it's confused at the moment. So, all I'm trying to say is, we've only got 12 more days, so we've really got to do this methodically, this one"

**George Harrison:** "I'll wait until you get all your bits and then work my part out, if you like. It's like a matter of working it out with you, while you're working your bit out. You know, have you got your bass bit?"

**Paul McCartney:** "You're doing it again as though I'm trying to say that. And what we said the other day, you know, I'm not trying to get you. What I really am trying to just say, 'Look lads, the band, shall we try it like this, you know?'"

**George Harrison:** "It's funny how it only occurs when the..."

**Paul McCartney:** "It's like 'shall we play guitar all through Hey Jude? Well, I don't think we should'"

**George Harrison:** "Okay, well, I don't mind. I'll play whatever you want me to play. Or I won't play at all if you don't want me to play. Now, whatever it is that will please you, I'll do it. But I don't think you really know what that one is" [...]

#### Conversation 3: Continuation - Working Methods and Time Management

**Paul McCartney:** "Look, you know, the... [sighs] No, it's not like that. You see, that's it, it's like, we can't do this. We've really got to sort out this, 'cause we're – this is – we're like – this is the one, you know. Now we're rehearsing, and we're trying to like get it together for a TV show, so we really – like you said, we've only been through four numbers, you know"

**George Harrison:** "Mm"

**John Lennon:** "Well..."

**Paul McCartney:** "So we've probably got to get some system to get through like twenty, or thirty, and no more, and have learnt them. And it's probably going to be like sculpture. So that we get all the chords. So we can all vamp and all. Then we can all play, like, every solo we need. But like... You know what I mean? It's got to sound as though it's improving"

**George Harrison:** [careful] "Yeah, well, it actually – it sounded to me, that for me, it was a waste of me time playing, when we started it today. I mean, I just started remembering then what it could get into the other day, after playing for around an hour, an hour and a half. And suddenly, you know, I just don't find that my – that what I'm doing is starting to have something, you know. Have some structure to it. [pause] You know, that's the thing"

**Paul McCartney:** "Yeah, I know, I know what you mean, you know. 'Cause it's like—"

**George Harrison:** "You know, I mean—"

**Paul McCartney:** "It's just that that way of doing it, you know, puts me off the way I'm trying to do it, and—"

**George Harrison:** [resigned] "Well, that's – you know. That's all, then. I can only do me, in that one way, however I do it, you know" [long pause]

**Paul McCartney:** [resigned] "Let's do another song"

**George Harrison:** [commiserating] "No, come on, we just have to learn this—"

**Paul McCartney:** "No, no, it's – let's just do something else"

**George Harrison:** "Do you want to do... 'Maxwell's Silver Hammer'?"

**John Lennon:** [encouraging] "Well, let's do this, 'cause then we – we're gonna come to this, or whatever it is. And the thing is just try and think what – the stage we've got to be in then"

**Paul McCartney:** "You just have to know that. I think we've wasted a lot of time, I think. I think we do like waste, physically waste a heck of a lot of time, you know, when the four of us are together"
