## Day 18 Overview (January 27, 1969)

Eighteenth day of "Get Back" sessions - **7th day at Apple Studios, critical day recording definitive "Get Back" take.** Beatles returned to Apple Studio the following day (January 28), with session beginning with Glyn Johns playing back results of his overnight mixes.

### Overall Atmosphere

**Session timing:** Ran from around noon until just after 9:00 p.m.

**Day's focus:** Primarily on song "Get Back"

**Session began:** George Harrison introducing new composition "Old Brown Shoe"
- Written previous night
- Performed on piano
- Later in day rehearsed with Paul, Ringo and Billy Preston after John stepped out to grab food
- **Band's first attempt at song**
- Later released as b-side to "The Ballad of John and Yoko"

**Glyn Johns:** Played rough mixes created following previous day's recordings

**Session progression:**
- Rehearsals of "Let It Be" and "The Long And Winding Road" (takes not particularly successful, not captured on multi-track)
- Shifted focus to "Don't Let Me Down" (despite several takes, none considered refined enough to move forward)
- Attempts at "Oh, Darling" (track later on Abbey Road album, one released in edited form on "Anthology 3" 1996)

**Latter part of session:** Dedicated to "Get Back"
- 32 takes recorded
- Experimented with different tempos and styles
- Playful mock German version
- Take featuring Japanese characters
- **"Sweet Loretta Fart" ad-lib recorded during warm-up, made it onto Let It Be album**
- **One take from this session later used for single version (released April 1969) and album version (1970)**
- Take lacked coda (recorded January 28)

**Session close:** Several attempts at "I've Got A Feeling"
- One mixed by Glyn Johns for his "Get Back" album (March 1969)

**Rooftop concert arrangements (conceived January 25):**
- Tentatively scheduled for Wednesday, January 29
- Practical arrangements made this day
- Discussions about renting helicopter to film performance
- Engineers evaluating need to reinforce roof to support band and audience

**Evening:** John and Yoko met with American businessman Allen Klein at Dorchester Hotel, London
- Impressed by Klein, John immediately decided to appoint him as personal adviser
- Other Beatles would meet with Klein following day

**Mal Evans diary entry (January 27):**
"Today we had the engineer to look at the roof of No. 3. 5lbs sq. in is all it will take weight wise. Needs scaffolding to make platform. Getting helicopter for shot of roof. Should get good shot of crowds in street, who knows police might try to stop us. Asked Alistair [Taylor, Apple office manager] to get toasted sandwich machine"

**Ringo Starr reflection (Postcards from the boys, 2004):**
"Another great card from Paul. 1969 — by now everything was tough except the moments when we played and that was the saving grace. Once the music started we were always okay because we still did our best. Then afterwards there would be lots of heated discussions. Maybe this is before we had the big meeting at Brookfields where we asked George to come back to The Beatles after he'd left when Paul had really, really pissed him off at Twickenham"

### Main Songs Recorded

#### Let It Be (Paul)

**This session:** 12 more versions with Billy Preston

**Arrangement status:** Final arrangement pretty set by this time
- Did some experimentation this day

**Experiments:**
- Some versions: George and John played guitar and bass riffs during early part of song
- Billy experimented with different organ parts
- Even substituted electric piano instead of organ

**After one soulful electric piano rendition:**
- Paul remarks: "Of course, coming from the North of England, it doesn't come through easy in all the soul"
- Prompts laugh from Billy

**George's work:** Took time to work through lead guitar part during song's final chorus

**Lyrics status:** Paul still didn't have lyrics to final set of verses written
- Sometimes sang scat vocals
- John adding what Bruce Spizer describes as "inappropriate vocal ad-libs, perhaps out of boredom"

**"Ploddy" discussion (Get Back documentary series):**
- After "f bit" played in one rehearsal, Paul states: "It's a bit ploddy"
- John: "What?"
- Paul: "It just sorts of plods along a bit"
- John explains: "It's just morning and slow; and a slow song. It takes a long time to get out of it"
- Paul relented: "That'll do for the time being" before moving on to "The Long And Winding Road" (also wasn't feeling inspired by this day)

**Status:** With time frame to complete project nearing end, all that left was for Paul to complete lyrics - everyone pretty much had parts perfected

#### The Long And Winding Road (Paul)

**This session:** 6 rehearsals

**Paul's mood:** Feeling bit down after attempts at "Let It Be"
- Thought to change gears, put in more work on other ballad
- Introduced tune as "The Wrong And Winding Box"

**Performances:** Bruce Spizer describes as "a few deliberately off-the-wall performances, including one in which John did most of the singing and Paul mimicked Al Jolson"

**Serious attempt decision:** Made to record serious attempt to see if could better previous day's version
- Featured Ringo using brushes, many times performing fast snare drum rolls
- John came in on backing vocals twice during lines "still they lead me back"

**Paul's discouraged mood continued:**
- "It's like the other one" (in reference to "Let It Be")
- "Slow, ballady and like they're plodding a bit…I can't, sort of, think how to do this one at all, y'know. My mind's a blank on it. I don't know. Dunno. Give up!"
- Moved directly into working on other songs, including recording official released version of "Get Back" (lifted morale very nicely)

**Control room discussion (end of day):**
- Paul: "The two slow ones, 'Mother Mary' and 'Brother Jesus,' they haven't happened yet" (meaning neither "Let It Be" nor "The Long And Winding Road" recorded properly yet)
- **Glyn Johns still pushing for using January 26th recording** as he'd done previous day
- Glyn Johns explains: "I think it's very tasty"
- Paul: "Oh, the little version we...?"
- Glyn Johns insists: "I'm not saying you can't do it better, I'm saying it's very together"
- **Glyn Johns got his way in end**

#### Get Back (Paul)

**This session:** 32 renditions recorded
- Most officially recorded by George Martin and engineers Glyn Johns and Alan Parsons

**Before tapes rolling:**
- Beatles and Billy Preston ran through song few times for rehearsal
- Eventually confident ready to record definitive version

**John's guitar intro (Get Back series):**
- Seen slapping guitar strings during introduction
- Part strategically increasing in volume as progressed

**Fast tempo rendition:**
- Paul singing first verse in mock Japanese
- Including phrase "sock it to me" (residual from obsession with American TV show "Rowan & Martin's Laugh In," referenced many times in January 1969 rehearsals/recording sessions)

**Tapes rolling - many good takes recorded:**
- After roughly estimated "take 9" (may actually have been "take 18")
- Paul's exclamation "nearly" caught on tape (suggesting getting close)
- McCartney's vocal hijinks this day may indicate being under influence of some substance
- Knowledge that releasable take recorded this day indicates this ended up being good idea in long run

**Variations:**
- Varying guitar solos from John
- Slight tempo alterations per George Martin's and Paul's suggestions
- Suitable atmosphere to achieve acceptable master take

**Coda experiments:**
- One rendition: Paul sang "it's five o'clock, your mother's got your tea on, take your cap off, sit down, you're bloody not coming in"
- Another take: "one, two, three o'clock, four o'clock rock" from Bill Haley's "Rock Around The Clock"

**DEFINITIVE SINGLE AND ALBUM VERSION:**
- Eventually recorded this day
- **Just before performance began, John humorously remarked:** "Sweet Loretta Fart (pronounced in Liverpudlian accent) she thought she was a cleaner, but she was a frying pan…picks with his fingers"
- **This vocal segment, along with extraneous studio sounds, included on released soundtrack album**

**The take following "Sweet Loretta Fart":**
- Ended up becoming basis for both single and album
- **Rehearsed coda not played** - Ringo forgetting to come back in after break near song's conclusion
- After Paul sings iconic "oooh," George states: "We missed that end, didn't we?"
- George Martin: "I thought you were going on. Do you want to end it like that?"
- **Ringo replied:** "Just Plug it on – the best end we did"

**Although flubbed ending propelled into multiple new recorded versions:**
- Above mentioned take ultimately deemed best

**Later recordings:**
- One rendition with pseudo-German lyrics throughout
- Acknowledging Jackie Lomax influence with phrase "Yah, that's good, Jackie"
- Final verse in mock French
- Very entertaining, eventually gracing various bootleg releases
- Obvious they'd previously recorded definitive version this day
- Celebrating event in rather unconventional way

#### Old Brown Shoe (George)

**This session:** Introduced - written previous night
- Performed on piano
- Later rehearsed with Paul, Ringo and Billy Preston after John stepped out to grab food
- Band's first attempt at song
- Later released as b-side to "The Ballad of John and Yoko"

#### Don't Let Me Down (John)

**This session:** Several takes
- None considered refined enough to move forward

#### Oh, Darling (Paul)

**This session:** Attempts
- Track later appeared on Abbey Road album
- One released in edited form on "Anthology 3" (1996)

#### I've Got A Feeling (Paul + John composite)

**This session:** Several attempts at session close
- One mixed by Glyn Johns for his "Get Back" album (March 1969)

### Chronological Conversations

#### Conversation 1: Morning - Glyn Johns' Police Encounter & Paul's Stories

**Context:** From 'a moral to this song' blog - As Glyn Johns grouses about having been apprehended by police on petty driving charge (causing him to be late), Paul commiserates and humorously shares own peeved exchanges with policemen on road.

**Paul:** "Let me take you down, 'cause I'm going to…"

**Glyn:** "Can you believe that bleeding copper! [stuffy voice] 'Oh, alright, I'll have to report this, you know, anything you say will be taken down,' and it went through all that!"

**John:** "Have you got a fag?"

**Glyn:** "Yeah"

**Paul:** "I had a terrible scene the other day on the motorway with a copper. 'Cause they stopped me, and I – I don't like it, getting stopped by police. I always get – I get obnoxious with them, you know. [Yoko laughs] 'Cause I'll just sort of check around to see if I'm in the right, and once I know I am, and they've stopped me, I get very… But they just stopped me because I was hogging the outside lane, and you're not supposed to do that. So he said, 'You did, you know.' You're going seventy. You've got to stay out there, but you're not supposed to get back in. So he stopped me, and then it really got sort of nasty after a bit. 'Cause Linda just had her hand round the back of my head, and then he said, 'You can't possibly be in – in control!'"

**Yoko:** [laughs] "Oh, no"

**Paul:** "'You see how that young lady was fondling the back of your neck…' [uproarious laughter] And I said, 'Oh, what's up with you, then? Don't you get it?' [laughter] You know, and it got really like that. 'Oh! You can't book me for that, Constable!' You know, it got really sort of… 'Oh, can't I!' [laughter] And of course, my tax. [laughs] They got me. My tax wasn't up to date and all"

**John:** "Don't they just do it at the office for us?"

**Paul:** "No"

**John:** "Oh. I probably haven't had one done since I started, then" [laughter]

**Paul:** "They keep doing that. I was going through Mersey Tunnel, and they keep stopping me in the Mersey Tunnel 'cause they see you and they just want an autograph. So I sort of thought, 'Right, this time, they're not going to stop me.' And a fella comes up, and I just – all the way through the tunnel, I did thirty. Just saw him in the mirror all the time. I thought, 'You… you're going to stop me at the end and ask me for an autograph.'

So he just sort of drives in front of me waves me down, so I'm just — ah! [laughter] – crash in with him and say, 'No, no, I have no time, no time!' And he just… [grumbling] So he stopped me and said, '… Your tax.' [laughter] Yeah. I can't stand that, I really go sort of funny with police. You know, police [inaudible] when nothing's been done, fighting against them before they've got me for anything. I don't like it"

#### Conversation 2: George Arrives - "Old Brown Shoe" & Finishing Songs

**Context:** From 'a moral to this song' blog - Chipper George last to arrive at studio while rest having breakfast. Tells group he was up previous night writing song (prompting John to reveal he's been having trouble sleeping himself), in mind of John's old advice to finish song within time you start writing it. In full awareness of John's own less-than-disciplined creative process, incites knowing laughter from group. (Note: Song George wrote was "Old Brown Shoe")

**John:** "I have a complaint as a director of Apple – no bog paper"

**Paul:** "Oh yeah?" [Yoko laughs]

**John:** "Terrible disgrace"

**Paul:** "They've got [it in] pink upstairs"

**John:** "Have they?"

**Paul:** "Yeah" [George arrives]

**John:** "Hi"

**Paul:** "Hi, George"

**George:** "Hello, how are you? Happy new year!"

**John:** [joking] "George's just come from a party too"

**George:** [laughs] "Yeah, I thought…"

**John:** "Two hours extra sleep [inaudible]"

**George:** "Oh, I didn't, I went to bed very late. I wrote a new song, actually"

**John:** "I couldn't sleep"

**George:** "I wrote a great song actually"

**John:** "About what?" [taps out familiar rhythm in question]

**George:** "No, though – oh that, no, I just played with that bit. Just – a different one, altogether. Very exciting" [laughs]

**John:** "It's such a high when you get home"

**Yoko:** "Mm"

**George:** "Happy. Happy, and a rocker…"

**Paul:** "Yeah?"

**George:** "Happy and a rocker!" [laughs] "Too much"

...

**John:** "Well, it's just so high when you get in at night"

**George:** "Yeah, it's great, isn't it?" [laughs]

**John:** "I just – you know, that bit like on acid, where you see a little hand miles away"

**Paul:** "Mm"

**John:** "I was just sitting there listening to the last bit. [stage whisper] 'Help! What if I have? What if I haven't, today?' [laughter] You know, '[inaudible] Do they have anything?'"

**Yoko:** "You should just try in general"

**John:** "I just can't sleep! I just—" [starts making garbled noises and sounds] "You know. 'I'm a feeling a little thing here…'" [makes sound of trumpet blaring; laughs]

**George:** "Uh, I keep thinking, 'Oh, I'll just go to bed now,' and then I keep hearing your voice from about ten years ago saying, 'Finish 'em straightaway. As soon as you start 'em, you've got finish it too'" [pause] "You once told me it was best to finish a song, so I was just there to…" [uproarious laughter]

**John:** [laughs] "But I never do it, you know. I can't do it. But I know it's the best"

**Paul:** "Yeah"

---

#### Conversation 3: "You Are Here" Book - Press Articles

**Context:** From 'a moral to this song' blog - Over breakfast, John shows Paul book he's had compiled of various press articles covering John and Yoko's You Are Here art show. Paul reads aloud from some articles to amusement of John and Yoko.

**Paul:** "'Beatle John Lennon hugged actress Yoko Ono last night and said, "My marriage is over. I am in love with Yoko. Of course my wife and I are not through legally—"'"

**John:** "That they put 'actress' is great"

**Yoko:** [laughs] "No, they thought I performed in the Bottoms film" [laughter] "They took it so seriously…"

**John:** "Said it seriously"

**Paul:** "'How much does he love Yoko? "Much more than I love the Queen."'" [laughter; Paul hums]

**John:** "The layout of the book's really good though, the way he's done it"

**Paul:** "This – is this the layout?"

**John:** "No, this is just the bit – that bit, you know. Because he's gonna have that folding out of the book, sheets, like, because – to get them all together. But it's just, you know. The packaging is great"

**Paul:** "It's good, yeah. Great" [inaudible; continues reading articles aloud]

**?:** "What else is there?"

**John:** "There's hundreds of things, you know, this is just the press part of it. There's all the letters I got, and the photos of the exhibition, and – yeah"

**?:** "Oh, just this topic"

**John:** "Yeah. The whole You Are Here book, you know. Book of the film of the video"

**?:** "And the policeman. Is that included in the film? The statement—"

**John:** "No, no. This is just – just that one day. Reaction to one day"

**Yoko:** "It's amazing, isn't it? Just for that one day"

**Paul:** "Yes"

**John:** "But it's just great you know, it's sort of like what we're doing now. We're doing a show, and then you bring in a book of the show—"

**Paul:** "Yeah"

**?:** "Who's doing it?"

**John:** "Uh, publishing it?"

**?:** "Yeah"

**John:** "Cape. That's what I think—"

**Yoko:** "That's what – I think that's where we're going with, Cape"

**John:** "Yeah, I'm gonna go to Cape"

**Paul:** "Is there a next book that you'll be expecting?"

**John:** "Yeah, but I owe it [inaudible] in the contract"

**Paul:** "Oh, indeed. Great"

**John:** "So they'll have to pay for it, and it's expensive. The other one's cost nothing to do"

**?:** "Who does this for you?"

**Yoko:** "Oh, the [inaudible] or something"

**?:** "Oh, you have a [clipping] service, do you? Yeah, great"

#### Conversation 4: Helicopter Rental for Rooftop Performance

**Context:** Later in day, Michael Lindsay-Hogg mentioned idea of renting helicopter for live performance on roof.

**Michael Lindsay-Hogg:** "The show on Wednesday, which is up on the roof, we can get, uh, no worse than a 4-shot on the roof out toward London, which I think is worth it"

**John Lennon:** "Yes. How much does it cost?"

**Michael Lindsay-Hogg:** "Between a thousand and twelve hundred"

**John Lennon:** "Well, just send the helicopter up. No film. It's too much, film and a helicopter. Uh, what do you say, lads? Have it on Paul!"

**Ringo / Michael / Yoko:** "Yeah"

**Michael Lindsay-Hogg:** "Is that a yes?"

**Paul McCartney:** "That's a no-no"
