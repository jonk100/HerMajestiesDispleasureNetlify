**Day's focus:** Primarily two of Paul's songs - "Let It Be" and "The Long And Winding Road"

**By session end:**
- Recorded best take of "Let It Be" up to that point
- Version of "The Long And Winding Road" recorded this day later included on "Anthology 3" (1996)
- Served as basic track for version released on "Let It Be" album

**Between rehearsals/recordings:**

- 12-minute jam of "Dig It" (50-second snippet included on Let It Be album)
- Cover versions: "Rip It Up," "Shake, Rattle and Roll," "Blue Suede Shoes" released as medley on "Anthology 3"

### Main Songs Recorded

#### Let It Be (Paul)

**This session:** Billy Preston due to be present
- Linda Eastman and daughter Heather present
- Heather actually playing hi-hat with Ringo during rehearsals

**Billy Preston late:**
- Paul enthusiastic about seeing how Billy's Hammond organ contributions would work
- George Martin filled in on organ for taped rehearsals this day

**George Martin's comment:** "It's very country and western in a way"

**John's response:** "Country and gospel, it is"

**Playback discussion (Get Back series):**
- John suggests: "Do that old gospel ending"
- George humorously counters: "We'll all kneel as we do it"

**Arrangement refinements:**
- Still began each rendition with "the F bit" heard after second chorus
- Decided to repeat it twice this day
- **Before Take 10:** George Harrison's suggestion - "Maybe just have one chorus on the first time and two choruses on the second time"
- Paul: "Ok, I think that's good"

**Take 10 (Let It Be Anniversary editions):**
- Paul sings and plays bit of "Please Please Me" on piano before starting
- John exclaims: "That was daft, y'know!"
- When Paul kept delaying, John humorously complained: "C'mon, I only get two notes in this song!"
- Performance comes across well
- George Martin's organ part quite rudimentary (probably due to not having played it before this day)

**Lyrics status:** 28 rehearsals this day
- Paul still hadn't written lyrics to final set of verses
- After listening to playback from previous day: "I'll have to think of some more words. But that's all right, because if I do think of the right words then it'll tie it up"

**Amusing vocal ad libs:**
- "You will be a good girl, let it be / and though you may be told off, you will still be able to see / that there must be an answer, let it be"
- While Paul instructing Ringo to "play it lighter" during conclusion, George adlibs third verse: "Somewhere in the heaven there he sees a man call Babragi / singing words of wisdom, let it be"
- Immediately followed by John: "Somewhere out in Weybridge there's a cat who's name is Pavagi / singing words of wisdom, let it B, H, I, J, K"
- Paul later repeats John's lyric but changes cat's name to "Banagy," continuing: "There will be the answer, let it be / and in my darkest hour, she is..."
- George interrupting: "...sitting on the lavatory" (causing John to repeat phrase while laughing)

**Billy Preston arrival:**
- Paul asked him to play "the F bit" like Bach
- After demonstration impressed everyone, Paul retorted: "Oh, look, that's all right. That'll do!"

#### The Long And Winding Road (Paul)

**This session:** First day Beatles seriously worked on song

**Context:** Rock-and-roll songs pretty much perfected
- Paul thought to focus on ballads he'd been working on (including "Let It Be")
- All lyrics as we know them finally in place

**Rehearsal statistics:** 16 rehearsals this day
- Over hour of attention given to song

**Line-up:**
- Paul: Piano
- George: Gibson J-200 acoustic guitar run through Leslie speaker
- John: Fender Bass VI
- Ringo: Drums
- Billy Preston: Electric piano

**Learning process:**
- Took time for Paul to explain syncopated beats he wanted in second measure of each verse
- Ringo and George habitually coming back in too early
- Paul instructs: "No, no, you've got to wait a lot longer than that, 'cause if you syncopate it, it's like double syncopation"

**Performance quality:** Many quite dreadful
- All just getting acquainted with chords, starting to work out arrangement

**John's bass struggles:**
- Having hard time playing bass (not his usual instrument)
- No overdubs policy meant Paul on piano, so John needed to play bass
- Paul called out chords and sang "bomm, bomm, bomm" at times to demonstrate vocally what John needed to play
- John not happy song in E flat major - capo wouldn't fit on Fender VI bass
- "E flat? F*cking hell! All right. I'll just have to go hysterical" he joked

**Paul's instruction:** Don't play too many notes, only play on chord changes

**John's technique development:**
- Eventually fell upon habit of pulling up note on neck of bass in measures 6 and 8 of each verse
- Also during conclusion of song
- Decided to stick with this for remainder of month

**Tension relief - cha-cha version:**
- Latin-influenced version lasted around one-and-a-half minutes
- Portion featured in Let It Be movie and Get Back documentary series
- Paul calls halt: "All right lads, that's enough! We could go on all bloody day!"

**John getting the feel:**
- Begins to get feel for song on bass
- Appears to be mimicking Paul's vocal work

**Paul getting punchy:**
- Purposely goofing around on vocals by incorporating silly voices

**Ringo falls asleep:**
- After Paul gives instructions on how he wants Ringo to tinkle around on cymbals during verses (witnessed in Get Back series)
- Drummer leans back at drums and falls asleep as others continue rehearsing
- Paul responds: "There wouldn't be much drumming, would there?"
- Laid-back feel of drum-less song prompts Paul: "It sounds a bit like a, sort of, dance orchestra"
- As song continues, announces: "...and that slow foxtrot by Rita and Thomas Williams!"
- John chimes in: "Peter is wearing a dark sombrero and a beard"
- Paul adds: "The husband is wearing a crimling skirt which he made himself!"

**George's guitar issue (while Ringo sleeping):**
- George Martin inquired why George's guitar not heard very well and if playing proper chords
- George said chords probably not correct because couldn't hear himself
- Mal Evans brought over pick-up to attach to guitar body to boost volume
- Before attached, George holds pick-up to neck and pokes fun by singing Paul's melody line with exaggerated vibrato
- Makes George Martin explode with laughter

**After Ringo wakes:**
- Paul instructs Glyn Johns to properly record song
- Following couple false starts (one with producer interrupting beginning of take)
- Paul sings: "The long and winding road / yes, Glyn Johns? / what do you want?"
- Put in near perfect performance
- Linda Eastman and daughter Heather looking on

- "Shake, Rattle and Roll"
- "Blue Suede Shoes"
- Released as medley on "Anthology 3"

### Chronological Conversations

#### Conversation 1: Strings Discussion - Foreshadowing Phil Spector Controversy

**Context:** After recording last take of "The Long and Winding Road," Beatles gathered in control room to listen. Paul mentioned considering adding strings to track. **Notable for two reasons:** (1) Get Back sessions conceived with strict "no overdubs" rule, (2) When Phil Spector asked to produce album from Get Back sessions in 1970, he added strings to "The Long And Winding Road" - decision caused Paul's ire upon hearing Spector's version.

**George Martin:** "Paul's thinking of having strings anyway"

**George Harrison:** "Paul, are you gonna have strings?"

**Paul McCartney:** "Dunno"

**George Martin:** "George was saying that the piano and the electric piano tends to be doing the same thing"

**Paul McCartney:** "Yeah"

**George Harrison:** "Well, it's like – There's only parts where you can hear the electric piano properly, or the piano properly"

**Paul McCartney:** "Yes"

**George Harrison:** "Most of the time, you know, like, they mix together"

**George Martin:** "Like your Leslie guitar contributes too. I mean, it is a bit in the same range as the electric piano with that vibrato on"

**Paul McCartney:** "Yeah. I think it needs, like, a lot of, uh…"

**Ringo Starr:** "Cleaning"

**Paul McCartney:** "Cleaning, yeah"

**George Martin:** "Actually, the thing is, it's a nice feel to it, but it's rather like everything else we've done. And this particular song doesn't need that. It needs something a little more clinical"

**Paul McCartney:** "See, the only way I've ever heard it is, like, in my head, is, like, Ray Charles's band. I haven't really even listened to them"

**George Harrison:** "It would be nice with some brass just doing the sustaining chord thing"

**Paul McCartney:** "Yeah"

**George Martin:** "It's hardly Beatles mode… [...]"

**Paul McCartney:** "We were planning to do it anyway for a couple of numbers, just to have a bit of brass and bit of strings"
