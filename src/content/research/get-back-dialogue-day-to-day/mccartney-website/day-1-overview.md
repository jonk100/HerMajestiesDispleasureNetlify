## Day 1 Overview (January 2, 1969)

First day of "Get Back" sessions at Twickenham Film Studios. The Beatles returned to Twickenham the following day (January 3).

### Project Concept

**Original plan:**

- Cameras capturing both preparation and final show
- Hour of Beatles numbers, one after another, no guest stars
- Minimal filming outside concert performance venue
- Scheduled live show: January 18 or thereabouts (2-3 "audience shows")
- Simultaneous filming of rehearsal work for "Beatles At Work" documentary (separate from TV special, to be shown later, perhaps 10 years later)

**Venue considerations (still undecided):**
- Roundhouse in north London
- Old Roman theater in Sabratha, Libya (Tripoli)
- Old flour mill on Thames
- Dozen other alternatives in London and provinces
- Twickenham Film Studios: temporary rehearsal space/home base while searching

**Key personnel:**
- Director: Michael Lindsay-Hogg
- Producer: Denis O'Dell (Apple Films)
- Engineer/Producer: Glyn Johns
- Producer (non-producing capacity): George Martin

**12:30 PM:** Paul arrives (delayed by public transport)
- Came by underground, local train, then taxi from Hampton Court station

### Main Songs Rehearsed

#### Don't Let Me Down (John)
- **First track rehearsed this day**
- 15 versions total
- **Early work:** John and George alone, then Ringo joined while waiting for Paul
- **George's reaction:** "That's a good one…I like simple tunes"
- **John's assessment:** "That's the most finished"

**Paul's re-arrangements after arrival:**
- Begin with title sung twice
- "Skip that little interlude" (the "I'm in love for the first time / please don't let me down" chorus conclusion)
- Said it "sounded like a middle eight so scrap that and use it somewhere near the end"

**John's experimental lyric:** Five repeats of phrase beginning "everybody got a..." (exercise of already developed idea with Paul for "I've Got A Feeling")

**Early lyric version:** Choruses concluded with "I'm in love for the first time / please don't let me down"

**Next session:** January 3

**Snippet included:** Beginning of "Fly On The Wall" disc (Let It Be...Naked, 2003)

#### I've Got A Feeling (Paul + John composite)
- 20 run-throughs
- **Most accomplished new song by day's end** (though still needed refining)
- **Structure:** Paul's composition blended with John's "Everybody Had A Hard Year"
- **Status:** Final structure already refined by this stage

**Paul's direction:**
- Called out chords for John and George
- Stopped performance to explain arrangement
- Switched from bass to acoustic guitar to demonstrate ideas
- Spent considerable time showing John descending guitar riff

**Vocal arrangements:**
- Vocal and harmony parts already in place
- Simultaneous lead vocals near conclusion already established

**John's humor:** Incorporated different lines like "everybody got a hard on"
- **Paul's counter:** "Everybody Had A Hard On Except For Me And My Monkey" (when George asked title)
- **John's title joke:** "I've Got A Hard On" (actual title: "I've Got A Feeling")

**Ringo's drumming:** Swing-style rhythm during ascending/descending triplet chords in instrumental sections

**Next session:** January 3

#### Two Of Us (Paul)
- 9 rehearsals
- **Working title:** "On My Way Home"
- **Lyrics:** All written at this time
- Frequent pauses for Paul to guide through chord progressions and time-signature changes

**Paul's instruction:**
- "It sort of, like, goes into a waltz, but you'll get the idea" (regarding "on our way home" segments)
- Good amount of instruction needed for time-signature changes
- John and George following on electric guitars, Ringo cautiously on drums

**Vocal arrangements explored:**
- Paul sang lead throughout initially
- George adding harmonies and slight lead guitar lines
- John eventually joined on vocals
- Paul suggested John sing lead with Paul harmonizing throughout
- Three-part harmonies suggested in places (later dropped)

**Discarded idea:** "Lightning middle-eight" 
- Second bridge occurrence running through "you and I have memories..." lyrics twice as fast
- Paul asked others' opinion, eventually omitted

**Paul's humorous demo:** Repeatedly sang "Two of us, Henry Cooper" (British heavyweight boxer) to demonstrate vocal line emphasis

**Progression:** Paul switched to bass toward end as chord changes became ingrained

**Next sessions:** Played once on January 3, worked extensively on January 6

#### Dig A Pony (John)
- **Title at this point:** "All I Want Is You"
- Solo demo by John to George before Paul and Ringo arrived
- John performed solo rendition on electric guitar
- Practically made it through to end with much of lyrics already in place
- **George's clarification:** "dig a pony?" / John: "yeah, dig A pony"

**Early lyric variation:** "I kill a hound dog" at beginning of one verse (held over to later rehearsals)

**George's contribution:** Some lead guitar contributions prompting John's "that's right"

**Status:** Most lyrics already finalized

**Next session:** January 7

#### Sun King (John)
- 5 run-throughs
- First introduction in studio

**Next sessions:** 
- 4 more takes on January 3
- One quick version on January 10
- Revisited July 1969 for Abbey Road album

### Atmosphere & Concerns

**George's complaint:** Acoustics of film studio terrible

**Paul's defense of Twickenham:**
- Referenced "Hey Jude" and "Revolution" promotional films shot there few months before
- Cited "Yer Blues" recorded in "little room like a bog" with great results despite poor acoustics
- "This place sounds terrible now, but it may just be great, you never know"

**Overall mood:** 
- Uncertainty about venue and dates
- John and George lukewarm about rehearsing in vast, cavernous soundstage
- Conversations about outdoor performance or smaller venue without firm conclusions
- General aim: recapture spontaneity of playing live

**Day's focus:** Three main new songs emerged as central to project
- "Don't Let Me Down"
- "I've Got A Feeling"
- "Two Of Us"

### Chronological Conversations

#### Conversation 1: Venue & Acoustics Discussion

**Context:** Discussion about rehearsal space quality at Twickenham and considerations for final performance venue.

**George Martin:** "All you need is, really, a good acoustic place to be in"

**George Martin:** "I like the idea of working with a big PA though, because it will trigger off something. It'd be like doing a live performance"

**Paul McCartney:** "Which this isn't... Nobody is, sort of, definitely struck on this place. George was saying before, it's not good acoustically"

**Paul McCartney:** "We did 'Yer Blues' in there" [referencing small room success]

**Paul McCartney:** "We'll be alright, it's just... Just play it, we'll just play it. We'll move out of here in a couple of days. Or maybe we won't..."

**Michael Lindsay-Hogg:** "My real feeling is that the venue itself ought to be quite good, as opposed to shabby"

**Dennis O'Dell:** [offers small soundproof stage available to look at - filming "The Magic Christian" starring Peter Sellers and Ringo; has Twickenham under contract till end of May]

**Michael Lindsay-Hogg:** "I just feel if we could get a spectacular venue, we'd gain rather than lose"

#### Conversation 2: Live Performance Location Debate - Open Air & Libya Proposal

**Context:** Extended discussion about potential venues including outdoor performance and exotic locations.

**Paul McCartney:** "The thing I don't want is like, a TV show sound. They always seem to have that sort of farty, little sound on TV shows"

**Glyn Johns:** "Well, don't forget you're hearing it on a TV speaker, which is a grotty speaker"

**Glyn Johns:** "The thing is that an open-air sound is fantastic. I've always wanted to do something in the open air"

**Paul McCartney:** "It'd be nice to try and find some way to do it out of doors"

**Glyn Johns:** "It's so bloody cold"

**Michael Lindsay-Hogg:** "It's your English rain which is worrying about outdoors in this country"

**Paul McCartney:** "Snow or rain will do me. You know, wind and anything. Make all that, it's just a frozen hand trying to play those notes"

**Paul McCartney:** "I wouldn't mind playing in the rain..."

**Paul McCartney:** "It's all right. You might just have a few deaths on the set due to electric shocks"

**Glyn Johns:** [laughing] "Yes, you could"

**Michael Lindsay-Hogg:** "I was very taken by the place Denis talked about, the amphitheatre [in Sabratha, Libya]. Because the whole thing... I could see torch-lit, two thousand Arabs, and friends around. And I thought the venue was appropriate"

**Paul McCartney:** "I think you'll find we are not going abroad, 'cos Ringo just said he doesn't want to go abroad and he put his foot down"

**Michael Lindsay-Hogg:** "I think the thing to do is just see what we all feel in a day or two as opposed to making anything hard and fast immediately. 'Cos we may find the idea – or any idea – grows and gets more attractive or less attractive given where you are now"
