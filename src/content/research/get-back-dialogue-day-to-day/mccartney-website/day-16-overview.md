## Day 16 Overview (January 25, 1969)

Sixteenth day of "Get Back" sessions - **fifth day at Apple Studios, crucial day when rooftop concert proposed and accepted.** Beatles returned to Apple Studio the following day (January 26).

### Overall Atmosphere

**Session began:** Glyn Johns playing mixes he created following previous day's recordings

**Billy Preston absent:** Doing TV show all day
- Allowed band to focus on three songs not requiring keyboard contributions: "Two Of Us," "Let It Be," "For You Blue"

**Day characterized by:** Blend of relaxed rehearsals and recording attempts
- "Two Of Us" and "Let It Be" - neither reached finalized take
- **"For You Blue" - given more attention, successfully captured solid version (Take 7)**

**Playful moments:**
- "Two Of Us" - John and Paul experimented with exaggerated accents and silly sound effects
- Other highlights: "I Lost My Little Girl" (Paul's earliest composition, John on lead vocals in nearly 10-minute, two-chord rock arrangement)
- George introduced "Isn't It A Pity" (later on All Things Must Pass) and "Window, Window" (played with Paul and Ringo)

**Live show discussions:**
- January 22: Band considered performing at Primrose Hill
- January 23: Further discussions about timing and logistics
- This day: Idea ultimately dropped for unknown reasons
- Time constraints: Glyn Johns preparing to leave for honeymoon
- No alternative idea left, frustrated Paul

**ROOFTOP CONCERT PROPOSAL:**
- During session, Glyn Johns and Michael Lindsay-Hogg suggested to Paul band could perform on rooftop of Apple building
- Around lunchtime: Paul, Ringo, Glyn Johns, Michael Lindsay-Hogg, and others made way to rooftop to assess practicality
- **Live performance on rooftop tentatively scheduled for Wednesday, January 29** (date ultimately changed to January 30)

### Main Songs Recorded

#### Two Of Us (Paul)

**This session:** 7 run-throughs in relaxed way

**Before rehearsals:** Ran through excellent harmonized rendition of 1957 Everly Brothers hit "Bye Bye Love"

**After working on bridge harmonies:**
- Idea dropped quickly
- Sometimes took on exaggerated German, French, Scottish or Jamaican accents
- Other times impersonated Bob Dylan or Peter Sellers' Inspector Clouseau ("...on our way hame / we're going hame!")
- Incorporated humorous vocal sound effects like rolling "r"s

**Confidence level:** Had song well rehearsed by this time
- Somewhat confident in officially recorded takes from previous day
- Blowing off steam by having fun
- **Old John and Paul camaraderie was back** - something they hadn't enjoyed throughout entire White Album experience

#### For You Blue (George)

**This session:** Worked on in earnest
- Referred to as "George's Blues (Because You're Sweet And Lovely)" at time

**Glyn Johns' proposal:** Beatles should perfect one song at time
- Record each whenever felt confident, then move on to next
- Felt good about recordings already made for "Get Back" and "Two Of Us"
- George suggesting these be released as next Beatles single
- Next song to tackle: "For You Blue"
- **Beatles now on a roll**

**Line-up:**
- George: Gibson J-200 acoustic guitar and vocals
- Paul: Piano (in Billy Preston's absence)
- Ringo: Drums with brushes
- John: Recently acquired Hofner Electric Hawaiian lap-steel guitar ("Hawaiian Standard"), tuned to D7 chord, played proficiently with slide and without pick

**Rehearsal statistics:** 28 run-throughs total, 13 recorded

**George's intention:** "The main thing with this, in my head, is it's influenced by those old fellas, you know, where nothing was professional at all, so it's really just, like, a one-take wonder. But we may have a four-take wonder!"

**Mood:** Work on "For Your Blue" lifted mood of band considerably

**Take 1 (Anthology 3, 1996):**
- Paul on piano instead of George's acoustic guitar
- Others join shortly thereafter
- Impressive performance
- Paul playing piano in straightforward bluesy style covering bass notes (no bass guitar)
- Only one verse used for solo (John's slide guitar focal point)
- George inadvertently ends singing: "I love you more each moment I'm with you"
- John concluding rather awkwardly, causing him to chuckle

**Take 2 onward:**
- George decided to include four-measure acoustic guitar intro
- Explaining to John: "OK, just make it one on each"
- Decision made to lengthen song: second solo verse added after John's (Paul showcased on piano)
- George's guitar intro extended to five measures (additional measure added at end)

**Take 3:**
- George forgets to allow Paul solo verse, begins singing
- John shouts "Piano!"
- George sheepishly recites: "I've loved that piano from the moment that I saw you"

**Take 6:**
- Used for Apple studio performance in Let It Be movie
- Ringo progressed to using sticks instead of brushes
- Paul relinquished traditional bluesy piano style for quirky chording on higher keys
- Leaving bass tones to John on lap steel guitar
- George asked for "bad honky tonk piano" sound
- McCartney intertwined paper between piano strings
- Effect clearly heard on released recording

**Take 7:**
- George performing guitar intro but Paul forgot fifth measure, came in early - replied "Just as well"
- After someone rattles ice in drinking glass, George tries twice more to get intro done correctly but fails
- After John humorously yells "QUIET PLEASE," George nails intro
- **Beatles perform near flawless rendition**
- **This version appealed to all**
- Being perfectionists, decided to record five more renditions in case could do better

**Take 9:**
- Quite good
- Solo section used in Let It Be movie as backdrop to all four Beatles arriving individually at Apple Building
- Segment cuts to group performing Take 6

**Take 12:**
- Excellent performance showing clearly enjoying recording process
- To introduce Paul's solo verse, George says "Mr. Bluthner" (reference to Bluthner grand piano he was playing)
- During solo, John yells "Yes, Jim" expressing approval
- All congratulate themselves for possibly best rendition yet
- George: "It felt nice!"
- John joked about slide guitar work: "A few genuine Jimmy Reed slips there! Sometimes you just pull the guitar like that" (Jimmy Reed = American blues musician, songwriter, fellow Vee-Jay Records label-mate)

**Final decision:**
- After playback of Take 6 and Take 12, George Martin suggested editing best parts of both
- George Harrison objected - felt Take 6 best overall by itself
- Wanted to continue "honest" recording policy for project
- **Take 6 recorded this day = first officially recorded song of Get Back/Let It Be project to appear on released album**
- Albeit with newer vocals recorded at later date

#### Let It Be (Paul)

**This session:** 18 run-throughs to reacquaint band with arrangement
- Even though Billy Preston not present
- Maybe get acceptable proper recording before leaving for day
- **Process wasn't all fun and games**

**Early run-throughs:** Showed either forgotten parts or just weren't into it
- **John apparently not remembering song's existence at all**
- Asked whether he'd rehearsed song with group earlier
- George reminded him he played bass
- John: "Bass?! I'm getting like Brian Jones in this group! You just give me the instrument, Paul, and I'll give you something!"
- (Brian Jones known for playing many instruments other than guitar on Rolling Stones recordings, played saxophone on "You Know My Name (Look Up The Number)")
- John's bass playing full of flubs
- Ringo's drum part not perfected
- John and George's backing vocals erratic and too loud

**George's question:** "Paul, How does it start?"

**Paul's reply:** "I don't know"

**George's response:** "So just straight in at the first verse as an intro?"

**Decided:** Begin song with "F bit"

**Paul's exhortation:** "OK, you watch us, we're gonna do this now. Ok boy, now, come on. Pull yourselves together!"

**John's reply:** "You talkin' to me?"

**George's response:** Began impromptu rendition of Chuck Berry's "I'm Talking About You"

**Paul squashed it:** "Come on now, back to the drudgery"

**John angrily:** "It's you that's bloody making it like this!"

**Paul sarcastically:** "The real meaning of Christmas" before beginning another rendition

**Next few rehearsals:** Very mediocre

**Atmosphere became silly - proposed lyrics for unwritten third verse:**
- George: "Captain Marvel comes to me"
- John: "Bloody Mary comes to me"
- Art dealer Robert Fraser stops in during session
- Paul sings: "And here's to Robert Fraser..."
- John continues: "...from his gallery!"
- During piano intro, John: "I'd especially like to thank you for all the birthday presents" (recollection of Christmas message recordings Beatles made to fans)

**Paul's decision:** Think positive, instructed Glyn Johns to properly record next take
- "This here's gonna knock you out"

**Anthology 3 version (1996):**
- Excellent rendition
- Great piano and vocal work from Paul
- Lyrics in final verses yet to be written
- Ringo stopped playing during final verses but otherwise subdued, adequate performance
- John and George's backing "aaah"s done well
- George's lead guitar solo goaded on by Paul with appropriate "yeah" during opening measure
- Composer adds couple exclamations of "let it be" during final chords
- Paul well pleased with outcome

**After this take:**
- Went through song few more times
- Including fast rock 'n' roll version
- Lack of interest and low energy - half-hearted at best
- Paul asks: "Can we carry this on tomorrow?" - ends session for day

#### Other Songs

**I Lost My Little Girl (Paul):** One of Paul's earliest compositions
- John on lead vocals
- Nearly 10-minute, two-chord rock arrangement

**Isn't It A Pity (George):** Introduced
- Later appeared on All Things Must Pass album

**Window, Window (George):** Previously performed solo during Get Back sessions
- Played with Paul and Ringo this occasion

**Bye Bye Love (Everly Brothers cover):** Excellent harmonized rendition before "Two Of Us" rehearsals

### Chronological Conversations

#### Conversation 1: Billy Preston Absent

**Glyn Johns:** "Is Billy coming today"

**George Harrison:** "No, he's doing a TV show, all day"

---

#### Conversation 2: India Trip Home Movies

**Context:** Early in session, Paul mentioned he'd edited together home movies from Beatles' India trip (Feb/March 1968) studying transcendental meditation with Maharishi. Told others he'd watched finished film previous evening.

**George Harrison:** "What were we doing?"

**Paul McCartney:** "We, uh… I don't really know, you know? But it's like we totally, sort of, put our own personalities under, for the sake of it. And you can really see, you know, we're all…"

**John Lennon:** "Who's writing all them songs?"

**Paul McCartney:** "That was probably when we did…"

**John Lennon:** "In your room"

**Paul McCartney:** "Yeah. Right. I remember, yeah. But just sort of… There's a…"

**George Harrison:** "Do you regret having gone there?"

**Paul McCartney:** "No, no. Oh, no. I just think, what we did there, we weren't really very truthful there. You know, things like sneaking behind [The Maharishi's] back and sort of saying, 'It's a bit like school, isn't it?' But you can see on the film that it is very like school"

**John Lennon:** "You want to call it 'What We Did On Our Holidays'?"

**Paul McCartney:** "But it is very like that. There's a long shot of you, sort of, walking with him. And it's just not you, you know?"

---

#### Conversation 3: Planning Week Ahead - Glyn's Honeymoon

**Context:** Conversation shifted to planning for week ahead before Glyn Johns departed for honeymoon.

**Glyn Johns:** "What we could do is get one number done, right? Ready for… do it. Film it and do it, right? And then move on to the next one, get that one ready, finish it, do it"

**Mal Evans:** "Starting now, you mean?"

**Glyn Johns:** "Starting whenever, yeah"

**George Harrison:** "Have we got to have this album recorded by Tuesday then? Is that the idea? We're just gonna record them all until we've got them all before Tuesday when Glyn goes? Is that it?"

**Glyn Johns:** "I'll now go on Thursday, in fact"

**Paul McCartney:** "I thought the idea was to get 'em all known by Tuesday"

**George Harrison:** "So Wednesday night, we've recorded…"

**Glyn Johns:** "I've gotta mix… I'd like to mix 'em before I go too…"

**George Harrison:** "Are we still doing the show?"

**Paul McCartney:** "I don't know, really"

**John Lennon:** "Say we did eight or nine, he'll come back after about a week or something. That's if we don't get 14 done by Tuesday"

#### Conversation 4: Live Show Feasibility - Paul's Frustration (EXTENSIVE)

**Context:** Discussed feasibility of still doing live show. Conversation took tense turn for Paul, who expressed frustration other Beatles lacked enthusiasm for live performance (though John insisted he'd be on board, suggesting George and Ringo weren't interested). Paul voiced concerns about unstructured nature of project, lamenting evolving from TV show into film without being shot in 35mm (would compromise professional quality). Criticized lack of clear climax for envisioned film, initially intended to culminate in live performance.

**Michael Lindsay-Hogg:** "Originally, it was a show and an album. A live album recorded when the show was actually live on the spot. And what I think is lacking at the moment is the show"

**John Lennon:** "I would dig to play onstage, you know? I mean, if it was all… everything was all right and there was no messing and we're just gonna play onstage. You know, that's why I said yes to the TV show. I didn't want the hell of doing it, but nobody else wants to go on the stage or do a TV show. You know, that's what it's about. Nobody wants to get out there. You know?"

**Paul McCartney:** "I suppose that's true, you know?"

**John Lennon:** "I think so, you know? I'm only going by what's happened"

**Paul McCartney:** "Yeah, yeah"

**John Lennon:** "What are you trying to make a show out of now?"

**Paul McCartney:** "I can't answer it, you know?"

**John Lennon:** "I know. I know that there's no sort of answer for it, but…"

**George Harrison:** "The things that have worked out best ever for us haven't really been planned any more than this has. It's just, you know, it's like you just go into something and it does it itself. You know, whatever it's gonna be, it becomes that, you know?"

**John Lennon:** "See, it's turned out it's not what Paul wants. It's like if it's… Say it's his number, this whole show. It's actually turned into our number more than his number. That's all. And, uh… It's just that, really"

**Paul McCartney:** "Yeah, I know, it is majority decisions and all. Yeah"

**John Lennon:** "We're presuming that we are gonna make this LP anyway as one whole piece, like as if the cameras aren't here. But it might be an idea to sort of face 'em… For the singing. The point of doing it all in one go is that we're aware of the camera. So we should look at the camera. And we sing it straight to 'em. You know? And… The finale'd just be us doing the numbers well… What do you think?"

**Glyn Johns:** "The main thing is to do the change from the acoustic numbers to the electric numbers"

**John Lennon:** "I mean, if we're doing a stage show, we'd have to… 'Hold on a sec, ladies and gentlemen, George just getting on his Rickenbacker.'"

**Glyn Johns:** "As far as I'm concerned, I would need one run-through on each number to get the balance set for it, 'cause it's all… everything's changing"

**John Lennon:** "We'll know that better as soon as we've got an order… Soon as we've got a story"

**Paul McCartney:** "It's all right, but I'd meant to sort of put the songs to some other framework this time. That's what I'd sort of thought. That we'd just keep to the same environment, totally… always, you know? We don't ever attempt to break out of it. We… We're in a recording studio again in London making another album, you know?"

**George Harrison:** "I think this is the nicest place I've been for a long time, this studio"

**Paul McCartney:** "Yeah, it is"

**George Harrison:** "No, really, you know, I mean. And also we've played… This is the most I've ever played by playing every day. And I can just feel myself getting… My fingers getting loose a bit. But really I just want to play. That's what it was about"

**Glyn Johns:** "What we've got is you all playing live in one room. That in itself is a fresh thing for The Beatles"

**Paul McCartney:** "Mmm"

**Michael Lindsay-Hogg:** "Are you gonna just stay around in a circle?"

**John Lennon:** "Unless we felt like standing up 'cause it was a shouter, you know?"

**Michael Lindsay-Hogg:** "No matter what we do, it's still gonna look like you're sitting in a room making the album. It's not per se a show"

**John Lennon:** "All we've got is us, and the documentary, where we happen to be singing. I mean, you see what happens when we're just grooving to the music. The whole place changes"

**Paul McCartney:** "Yeah, that's true"

**John Lennon:** "And that… If we're doing them well on the day, without anything… it should come over. We've gotta do it, you know?"

**Michael Lindsay-Hogg:** "And also, remember, the original idea was a TV show and then a documentary about it. And now it's changed to being a movie"

**Paul McCartney:** "It's like, really, if we're gonna do a film for cinema, it should've been done on 35 millimeters, which is just the best quality. We shot this on 16 because it's a television thing"

**John Lennon:** "Just the still photos would make a UA movie with soundtrack on it, you know?"

**George Harrison:** "I think we should blow it up to 35 and if they don't take it, they're fucking fools. Because they're not gonna get anything else, are they?"

**Paul McCartney:** "Unless we've got incredible quality on this, 16 blown to 35 is a mess"

**George Harrison:** "No, it's not. There's a certain stock that blows up better"

**John Lennon:** "Ektachrome 500"

**Michael Lindsay-Hogg:** "Yeah, this will blow up all right, this film"

**Paul McCartney:** "I don't know what it is that I'm moaning about, but it's just sort of…"

**Glyn Johns:** "I must admit I can't really see it either, because it's… It just seems the last two days everything's gone so ridiculously well"

**John Lennon:** "He's right, you know"

**(Various people together):** "It is good. It's going great. It really is something. It's true though"

**Paul McCartney:** "I just have a feeling that we… It's all right, you know? It's nothing to complain about, but… But it's just funny to sort of realize that after this is all over, you'll be off in a black bag somewhere on the Albert Hall, you know?"

**John Lennon:** "Yeah"

**Michael Lindsay-Hogg:** "What you're moaning about is there's no payoff"

**Paul McCartney:** "I think all I wanna do is, like, uh… I probably, you know, having got it together, I probably just wanna go and have fun with it. Rather than just, sort of, finish off exactly as we started. And I'd like to sort of do a… for the finish. And we just get out in the open, change of scene, and go and do it somewhere else, do it on a live show, do it on a stage. You know, I'd like to light a rocket and really sort of take off for the end of it. And, uh, you know… but that's going a bit, like, overboard, I suppose. But that's me, you know? I always do that"

#### Conversation 5: Rooftop Concert Proposal

**Context:** Later in session, Michael Lindsay-Hogg and Glyn Johns proposed idea that could give Paul live performance he was hoping for: Beatles could perform on rooftop of Apple building. Around lunchtime, Paul, Ringo, Glyn Johns, Michael Lindsay-Hogg, and others made way to rooftop to assess feasibility.

**Michael Lindsay-Hogg:** "The only thing is we've got to get some permission, Paul. So the cops don't come and throw us off, that's all"

**Ringo Starr:** "What happens if we go on top of the other roof?"

**Michael Lindsay-Hogg:** "If it's somebody else's roof, then we can get had not only for disturbing the peace and the noise, but also for trespassing"

**Mal Evans:** "Now, um, good. So, but just roughly timewise, so I can look into gear…"

**Paul McCartney:** "Yeah. So, okay, look, if we say like on Friday or something"

---

### Glyn Johns & Michael Lindsay-Hogg on Rooftop Idea

**Glyn Johns (Sound Man memoir, 2014):**
"A couple of days later we were all having lunch on the third floor. Ringo and I were in conversation about the building and its attributes and he asked me if I had ever been up on the roof, saying it had a wonderful view of the West End of London. So he took me and Michael Lindsay-Hogg up there, showing us a large area of flat roof with wonderful views of the city stretching away to the southwest. I suggested that if they wanted to play to a large crowd, why not play on the roof to the whole of the West End. We went back downstairs and put it to the others, and after some discussion, it was agreed. As the Savile Row police station was only a couple of hundred yards away we knew the concert would probably not last long, but the police stopping it would all be part of the fun"

**Michael Lindsay-Hogg (Rolling Stone, Nov 2, 2021):**
"In your recollection, playing on the roof was your idea, right?

I figured it was my job to say we need a place we're going to, we need a place to end, we need a conclusion. And that's when I said, 'Why don't we do it on the roof?' Because I thought that was part of my job, to offer them choices. Because it wasn't that they lacked ideas or imagination. God, no. But you had to help focus them because they had a million other things to do, including making an album"

#### Conversation 6: Scheduling Rooftop Concert

**Context:** Back in studio, conversation resulted in decision to tentatively schedule rooftop concert for Wednesday, January 29, 1969 (date ultimately changed to January 30).

**Michael Lindsay-Hogg:** "I think the thing is we'll aim for Thursday"

**George Harrison:** "Are we gonna do it all here now?"

**George Martin:** "I think you should aim for a little earlier than Thursday. 'Cause if you aim for Thursday, it's not gonna be Thursday"

**Paul McCartney:** "See, we have to give them a chance to get their other cameras in"

**Michael Lindsay-Hogg / Ringo Starr:** "Aim for Wednesday"

**Paul McCartney:** "It'll be pretty quick, but it'll still give us some time to do it"
