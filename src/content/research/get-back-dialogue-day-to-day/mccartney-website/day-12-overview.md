### Chronological Conversations

#### Conversation 1: Morning - Daily Sketch Article Discussion (Before Paul Arrived)

**Context:** January 16, 1969, Daily Sketch published article by Michael Housego, headlined "The End of a Beautiful Friendship?", mentioning alleged fight between John and George. At beginning of session, Beatles (minus Paul who hadn't arrived yet) and their team commented on article and its inaccuracies.

**Tony Richmond (Director of photography, reading article):** "Drugs, divorce and a slipping image"

**George Harrison:** "And it says, 'But it wasn't the first time they've traded a few punches'"

**John Lennon:** [stands up and mimics giving punches to George] "There's only one guy I'd like to get, and that's Housego"

**Glyn Johns:** "It's really extraordinary, the last week's press, isn't it?"

**George:** "Because there's nothing to it except that it's a lie"

**John:** "Hope it doesn't come out about me beating up Maharishi"

**George:** "No doubt Derek will have read it before it got in there and has sent them their telegrams and things"

**John:** "Congratulating them"

**John to Derek Taylor:** "See Michael Housego today? Don't you think it's suable?"

**Derek:** "No"

**John:** "What about the fisticuffs?"

**George:** "Yeah, none of that"

**Derek:** "He said it didn't take place, right?"

**George:** "He said it did"

**Ringo:** "He said 'might have'"

**John:** "Yes. In the past, well, that's false too. It's never got to that, except for a plate of dinner in Hamburg"

#### Conversation 2: Later - Paul Reads Article Aloud

**Context:** Later in session, Paul read extracts from article into microphone while other Beatles jammed in background.

### Daily Sketch Article Excerpts

**Full headline:** "The End Of A Beautiful Friendship?" by Michael Housego (January 16, 1969)

**Key claims:**
- "The awful tension of being locked up in each other's lives snapped the other night at a TV rehearsal and Beatles John and George swung, at very least, a few vicious phrases at each other"
- "On one occasion for certain they traded a few punches"
- "Drugs, divorce and a slipping image played desperately on their minds"
- "George Harrison told me a couple of days ago – a very bitter Harrison by the way – that 'the world wants us to take a tumble'"
- "The activities of John Lennon and his Japanese girl friend Yoko Ono are in the public domain and it has not helped the others to rebuild the team as a friendly foursome"
- "Paul has been sheltering from the headlines in an attempt to preserve some of his image and a friend told me that John's shenanigans have greatly displeased him"
- "As a friendly foursome, tied irrevocably to each other's pigtails, it's all over. They will never be exactly the same again"

### Daily Express Response (January 16, 1969)

**Denials from Beatles:**
- "Beatles John Lennon and George Harrison did NOT have a punch-up"
- "Apple – their business company – is NOT on any financial rocks"
- After five-hour meeting at Apple's Savile Row headquarters

**George Harrison:** "Apple has plenty of money – we all have. When John said we were losing money, he was talking about giving too much away to charities. We have been too generous and that's got to stop. The so-called punch-up between John and myself? There's no truth in it. We are still good friends"

**John Lennon:** "Any rumours about Apple folding were nonsense" / "There will be changes and it's all going to be very exciting"

**Ringo Starr:** "A load of old rubbish! I was there when it was supposed to have taken place. It's quite untrue"

**Paul McCartney:** "There was nothing sinister about tonight. It was simply a business discussion"
