## Day 15 Overview (January 24, 1969)

Fifteenth day of "Get Back" sessions - **fourth day at Apple Studios, varied day with recording debuts.** Beatles continued rehearsing over weekend, returned to Apple Studio following day (Saturday, January 25), which began with Glyn Johns playing back results of his overnight mixes.

### Overall Atmosphere

**Billy Preston's absence:**
- Rehearsed TV show appearance
- Absence shifted band's focus away from refining "Get Back"
- Arrived late afternoon

**Day's focus:** Concentrated on "Two of Us"
- Initially attempted electric arrangement reminiscent of earlier Twickenham sessions
- Ultimately settled on acoustic, folk-rock approach
- Still in rehearsal phase
- Glyn Johns preserved several takes on multi-track tape

**Recording debuts:**
- Paul's "Teddy Boy" (written in India previous year, briefly played January 9)
- John's improvisational "Dig It" (blues-rock piece with ad-libbed lyrics)

**Day rich in variety:**
- Paul experimenting with unreleased compositions: "Every Night," "Hot As Sun"
- Paul played "There You Are, Eddie" (written previous December for Beatles biographer Hunter Davies)
- John played "Polythene Pam" (only time during these sessions)
- John revisited two Quarrymen-era songs: "Maggie Mae," "Fancy My Chances With You"

**George Harrison's work:** Minimal
- Limited to unreleased "Window, Window"
- Revisited on subsequent days but never saw official release

**Billy Preston's late arrival:**
- Band returned to "Get Back"
- Session ran late, progress limited
- Deferred serious work on track for few days

**Evening activity:**
- Glyn Johns headed to Olympic Sound Studios
- Spent part of night mixing tracks recorded over past few days

**Weekend decision:** Beatles decided to continue rehearsing over weekend

**Glyn Johns reflection on "Teddy Boy":**
"I loved [Teddy Boy], and I was hoping they'd finish it and do it, because I thought it was really good. But my version does go on a bit, and they're just going round and round, trying to get the chord sequence right, I suppose, and the best bit is where John Lennon gets bored – he obviously doesn't want to play it any more, and starts doing his interjections"

### Main Songs Recorded

#### Two Of Us (Paul)

**This session:** Beatles decided on acoustic guitar arrangement (as we've come to know it)
- Witnessed in Peter Jackson's 2021 "Get Back" series

**Electric arrangement discussion:**
- John: "I don't know, it's just we're all very stiff…but when I hear Stevie Wonder (doing it), I don't know what his backing would be, but then you'd sing it looser (demonstrates), maybe it's just soft"

**Switch to acoustic:**
- John and Paul both switch to acoustic guitars
- Paul: "I'd like not to be playing bass on these ones because it's so silly, 'cause I wrote them on guitar, y'know, and it's just a bit like 'Peggy Sue'"
- Ringo follows suggestion by switching to tom beats as heard on Buddy Holly classic

**Bass discussion:**
- George: "It's a drag when there's no bass"
- Paul: "I quite like those ones where there isn't bass. We've done a few, (like) 'I'll Follow The Sun.' They've all tended to be that kind, but they're nice, y'know. They lose a big bottom, you know, but they gain a slim, lithe look"
- While Paul saying this, George begins composing bass guitar melody line on Rosewood Telecaster

**Rehearsal statistics:** 21 run-throughs this day
- Only 3 officially recorded
- Headphones not used - PA speakers utilized for them to hear themselves (resulting in occasional feedback)

**Notable takes:**
- First try prompting John to sing "Desmond had a barrow…" from "Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da"
- Another attempt vocalized as "You and me, PTA, Harp Bazaar" (inspired by hit "Harper Valley PTA" and magazine "Harper's Bazaar")

**George's response after recordings:** "It sounds lovely, that, now, after all the anguish we went through with it…Put it on the b-side (of 'Get Back')"

**John's reply:** "Release it in Italy only…Let's just make a different single for every country"

**First recording (Anthology 3, 1996):**
- Features opening mumblings about John playing introductory three-note figure on guitar at designated places
- John: "OK, what is there…you'll hear it, yeah"
- Paul: "Just the first occasion you get"
- John: "I did with my thumb"
- Just before third verse, Paul exclaims to John: "Take it Phil" (reference to Everly Brothers-like arrangement)

**Second complete version (Let It Be Anniversary editions):**
- John occasionally singing with American twang in voice
- "I was Phil Dylan in that one" he joked afterward

**Final complete version (Glyn Johns' first "Get Back" album):**
- Closes with Paul's statement: "And so we leave the little town of London, England" (reference to him and Linda's long drives to "get lost")

#### Maggie Mae (Traditional, arranged Lennon-McCartney-Harrison-Starkey)

**This session:** Three versions during "Two Of Us" rehearsals
- John leading group through favorite from Quarrymen days (skiffle song)
- Both John and Paul on acoustic guitars
- George on newly-acquired Rosewood Fender Telecaster
- Ringo on drums
- Natural to break tension - John played song on acoustic guitar using banjo chords back in skiffle days

**First ad-lib rendition:** Nearly minute long
- Two choruses and one verse
- Not remembering lyrics after "Two pound ten a week, that was my pay"
- After flubbing through remainder of bridge, repeated chorus second time
- Paul exclaiming "take it, Maggie!" before segueing into "Fancy My Chances With You" (early Lennon-McCartney composition never developed into Beatles song)
- Edited version (excluding bridge) featured on "Fly On The Wall" bonus disc (Let It Be...Naked 2003) and 2021 Anniversary editions

**Second version:** Just over 10 seconds between later "Two Of Us" takes

**Third version (39 seconds):**
- Glyn Johns rolling tapes intending to capture acceptable "Two Of Us" performance
- John started off "Maggie Mae" once again
- Slightly slower version allowing song to breathe more than Vipers Skiffle Group version
- Wisely fell apart precisely at point where John forgot words
- Captured on eight-track tape
- John and Paul sang in appropriately strong 'scouse' accent
- **Later included on "Let It Be" album**

#### Dig It (Lennon-McCartney-Harrison-Starkey)

**This session:** Four versions - came into being for first time

**Development:**
- After extensive work on "Get Back" and "Two Of Us," group started running through long list of covers
- "Maggie Mae," "Diggin' My Potatoes" and other Lonnie Donegan songs
- Moved into Guy Mitchell songs like "Singing The Blues"
- John playing Hofner Hawaiian Standard lap-steel guitar with slide (as eventually played on "For You Blue")
- **First day instrument used by Beatles**

**Initial experiments:**
- While sitting in front of lap-steel, John progressed into ad-lib jam
- Lyrically possibly inspired by "Diggin' My Potatoes" and/or "Can you dig it?" catch phrase of time
- Lennon repeatedly sang variations of phrase
- Paul joined in on vocals
- Exchanged lines: "I can dig it," "everybody dig it," etc.

**Four-minute jam version:**
- After two brief experiments, John developed idea further into 12-bar blues progression using lap-steel
- All four Beatles playing
- Continued "can you dig it" lyrical theme
- Lennon claims you can "dig it every morning" and "dig it every evening"
- Demands "I want some insurance, I need a guarantee"
- Paul comically imitates remote location DJ: "Coming to you from the heart of Chicago's blues land, Blind Lame Lennon!" (reprising similar interjection from unreleased 1967 "You Know My Name (Look Up The Number)")
- John's slide guitar getting wild towards end
- Paul sings: "I think you're out of tune, boy"
- Clearly Beatles enjoying themselves

**Version with Billy Preston (nearly five minutes):**
- After Billy arrived later that day
- Decided to run through experiment one more time with keyboardist
- **At conclusion, John stated in high voice:** "That was 'Can You Dig It' by Georgie Wood. And now we'd like to do 'Hark, The Angels Come'" then performed brief falsetto vocalization
- **This statement later edited into both film and soundtrack album**
- Two-minute edit of performance appeared in some 2021 Anniversary "Let It Be" album editions

#### Teddy Boy (Paul)

**This session:** Recording debut
- Written in India previous year
- Briefly played January 9
- Version later edited with recordings from January 28 for "Anthology 3"
- Included in early mixes of "Get Back" album

#### Get Back (Paul)

**This session:** 21 run-throughs total
- Some performed before Billy Preston's mid-afternoon arrival

**Notable versions:**
- One where John missed cue to begin first guitar solo - Paul exclaims: "Yeah…or should I say 'No'"
- Another started at very rapid pace, developed into medley with "Little Demon" (Screamin' Jay Hawkins) and three Chuck Berry songs: "Maybelene," "You Can't Catch Me," "Brown Eyed Handsome Man"

**New development:** Inclusion of coda after song's conclusion
- Experimenting with reprises of different lengths
- Some renditions show back-to-back versions with many spirited vocal improvisations from Paul

**Final version of day:**

### Chronological Conversations

#### Conversation 1: Book Idea Discussion

**Context:** John discussed idea of accompanying future album with book of photographs. When "Let It Be" released in 1970, concept came to fruition as special limited edition that included 164-page book featuring collection of images and dialogue from sessions.

**John Lennon:** "Did you hear about the book idea?"

**Paul McCartney:** "Yeah"

**John Lennon:** "They're great, man. Really great. It'll be a book of the film. They can have it out almost simultaneously. The book of the film, the book of the… All that. The package is great"

**Paul McCartney:** "It's good"

**John Lennon:** "They'll have slides, you know. And I'll talk to John Kosh on Monday. 'Cause I think he'd be a nice guy to design it"

#### Conversation 2: Billy Preston Contract & "Fifth Beatle" Discussion

**Context:** Topic of discussion was Billy Preston's contract for participation in recordings. John even suggested inviting Billy to join band permanently, effectively becoming "fifth Beatle." However, Paul not enthusiastic about idea, responding half-jokingly: "It's just bad enough with four."

**John Lennon:** "Did you tell Paul we've got Billy a contract?"

**George Harrison:** "No, not yet"

**John Lennon:** "We've got him off Capitol. Just like that. And George will produce him"

**Paul McCartney:** "I was just talking to him about that. I said, 'What did you do after Hamburg and that?' He said, 'Well, I saw you guys go, sort of, 'voomph' to the moon'. And he sort of had a couple groups together. But he's never, sort of, done his thing"

**George Harrison:** "The main thing, Billy just really is so knocked out, so thrilled doing it. And also he sees it's his great opportunity"

**Paul McCartney:** "Then he puts his name and The Beatles. Like, it's Billy Preston!"

**George Harrison:** "I didn't think about it. We'll have to decide about paying him. 'Cause, if we were having Nicky Hopkins playing, we'd have to pay him session musician rates. Which will be…"

**John Lennon:** "This is, like, to be in the film and that"

**Paul McCartney:** "Yeah, we'll just say to Ron, 'Look, will you talk to Billy?'"

**John Lennon:** "On the film it happened so great. I mean, I'd just like him in our band, actually. I'd like a fifth Beatle. At Twickenham, suddenly, there was three, now there's four of us, then there's five!"

**George Harrison:** "We can do that, as well. If I asked Dylan to join The Beatles, and he would, as well, you know, and we get 'em all in here!"

**Paul McCartney:** "Yeah, but they don't need to join The Beatles"

**John Lennon:** "We'd call it The Beatles & Co. That'll be our band"

**George Harrison:** "I mean, it's Sergeant Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, innit?"

**John Lennon:** "We could get 'em all"

**Paul McCartney:** "I just don't, because it's just bad enough with four"
