## Day 7 Overview (January 10, 1969)

Seventh day of "Get Back" sessions at Twickenham Film Studios. **George Harrison quit The Beatles after lunch.** The four Beatles reconvened two days later (January 12) for scheduled meeting.

### Overall Atmosphere

**Morning session:**
- Paul first to arrive (as often at Twickenham)
- Spent time chatting with music publisher Dick James about Northern Songs' purchase of Lawrence Wright Music catalogue (collection of classic songs)
- Afterward, sat at piano, played solo performances: "The Long and Winding Road," "Let It Be," "Don't Let Me Down," "Maxwell's Silver Hammer," "I've Got a Feeling," "Get Back"
- As rest of Beatles gradually arrived, morning spent working primarily on "Get Back" with some attention to "Two of Us"

**After lunch break:**
- Tensions flared
- Argument between George Harrison and John Lennon escalated
- **George walked out of session and quit The Beatles**

**Context of tensions:**
- Days leading up: tensions also surfaced between George and Paul
- Most notably January 6: frustrated George told Paul "I'll play whatever you want me to play. Or I won't play at all if you don't want me to play. Now, whatever it is that will please you, I'll do it"
- Echoed Ringo's temporary exit August 1968, but this time fractures more pronounced

**Remaining three Beatles' response:**
- Mix of denial or unwillingness to confront situation (especially with cameras rolling)
- Carried on as if nothing had happened
- Mix of defiance and catharsis

**John's sarcastic reactions:**
- Called out "OK George, take it!" as if expecting him to return
- Yoko now seated on George's blue cushion, took center stage
- Wailed wordless vocals over series of raw, blues-based jams

**Band's frustration spilled into performances:**
- "I've Got a Feeling" and "Don't Let Me Down" played with aggressive edge
- John screamed through "Don't Let Me Down"
- Offbeat moment: John sang "Maxwell's Silver Hammer" in exaggerated German accent

**Paul returned to piano:**
- Yoko continued vocal improvisations, seemingly oblivious to tension

**John's conversation with Michael Lindsay-Hogg:**
- Session tapes captured discussion suggesting if George didn't return within few days, Eric Clapton could take his place

**Freeform jamming:**
- Three Beatles engaged in more jams
- Paul switched to drums
- John on guitar
- Ringo delivering improvised spoken-word lines

**Session end:** After few hours of aimless musical outburst, session ended early

### George Harrison's Accounts

**From Beatles Anthology (2000):**
"They were filming us having a row. It never came to blows, but I thought, 'What's the point of this? I'm quite capable of being relatively happy on my own and I'm not able to be happy in this situation. I'm getting out of here.' Everybody had gone through that. Ringo had left at one point. I know John wanted out. It was a very, very difficult, stressful time, and being filmed having a row as well was terrible. I got up and I thought, 'I'm not doing this any more. I'm out of here.' So I got my guitar and went home and that afternoon wrote 'Wah-Wah'.

It became stifling, so that although this new album was supposed to break away from that type of recording (we were going back to playing live) it was still very much that kind of situation where he already had in his mind what he wanted. Paul wanted nobody to play on his songs until he decided how it should go. For me it was like: 'What am I doing here? This is painful!'

Then superimposed on top of that was Yoko, and there were negative vibes at that time. John and Yoko were out on a limb. I don't think he wanted much to be hanging out with us, and I think Yoko was pushing him out of the band, inasmuch as she didn't want him hanging out with us.

It's important to state that a lot of water has gone under the bridge and that, as we talk now, everybody's good friends and we have a better understanding of the past. But talking about what was happening at that time, you can see it was strange"

**From Keith Badman 'Off the Record' (2008):**
"That period was the low of all time. In normal circumstances, I had not let his attitude bother me and, to get a peaceful life, I had always let him have his own way, even when this meant that songs, which I had composed, were not being recorded. In front of the cameras, as we were actually being filmed, Paul started to get at me about the way I was playing. Everybody had left at one time or another, but I left during Let It Be. When I left, there's a scene where Paul and I are having an argument and we're trying to cover it up. Then, the next scene, I'm not there and Yoko's just screaming, doing her screeching number. Well, that's where I had left, and I went home and wrote 'Wah Wah'. It'd given me a wah-wah, like I had such a headache with that whole argument. It was such a headache"

**George's diary entry for January 10:**
"January 10. Got up. Went to Twickenham. Rehearsed until lunchtime. Left The Beatles. Went home"

### Other Beatles' Perspectives

**Ringo Starr (Keith Badman 'Off the Record' 2008):**
"George had to leave because he thought Paul was dominating him. Well, he was because Michael Lindsay-Hogg liked Paul, I would think, more than the rest of us. So, it's like Paul's film, actually"

**George Martin (Keith Badman 'Off the Record' 2008):**
"In order to get things together, Paul would organise everyone and be rather bossy, which the other boys didn't like. But, it was the only way of getting it together. John would drift away with Yoko and George would say he wouldn't be coming in the following day. It was general disenchantment"

### Michael Lindsay-Hogg's Account

**From memoir "Luck and Circumstance" (2011):**
"At Twickenham, The Beatles, Yoko, and I, often joined by our cameraman Tony Richmond, would have a proper lunch in the small dining room up a flight of stairs, adjoining a bar where some crew members and studio office workers would be sinking their couple of pints of beer before going off to their own lunch…

George was usually with us, joining in the conversation, affable and friendly and interested in the give-and-take, but on the day of the Tunisian discussion, he wasn't with us as the meal started. At the morning rehearsal, I could tell by his silence and withdrawal that something was simmering inside him, and so in my role as documentarian, I'd asked our soundman to bug the flower pot on the lunch table.

We'd finished the first course when George arrived to stand at the end of the table.

We looked at him as he stood silent for a moment.

'See you 'round the clubs,' he said.

That was his good-bye. He left.

John, a person who reacted aggressively to provocation, immediately said, 'Let's get in Eric [Clapton]. He's just as good and not such a headache.'

Paul and Ringo would not be drawn in, and after lunch we went back to the studio where Paul, John, and Ringo improvised a ferocious riff, half an hour of anger and frustration expressed with guitars and drums. Yoko sat on the edge of the rostrum on the blue cushion which had been George's and howled into his mike.

(My bug had only picked up the sounds of cutlery banging on china plates, obscuring what the muffled voices had said.)"

**From Rolling Stone interview (November 2, 2021):**
"Well, I didn't have a key piece of information, which Peter now has. We used to have lunch together every day in the little commissary in Twickenham, and I got our sound guy to bug the flowerpot. George wasn't there at the beginning of the lunch, and then he came up and stood at the long end of the table. He's wearing this beautiful black corduroy hat, and he said, 'See you around the clubs.' Meaning, I'm off. And so I'll see you in the Scotch Club or the Ad Lib, but I'm gone [from the Beatles]. And John always reacted to provocation very quickly, and so he said, 'Oh, well, you know, let's get in Eric Clapton, he's not such a headache.' But when I played back the audio, all I got was the clatter of cutlery and plates and [inaudible] voices. Peter has access to this extraordinary new audio technology that can separate the audio within a track, and so he's got some of that lunch, I think"

### Chronological Conversations

#### Conversation 1: Morning - Dick James & Northern Songs Discussion

**Context:** Paul spoke with music publisher Dick James about Northern Songs' acquisition of Lawrence Wright Music catalogue. Paul made sarcastic remark when James suggested Northern Songs primarily owned by Paul and John - hinted at Paul's frustration over ownership of Beatles' catalog. This foreshadowed events two months later (March 1969) when Dick James sold his shares in Northern Songs to ATV without consulting Paul or John, resulting in them losing control of own publishing rights - point of contention for Paul in decades to come.

**Paul McCartney:** "'Lisp Of A Baby's Prayer'... 'Alphabet Song.' What's that one?"

**Dick James:** "Oh, Christ, I don't know the whole catalog yet. 4,000 songs is a lot to absorb"

**Ringo Starr:** "'Nobody Loves a Fairy When She's Forty'" [laughs]

**Paul McCartney:** "This is it? This is the lot?"

**Dick James:** "This is a very good list. That's the entire catalog up to '65"

**Paul McCartney:** "All of these are ours?"

**Dick James:** "Yeah. Yeah"

**Michael Lindsay-Hogg:** "Is this the catalog that's just gone on sale?"

**Dick James:** "It's the one we just bought"

**Michael Lindsay-Hogg:** "You bought it. Oh, great"

**Dick James:** "Yeah, Northern Songs... Which includes Paul and John. And..."

**Paul McCartney:** "Just about"

**Dick James:** "What are you talking about, 'Just about'?"

**Paul McCartney:** "Nothing. Uh, no comment"

**Dick James:** "Very substantially, sir"

**Paul McCartney:** "Yes, right. Okay"

**Context:** After lunch break, argument between George Harrison and John Lennon escalated, leading George to walk out of session and quit The Beatles.

**George Harrison:** "I think I'll be leaving the band now"

**John Lennon:** "When?"

**George Harrison:** "Now" [...] "Get a replacement. Write into the NME and get a few people"

**Mal Evans:** "I'll ask George (Martin) to see about paying residuals"

**George Harrison:** "But he shouldn't be bothered with that. You know, that's why we've got Apple, so that, you know, we attend to it ourselves"

**George's departure:** As George left Twickenham, told other Beatles: "See you 'round the clubs"

#### Conversation 3: Post-Departure - John & Paul Discuss "She Said She Said"

**Context:** Michael Lindsay-Hogg arranged clandestine recording of John and Paul discussing George's sudden departure. During conversation, they referenced 1966 song "She Said She Said," recalling how Paul had walked out of recording session after disagreement with John.

**John Lennon:** "Now the only regret about the past numbers is when, because I've been so frightened, I've allowed you to take it somewhere I didn't want..."

**Paul McCartney:** "Yeah"

**John Lennon:** "...and then my only chance was to let George take over, or interest George in it, because I knew he'd..."

**John Lennon:** "Just pretending nothing's happened"

---

#### Conversation 5: John & Michael Lindsay-Hogg - Eric Clapton Discussion

**Context:** After series of jams and performances, John spoke with Michael Lindsay-Hogg about band's next steps. During conversation, John suggested reaching out to Eric Clapton to take George's place if he didn't return.

**John Lennon:** "I think, if George doesn't come back by Monday or Tuesday, we'll ask Eric Clapton to play. Eric will be pleased ... He'd have enough scope to play the guitar. The point is, George leaves and do we want to carry on The Beatles? I certainly do"

**Michael Lindsay-Hogg:** "Maybe for the show, I mean, you could just say George was sick"

**John Lennon:** "No. I mean, if he leaves, he leaves"

**Michael Lindsay-Hogg:** "What's the consensus? Do you want to go on with the show and the work?"

**John Lennon:** "If he doesn't come back by Tuesday, we get Clapton"

**Michael Lindsay-Hogg:** "Has anyone ever left as seriously as George before?"

**John Lennon:** "Well... Ringo... We'll see how the weekend goes. There's a meeting"

**Michael:** "I don't know. I was going to say, if George comes back we go away [i.e. abroad, to do the show], and if Clapton comes in we stay here. But I think if... I still think we should go away"

**John Lennon:** "We should just go on, though, as if nothing's happened"

**Michael:** "I think we should go away"

---

#### Conversation 6: George Martin, Neil Aspinall & Michael Lindsay-Hogg - Why George Left

**Context:** While John, Paul and Ringo jammed, George Martin, Neil Aspinall and Michael Lindsay-Hogg discussed why George might have left.

**Michael Lindsay-Hogg:** "The trouble is, once you leave, it's very hard to come back"

**Neil Aspinall:** "Not really. We'll all have to meet him on Sunday, anyway. So he could be back, then. No, really, the box that George is in, it's him versus John and Paul when it comes to what they're gonna do and what they're gonna play. And you try doing that for a few months. You're going to end up pissed off"

**George Martin:** "Well, the songwriting. They're our songwriting team and he's his own team. And if he's not working on his own song..."

**Michael Lindsay-Hogg:** "Yes but, John and Paul aren't writing together much anymore, are they, really?"

**George Martin:** "No, but nevertheless, they're still a team"

**Michael Lindsay-Hogg:** "Yeah, 'cause it goes on the label that way"

---

#### Conversation 7: End of Session - What To Do Next

**Context:** Towards end of session, another group discussion touched on what to do next, without clear decision.

**John Lennon:** "So cats and kittens, what we gonna do?"

**Michael Lindsay-Hogg:** "Hey, I've just been having some groovy ideas. So what's our next move?"

**John Lennon:** "We split George's instruments"

**Michael Lindsay-Hogg:** "You know, I was an actor when I was a kid"

**Ringo:** "With Orson Welles"

**Michael Lindsay-Hogg:** "The thing about Orson is he's very funny. We were in Belfast, rehearsing the stage version of 'Chimes of Midnight.' And one day he walked off the stage"

**Glyn Johns:** "See you 'round the clubs" [using same sentence George Harrison used when leaving Twickenham]

**Michael Lindsay-Hogg:** "See you 'round the clubs! ... He came back an hour later" [...] "I just think we ought to have a good location"

**Paul McCartney:** "I think we should do it at The Cavern"

**Maureen Starkey:** "Yes!"

**George Martin:** "Location isn't really a main problem at the moment"

**Ringo:** "No"

**Paul McCartney:** "It's breathing, actually"

**Final moment:** Cameras captured brief conversation between John, Paul, and Ringo, all wearing their coats (audio not recorded). Two days later (January 12), they would reunite with George for scheduled meeting.
