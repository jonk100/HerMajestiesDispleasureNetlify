## Day 4 Overview (January 7, 1969)

Fourth day of "Get Back" sessions at Twickenham Studios. The Beatles returned to Twickenham the following day (January 8).

### Overall Atmosphere

**Tensions continue:**
- Unresolved issues from previous day (January 6) continued to simmer
- Paul and George engaged in lengthy discussions about group's direction
- John and Ringo remained mostly silent observers
- Strained atmosphere persisted throughout

**Morning session:**
- Extensive talking about band's problems
- Paul and George most vocal
- John and Ringo listening
- Discussions about potential split

**Despite tensions, significant musical developments:**
- First recorded performances of "Get Back," "The Long And Winding Road," "Golden Slumbers"
- Continued work on strong live performance candidates
- Various jam sessions and impromptu covers

### Main Songs Recorded

#### The Long And Winding Road (Paul)

**Background:**
- Paul began writing September 1968
- Reportedly recorded demo at time, gave to Alistair Taylor (Apple Corps general manager)
- First briefly played segment on January 3 (second day of rehearsals)

**This session:**
- Morning, before other Beatles arrived
- Paul sat at piano and played song
- Ran through for nearly 5 minutes
- Lyrics still incomplete: only first verse and "Many times I've been alone / And many times I've cried"

**Next session:** Formally introduced to bandmates on January 8

#### Golden Slumbers (Paul)

**First performance:** This day (January 7)

**Lyrics source:** Adapted from 17th-century poem by dramatist Thomas Dekker

**Status:** Version already quite close to one later released on Abbey Road

**Connection:** Linked to "Carry That Weight" (introduced previous day), mirroring how two tracks eventually paired on album

**Next session:** January 9

#### Get Back (Paul)

**Paul's quote from press release:**
"We were sitting in the studio and we made it up out of thin air… we started to write words there and then… when we finished it, we recorded it at Apple Studios and made it into a song to roller-coast by"

**Creation process:**
- Conceived this day in studio
- Melody emerged organically from unstructured jam session
- Gradually took shape as Paul improvised lyrics and chord progressions
- Cameras rolling during development

**Initial development:**
- Paul ad libbed vocalizations and chord changes
- George strummed open chords on electric guitar in solidarity
- Song started developing in Paul's mind while being filmed
- 3 more versions of embryonic "Get Back" worked out with George and Ringo

**Second run-through:**
- Paul: Bass and mumbled vocals
- George: Electric guitar
- Ringo: Singing with Paul on newly invented chorus "Get back, get back, get back to where you once belonged"
- **Inspiration:** Jackie Lomax's recently released single "Sour Milk Sea" on Paul's mind
- Lyrics beginning to form: "a woman, but she was another man," "it coming, but she gets it while she can"

**Further development:**
- George moved to electric guitar with wah-wah pedal
- Ringo on drums with standard rock beat
- Paul acknowledged Jackie Lomax inspiration: exclaimed "C'mon Jackie," attempted to imitate English vocalist during second chorus
- "She was another man" and "gets it while she can" lyrics solidified

**After John arrived:** Surprisingly, worked extensively on "I've Got A Feeling" and "Maxwell's Silver Hammer" instead despite high inspiration for new composition

**Next session:** January 9

#### I've Got A Feeling (Paul + John composite)

**Previous work:** January 2, 3, and 6

**This session:** 6 rehearsals
- Focus on refining vocals and tightening arrangement

**Paul's direction:**
- "We should start off by doing everything we're gonna do on the thing (concert)"
- "Like, the 'oh yeahs' in it, you've gotta do 'em how you're gonna do it, because there's no use singing 'em quiet now and planning to do 'em loud on the night"
- Instructed Ringo to keep 4/4 drum pattern during ascending/descending triplet chords instead of switching to swing beat

**Status:** Arrangement already solidified, emphasis on vocal refinement

**Next session:** January 8

#### Maxwell's Silver Hammer (Paul)

**Previous work:** January 3

**This session:** 18 run-throughs
- Working on arrangement throughout

**New element:** 
- At Paul's request, Mal Evans brought anvil and hammer
- Mal joined some rehearsals attempting to strike anvil on correct beats
- Portion of rehearsal with Mal struggling appears in "Let It Be" movie

**Arrangement ideas developed:**
- Whistle during certain segments (just before verses)
- George worked out vocal harmony for choruses

**Next session:** January 8

#### One After 909 (Lennon-McCartney)

**Previous work:** January 3 and 6

**This session:** 4 performances
- Further refining arrangement
- Becoming "the fun rocker that would eventually grace the Let It Be album"
- Paul and Ringo providing solid backing
- George providing guitar passages filling gaps between lyrical phrases

**Next session:** January 8

#### Across The Universe (John)

**Previous work:** Reintroduced to band on January 6

**This session:** 12 performances

**John's intentions:**
- "I think we can do it almost the same way, just better. Anyway, just even to do it because I think it's just a waste banishing it. I'd sooner stick it in here"
- Bemoans it's "another slow one – I know we'll knock off a couple of fast ones. If I just wasn't so tired when I got in"
- George assures him it's alright to contribute slower songs

**Lyric sheet incident:**
- John wasn't sure of lyrics previous day, requested set from Apple office
- "What's the first line?" he asked before sheet arrives
- When received from Eric Brown, reviews lyrics
- Questions own poetry: dumbfoundedly asks "tumble blindly??"

**Discussion of earlier recording:**
- John dissatisfied with previous results
- "When we were doing it last time, we did it alright in the end. The thing I don't like about the version we did, is we didn't dig it the time we did it. All that tamboura was great…Got your taboura, then?"
- George: "I liked those girls singing as well, which you didn't like. The whole record is great, really. It's just another idea, another way of doing it"
- John: "I haven't heard it in a long time"

**Rehearsals progression:**
- Song becoming somewhat tighter
- Attention waned after while, renditions started sounding lethargic
- John plays electric guitar, performing intro himself on earlier run-throughs (as on original recording)
- Sings all words perfectly thanks to lyric sheet
- Paul: Bass and harmonizing throughout verses, singing in unison during "nothing's gonna change my world" chorus sections
- **John's counter:** "I wish it f*cking would" on one version (possibly response to earlier disagreements)
- George: Electric guitar using wah-wah pedal, sometimes playing intro instead of John
- Ringo: Steady full drum pattern in verses, sometimes losing beat with time signature changes, stops at chorus beginning to highlight "nothing's gonna change" vocals, then focuses on toms for remainder of each chorus

**Next session:** January 9

#### Don't Let Me Down (John)

**Previous work:** Extensive rehearsals on January 6

**This session:** 12 versions
- Continuing to refine arrangement

**Next session:** January 8

#### She Came In Through The Bathroom Window (Paul)

**Previous work:** Introduced January 6

**This session:** 4 versions
- Group becoming increasingly familiar
- Paul introduced one take: "We know this one, don't we?"
- Rehearsals closely matched tempo of version recorded six months later for Abbey Road

**Next session:** January 8

#### Gimme Some Truth (John)

**Context:** Song John would later record for "Imagine" album in 1971

**This session:** Several versions led by John

### Chronological Conversations

#### Conversation 1: Morning Discussion - Venue Debate & Show Concept

**Paul McCartney:** "I mean, at the moment, we're just rehearsing the numbers for the show. None of us has had the idea of what the show is gonna be yet"

**Michael Lindsay-Hogg:** "One of the things wrong about doing the show here is it's too easy. Denis said, 'Come on, let's do it at Twickenham' and I think that's wrong. If we are doing it in the backyard, I think that's too easy. And that's why, I think, if you all have decided to do a show, then it should be the best show. Because you are The Beatles, you aren't four jerks"

**Paul McCartney:** "The only thing about that though is that we don't want to go away"

**Michael Lindsay-Hogg:** "Think of the lights in the water. Torch-lit. 2,000 Arabs. I mean, visually, it is fantastic"

**Paul McCartney:** "But we're not going away"

**Michael Lindsay-Hogg:** "My trouble is… I usually get talked over a good idea. I will, every day, say Tripoli and every day I get closer to the left fist"

**George Harrison:** "We could make it like requests"

**Paul McCartney:** "We should do the show in a place we're not allowed to do it. You know, like, we should trespass, go in, set up and then get moved and that should be the show. I mean, if you put us in the Houses of Parliament, playing in the main gallery at the Houses of Parliament, and getting forcibly ejected, still trying to play numbers and the police lifting you..."

**Michael Lindsay-Hogg:** "I think that's too much of an obstacle"

**Paul McCartney:** (Singing) "She came in through the bathroom window"

**Paul McCartney:** "Scuffling with the coppers, boots and truncheons and all that. You have to take a bit of violence"

**Michael Lindsay-Hogg:** "I think that's too dangerous… That is an interesting thought of you all being beaten up. You could go to Manila again"

**[George]:** "Manila or Memphis"

**Michael Lindsay-Hogg:** "What about a hospital? But I don't mean for really sick kids. I mean for kids with broken legs. I mean, really, kind of, 1944 Hollywood musical Bing Crosby kids"

**Paul McCartney:** "Or in a hospital, they can't all get up and walk. [laughs] Except for the finale"

**Michael Lindsay-Hogg:** "Oh, yes!"

**Paul McCartney:** "When John walks up to the little girl and says, 'Come here.' And she gets up and walks"

**Michael Lindsay-Hogg:** "Or maybe an orphans' home? An orphans' home. Children are the hope of the future department. What about an orphanage? How does that grab you guys? It's like, 'Going once, going twice, going three times and that's it'"

**Paul McCartney:** "No"

**Michael Lindsay-Hogg:** "Orphanage… Orphanage going downhill"

**[John]:** "I don't think that orphanages and police balls are gonna do it"

**Michael Lindsay-Hogg:** "What's the biggest charity in the world? I don't mean in terms of polio, but what's the most charitable thing anybody could do?"

**George Harrison:** "They say… Don't they say, 'Charity begins at home'?" [all laugh]

**Paul McCartney:** "So we'll do it at George's house" [all laugh]

#### Conversation 2: Purpose, Communication & Package Discussion

**John Lennon:** "I think we are just repeating all the dullness"

**Paul McCartney:** "We gotta have some serious reason for doing this or else we won't. What's it for? Can't be for the money"

**John Lennon:** "I've decided the whole point of it is communication. And to be on TV is communication. We've got a chance to smile at people, like 'All You Need Is Love.' So that's my incentive for doing it"

**Michael Lindsay-Hogg:** "If this comes off, we've got a great entertainment package. We've got an album, a documentary never seen before, and a performance. It's a great package"

**John Lennon:** "The worst that we have is a documentary of us making an LP, if we don't get into a show"

#### Conversation 3: Paul's Frustration - Lack of Support & Living in Past

**Paul McCartney:** "But we haven't played together, you see. That's the fucking thing. But when we do come together to play, we all just sort of talk about the fucking past! We're like old age pensioners. 'Remember the days when we used to rock?' You know, but we're here now, and we can do it, you know? But, I mean, all I want to see is enthusiasm! See, the thing is also I get to a bit where I just sort of push all my ideas. You know, I mean, a lot will come out of it if we could get the enthusiasm. I mean, why are you here? I'm here 'cause I wanna do a show. But I really don't feel an awful lot of support"

---

#### Conversation 4: George's Response - Doldrums & Repeating Patterns

**George Harrison:** "We keep coming up against that one and I keep saying, 'Yeah well, I'd like to do this, this and that.' And we end up doing something again that nobody really wants to do"

**Paul McCartney:** "If this one turns into that, it should definitely be the last for all of us. Because there just isn't any point"

**Michael Lindsay-Hogg:** "I think that'd be sad. I mean, as an audience. That'd be sad"

**Paul McCartney:** "Course it is! It's stupid. It is just stupid. You see, the people who are being stupid are the four of us"

**George Harrison:** "We need to be creative instead of being the doldrums, which it always is. The Beatles have been in doldrums for at least a year"

---

#### Conversation 5: Paul on Brian Epstein's Death & Lack of Discipline

**Paul McCartney:** "Ever since Mr. Epstein passed away, it's never been the same. I mean, we've been very negative since Mr. Epstein passed away. And that's why all of us, in turn, have been sick of the group. It's discipline we lack. We've never had discipline. We had a sort of slight, symbolic discipline. Like Mr. Epstein. You know, and he sort of said, 'Get suits on,' and we did. You know, and so we were always fighting that discipline a bit. There really is no one there now to say, 'Do it.' Whereas there always used to be. Daddy's gone away now, and we're on our own at the holiday camp. I think we either go home or we do it"

---

#### Conversation 6: Performance vs. Recording Group

**Michael Lindsay-Hogg:** "Do you still wanna perform in front of an audience, or do you just see yourselves as a recording group?"

**Paul McCartney:** "I think we've got a bit shy, I think I've got a bit shy of certain things, you know. 'Cause you know how often, like, on albums we sometimes blow one of your songs [talking to John], 'cause we come in in the wrong mood. And you say, 'This is how it goes. I'll be back.' And we're all just, 'Oh, well you…'"

**Michael Lindsay-Hogg:** "That's why we're wrong to throw away the show. Because there's no desire"

**Paul McCartney:** "So it's like, if we're doing the show, we're gonna have to work hard. And that means by the time a week from now comes all these songs we've got, we've gotta know perfectly"

---

#### Conversation 7: George's Frustration with His Songs

**George Harrison:** "I don't wanna do any of my songs on the show. Because they just turn out shitty…"

**Paul McCartney:** "No, but this… Thinking it's not gonna come out great won't help. If we cancel the show now, we'll be throwing it away"

**Michael Lindsay-Hogg:** "But equally, at the moment we haven't got a show and so none of us really want to do it"

**Paul McCartney:** "I'll do it. I'm not interested, you know, to spend my fucking days farting around here, while everyone makes up their minds whether they want to do it or not. It's like Mal said last night, 'If you're gonna do the show here, you've gotta decide today.' And as far as I can see, there's only two ways. We're gonna do it, or we're not gonna do it. And I want a decision!"

#### Conversation 8: "Maybe We Should Have a Divorce"

**George Harrison:** "Maybe we should have a divorce"

**Paul McCartney:** "Well, I said that at the last meeting. But it's getting nearer, you know?"

**John Lennon:** "Who'd have the children?"

**Paul McCartney:** "Dick James"

**John Lennon:** "Oh, yeah"
