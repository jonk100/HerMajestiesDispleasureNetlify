## Day 9 Overview (January 14, 1969)

Ninth day of "Get Back" sessions at Twickenham Film Studios. **Another low point - final Twickenham session.** Following day (January 15), four Beatles met again and agreed to accept George's demands to move sessions from Twickenham to Apple's headquarters in Savile Row, London.

### Chronological Conversations

#### Conversation 1: Morning - Absurdist Banter & Work Avoidance

**Context:** From 'a moral to this song' blog - Hard pressed to work on any new material, group (sans George) talk idly about Glyn Johns' ancestry, train sets unrelated production company preparing for film inside studio, plans for next day's sessions. John and Paul interview each other about non-existent projects, skirt issue of John's health, communicate in alternations of absurdity and obscurity. (Doug Sulpy describes tone of John's voice as having "interesting quality [...] as if, wanting to say something serious for a change, he's forgotten quite how".)

**John:** "Who's the fool on the hill, Paul?"

**Paul:** "John"

**John:** [long pause] "I'm trying to sell the house" [long pause] "When I was young, so much younger than today, I never needed anybody's help, in any way. But now my life has changed in oh so many ways. A-whop-bop-a-luma… a-lim-bam-boom" [long pause] "We should hold some sanctions against George. Very tightly"

**Paul:** "Wheat. Coal"

**John:** "Yes. Wheat and coal. Bread loaves. Meat biscuits. Cardboard cut-outs"

**Paul:** "You see the Thirty-Minute Theatre?"

**John:** "I did, but in a blue fuzz. But it didn't get through to me. Nice colour, though" [pause] "I had a visit from a hippie family. Wondered why I had so many bedrooms"

**Paul:** [long pause] "Were you able to tell them?"

**John:** "Oh, yeah. I told them I've got a lot of bedrooms because I've got too many. And I offered them accommodation in Ireland, which they took up"

**Paul:** [long pause] "Let's crack on" [sighs]

**Michael:** "Who's got a match, as opposed to a lighter?"

**Paul:** "I have"

**John:** "I have"

**Michael:** "As opposed to a lighter"

**Ringo:** "A wooden one?"

**Paul:** "Blue gold?"

**Michael:** "A wooden one do, a wooden one not do… thank you"

**Paul:** "I wooden wanna…"

**Michael:** "Are you [inaudible] John?"

**Glyn:** [laughs] "No, I am not related"

**Ringo:** "Stratford John?"

**Glyn:** "Nope"

**Paul:** "Farmer John?"

**Glyn:** "Augustus John, apparently"

**Michael:** "The John"

**Glyn:** "Rumour has it Augustus John is a grandfather twice removed or something" [laughs]

**Michael:** "That's the way with most of us offspring [inaudible]"

**Paul:** [referring to film equipment] "Is that the new trick, the playback speed is up there?"

**Ringo:** "They've been there for several years"

**Paul:** "Still feeding back" [laughs]

**Michael:** "Should we knock off early today or not?"

**Paul:** "Probably, yeah"

**Michael:** "Should we knock on early tomorrow?"

**John:** "Yes, I'll do that"

**Paul:** "Knock on early?"

**John:** "Yes, I just uh… was up late, you know"

**Paul:** "Yeah?"

**Michael:** "At the moment you're a guest for lunch"

**John:** "I was sort of stoned and high and watching films and I wouldn't have made it anyway. And uh…"

**Paul:** "Check up"

**John:** [subdued] "Yeah, but it's not good if – I'm gonna come at ten, I should come at ten, you know"

**Paul:** "Up with the dawn, down with the sun"

**John:** "Mm"

**Paul:** "Ringo ever, Eric never"

**Yoko:** [referring to previous night?] "It was worthwhile, though, wasn't it?"

**John:** "Oh, it was worthwhile" [Paul and Yoko laugh]

**Paul:** "Does he make a lot of fun of you, Yoko?"

**Yoko:** "Not enough" [laughs]

**Paul:** "Not enough" [John laughs]

**Michael:** "I think they're painting the train. They'll be doing that while – whilst the time we're here"

**John:** "We'd better get on before it leaves, then"

**Paul:** "Please believe me. I'd hate to miss the train. Oh yeah" [pause] "Like the shoes?"

**Yoko:** "Is that the fashion?"

**Paul:** "This is the thing now, you know"

**Yoko:** "Mm"

**Paul:** "The next thing. The socks are – the socks are with them, they come with them"

**John:** "You did introduce oxford bogs, didn't you?" [Paul and Yoko laugh]

**Paul:** "Yeah, yeah. I am an innovator in many ways"

**John:** "Well, apart from your part-time work, what are you doing?"

**Paul:** "Well, I do a lot of dramatic work, in and out of the country"

**John:** "Presently, I'm working on a Welsh TV series called Land for Wecken, in which I appear as a Danish singer of royal blood who turned to folk singing after a disaster in the First World War where the Nazis bombed his house"

**Paul:** "Mm"

**John:** "And he had to move into, uh, Norway I think it was. Why, I was born on the train between Ostograd and Fensborough"

**Paul:** "Jamaica?"

**John:** "Sometimes" [Ringo laughs] "But generally I have a hell of a mi-graine. So I usually take uh, frantic, which usually gets rid of it. It dissolves in half the time, you see" [pause] "It gave me a great background for the job I'm doing now"

**Michael:** "It's funny – it's funny, really. The guy said to me, do you mind if they store their trains quietly in the back? And they've come totally populated with painters and the rest of them"

**John:** "Now, the one thing you find about – we're not pushy"

**Paul:** "No"

**John:** "People want to put trains in the middle of our set—"

**Paul:** "—they get it"

**John:** [inaudible]

**Paul:** [pause] "Yeah. Mind you, we're not mugs"

**John:** "Oh no"

**Paul:** "Oh no"

**John:** [referring to Apple] "We gave it all away. It was our plan"

#### Conversation 2: Two Virgins Discussion & Ringo Feeling Ill

**Context:** From 'a moral to this song' blog - As day trudges forth without productivity for Beatles' second day without George, Paul asks John about Two Virgins (under flippant guise of journalist) to which John responds with stiff sincerity. Michael Lindsay-Hogg comes round to confer, Ringo admits he isn't feeling well and wonders about having rest. Michael commiserates but expresses concern about impetus of group, worried they will individually (and indifferently) wander off to own devices if they don't have routine schedule to solder them together as working band - prompts John and Ringo to sing sentimental folk bar. Not being of disposition to have serious discussions about direction of sessions, John, Paul, and Ringo (dis)engage in frivolous wit and references to Laugh-In.

**Paul:** "So what's the point behind Two Virgins?" [Yoko laughs]

**John:** "It's a six-inch nail" [long pause] "The main point behind it is to open people's minds to what's happening today. There are people all over the country humming into tape recorders, and we hope to bring them out into the open. And hum together" [pause] "You understand?"

**Paul:** "Hmm"

**John:** "Now sold one thousand three hundred due to the great promotion from Apple Dietetics"

**Yoko:** [laughs] "Which is a figure you don't want to expose, necessarily"

**Paul:** "Is it very neat to do this in public, Mr. Lennon?"

**John:** "I feel obliged, in the position that I am today as a pop idol and the power I have, to do something for the good, and uh, I feel obliged to speak out…" [pause] "And that's as simple as I can put it, really. Take Downing Street. South Orderly Street. Wimpole Street. All owned by the Queen. 'Nuff said" [silence; fidgeting]

**Mal:** [in background] "Is anybody – wanna rehearse, or do songs, or—?"

**Yoko:** [inaudible]

**Ringo:** "I feel ill, actually"

**Michael:** "Do you? Was this a mistake [inaudible]?"

**Ringo:** "I don't" [laughter]

**John:** "I think a few days in bed…"

**Ringo:** "Yes, I think so too"

**John:** "Or maybe three days on the couch, depending on what your job is"

**Ringo:** "I think two days in bed"

**Michael:** "Do you really not feel well?"

**Ringo:** "No, I just feel a bit… ill"

**Paul:** [to Michael] "Well, do you?"

**Michael:** "I don't feel well, but I can't say, 'cause I'm the captain of the ship"

**John:** "Oh you can" [Yoko laughs]

**Paul:** "Why?"

**Michael:** "No, I don't want to let the crew down"

**John:** "Nowadays, the captain gets off first"

**Michael:** "No, I go down with the ship"

**Yoko:** [inaudible]

**John:** "No he does, really"

**Michael:** "I feel tired, but I think it's tiring – disappointing"

**John:** [bored] "Hmm"

**Michael:** "But I have a feeling if we decide not to meet one day, we may never meet again"

**Paul:** "Well…"

**John:** "Along this dusty road…"

**Ringo:** "We'll always meet again…"

**John:** "On this dusty road"

**Yoko:** "As they say, there's no business like no business"

**John:** "Again"

**Paul:** "Yeah"

**Yoko:** "Again"

**Paul:** "And still the boom [mic] wasn't over them"

**John:** "Ooh, the Queen of Sheba wore falsies"

**Ringo:** [mock-surprise] "I didn't know that!"

**John:** "Didn't you know that? You weren't there at the time" [pause] "Cleopatra was a carpet manufacturer"

**Ringo:** "I didn't know that!"

**John:** "'Cause you weren't there at the time" [pause] "Edgar Allen Poe was a shithouse"

**Ringo:** "I didn't know that!"

**Yoko:** "What was John Lennon?"

**John:** "A patriot" [Yoko laughs] "I didn't know that" [laughter]

**John & Paul:** "Goodnight, Dick" [laughter]

**John:** [sighs] "That was Lennon and McCartney. Northern Sheds. Great Western Railway"

**Paul:** "Songs for all functions"

**John:** "Ross-Upon-Wye"

**Paul:** "Nige-Whalley-Mange"

**John:** "Ilford two, Western Middlodeons – terrible"

#### Conversation 3: CBC Interview, Work Discussion & Bad Jokes

**Context:** From 'a moral to this song' blog - As Paul jokingly suggests camera crew capture Ringo (who isn't feeling well) if he sicks on floor, John mentions superficially that he threw up during interview filmed earlier in day with Yoko for Canadian television – not from illness, but from recent irresponsible habits, possibly exercised previous night. Paul, wearied by lethargy of proceedings, tries to engage John about recording sessions and how they should work while George is gone, but John palters, and at turns they both fall back on oblique references and emotionally indeterminate allusions. After John trades bad jokes with Ringo, Paul implores them to remember why they're here and that they can't idle forever, and John (seemingly contrite, if nonetheless facile) agrees to start rehearsing. Despite others' reservations about his health, subdued Ringo reassures he's staying to play too.

**Note:** During this period John was using heroin, which is most probable cause (directly or indirectly) for his vomiting.

**Ringo:** "Kevin?"

**Paul:** "I think if we hang around a bit longer we can get Ringo being sick" [laughter]

**John:** "You – see, you missed me this morning, I did it for CBS. Just leapt off in the middle of the interview"

**Paul:** "Did you?"

**Kevin:** [in background] "As a matter of fact, yes"

**John:** "No reason at all, except that I've been mistreating my body"

**Yoko:** "I thought it was a happening"

**John:** "It was a happening"

**Paul:** "There was a lot of nervous tension, you know"

**John:** "Oh, yes"

**Paul:** "I mean, there was a bloody funny atmosphere in that room, mother"

**John:** "Aye"

**Michael:** "We missed out on the other day"

**John:** "Hmm?"

**Michael:** "We missed it the other day, but then they wouldn't let us have it"

**John:** "They missed it too"

**Michael:** "Oh. Were they in colour or black and white?"

**Yoko:** "Colour"

**John:** "I never noticed that. Colour"

**Paul:** [trying] "See, what we need is a serious program of work. An endeavour. Not an aimless rambling amongst the canyons of your mind. [inaudible] —life"

**John:** "Take me on that trip upon that golden ship of shores… We're all together, boy"

**Paul:** "To wander aimlessly is very unswinging. Unhip"

**John:** "And when I touch you, I feel happy inside. I can't hide, I can't hide" [pause] "Ask me why, I'll say I love you"

**Paul:** "What we need is a schedule"

**John:** "A garden schedule"

**Paul:** "Point A to Z. Travel to A to Z, and having reached the point – take a holiday"

**John:** "It's holiday time"

**Paul:** "Achieve something, everyday" [pause]

**Yoko:** "It's a hell of a lot to ask for…"

**John:** "That's sort of hard to live up to, Paul"

**Paul:** [very quiet] "It's very hard to live up to"

**Michael:** "Ernest Hemingway had a very good remark about that, which I've unfortunately forgotten. About achieving something everyday. It's the only thing of his writings I like"

**Paul:** "It may in theory sound silly, but—"

**John:** "In practice…"

**Paul:** "—it's even sillier. Well, if practice is all there is"

**John:** "This is where it's at"

**Paul:** "This is where it's at, unless that is where it's at"

**John:** "This is where it's at, now"

**Paul:** "Mm-hmm" [long pause] "Teamwork. A good defense. And a line of forwards. A good strong pair of boots"

**Yoko:** [inaudible]

**John:** "You play ball with me, and I'll play ball with you"

**Paul:** "Don't swing the lead, sonny"

**John:** "Every cloud have a silver mouth boat"

**Paul:** "Could be learning something instead of this, you know"

**John:** "Bob Newridges is a tartan that covers Yorkshire"

**Paul:** "Rutland is the smallest county"

**John:** "Scarborough is a college scarf"

**Paul:** "Amo amas a minge"

**John:** [laughs] "Amanty meaty monkey monk…" [Paul laughs]

**Yoko:** [to Michael] "Are we going to see the rushes, or—?"

**Paul:** "This is the – this is the typical end-product of an actor's career"

**John:** "Alexander the Great was a bighead. Or a fireplace" [long pause] "Why do they call it Great Britain? How long is it going to go on? Fantastic France. Amazing America"

**Paul:** "Huge Spain"

**John:** [laughs] "Huge Spain. I'll drink to that" [pause] "When is a door not a door?"

**Ringo:** "I don't know"

**John:** "When it's ajar"

**Paul:** "When it's ajar"

**Ringo:** "Two flies on a door. Which one was sick?"

**John:** "I don't know"

**Ringo:** "The one on the panel"

**John:** "I don't blame it" [pause] "Why did the chickie cross the road?"

**Paul:** "You see what you've done to us, pal?"

**Ringo:** "To get to the other side"

**John:** "You've heard it before!"

**Ringo:** "Yes"

**John:** "Clichés…"

**Ringo:** "What goes over water, under water, and never gets wet?"

**John:** "Hmm… a rubber mac"

**Ringo:** "No, an egg in a duck's belly"

**Paul:** [cutting in] "Now, alright, we can't carry on like this indefinitely now, can we?"

**Ringo:** "I beg you?"

**Paul:** "We can't carry on like this indefinitely"

**John:** "Doing this?"

**Ringo:** "We seem to be"

**Paul:** "We seem to, but we can't. Because our hearts are—"

**John:** "Should we go play our group, then?"

**Paul:** "There's the other point"

**John:** "I think this is rather good"

**Paul:** "It's alright, I must say, but we can't carry on like this indefinitely"

**John:** "As some clips in between"

**Paul:** "Yeah"

**John:** [pause] "As I said, I'm just recovering from the day, you know…"

**Paul:** "Dyspepsia"

**Yoko:** "From the night, frankly"

**John:** [stage whisper] "Oh, don't say that, you're be revealings!"

**Yoko:** [laughs] "Oh… I didn't think about that"

**John:** "'From the night', indeed. Next thing you'll be telling them about our black sheets!" [laughter] "Enriched with Marylebone Station…" [fidgeting; gets up] "Right" [to Paul] "Guitars? I thought that's what they do"

**Paul:** "That is what they do, but if you're singing—"

**John:** "Oh, I'll even sing you half a song I was writing"

**Paul:** [gets up; to Ringo] "C'mon. Sounds. How's – how's about?"

**Ringo:** [subdued] "Sound city… Yes, go on, I'll come"

**Paul:** [concerned] "How are you feeling?"

**Ringo:** "No, I just feel a bit off. Very—"

**Paul:** [joking; bleak] "Last two years, actually"

**Ringo:** [laughs] "No, it's not that. It's just that some days— [inaudible; drowned out by voice marking slate] —you don't know how you feel"

#### Conversation 4: End of Day - Future Plans Discussion

**Context:** Michael Lindsay-Hogg asks about whether to continue rehearsing or move to EMI for album.

**Michael Lindsay-Hogg:** "We ought to figure out, do you wanna go on rehearsing? Or do you want to move into EMI and just maybe do an album?"

**John Lennon:** [referring to George] "Well, it all rests on when we see …"

**Paul McCartney:** "You see, the thing is, George is in Liverpool now and he's supposed to come back tomorrow"

**John Lennon:** "Tomorrow? So tomorrow we go and see him, you think? So, we don't go here or what? Or do we come here and then go down in the afternoon?"

**Paul McCartney:** "I don't know really. I think we stop filming now, as a matter of policy. That's a wrap for you, lads"
