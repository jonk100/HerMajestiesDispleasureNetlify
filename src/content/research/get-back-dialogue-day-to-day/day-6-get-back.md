### Overview

January 10th, 1969: Following an (unrecorded) argument with John in the Twickenham Film Studios lunch room, George returns to the studio floor and announces he’s leaving The Beatles. He then drives out of London to Liverpool, where he writes ‘Wah Wah’.

### Dialogue

GEORGE: —I think I’ll be leaving the band now.

JOHN: When?

GEORGE: Now. [audio cuts off]

### Notes

The walkout itself is almost shockingly brief in the audio; the weight comes from context and everything that follows.

### Overview

With George gone, George Martin, Neil Aspinall, and Michael Lindsay-Hogg discuss why. They highlight the Lennon–McCartney partnership as an entrenched “team” that leaves George isolated as “his own team.”

### Dialogue

MICHAEL: The trouble is, once you leave, it’s very hard to come back.

NEIL: Not really. We’ll all have to meet him on Sunday, anyway. So he could be back, then. No, really, the box that George is in is, um – it’s him versus John and Paul when it comes to what he’s got to do and what he has to play.

GEORGE M.: And there’s the songwriting. Because they’re a songwriting team, and he’s – he’s his own team. And [inaudible] it’s tough. 

MICHAEL: Yes, but – John and Paul aren’t writing together much anymore, are they, really?

GEORGE M.: No, but nevertheless, they’re still a team. 

### Notes

Neatly articulates George’s “box”: still structurally outside the Lennon–McCartney axis even as that axis is itself fraying.

### Overview

While Paul plays Barber’s ‘Adagio for Strings’ in the background, Michael, Glyn, and Mal chat about touring war stories. John and Ringo join in, talking about hotels, tours, and having eggs thrown at the band in Australia.

### Dialogue

JOHN: [American accent] Oh yes. Why, I think of it every day. I think what fun we had, when we was The Beatles, playing and rocking, with the group around the world. I said, “Richard, you remember that?” And he says, “No, I hadn’t joined you then.” [laughter]

RINGO: The hotels, I have very fond memories of.

JOHN: [laughs] Yeah.

RINGO: The tour, I’m not so fond of.

JOHN: Having eggs thrown at us in Australia was one of my big moments.

RINGO: I was away for a long time with tonsilitis. [laughs]

JOHN: Ah, yes.

MICHAEL: Who went out instead?

RINGO: Bobby Nicol, Jimmie Nicol?

MICHAEL: Jimmie Nicol?

JOHN: Jimmie Nicol, who is now making a living as the twenty-ninth Beatle in New Mexico. [Michael laughs]

### Notes

Nostalgic and jokey, but also underscores the split between fond memories (hotels) and trauma/exhaustion (tours).

### Overview

Later that day, with George gone, Paul, Ringo, Maureen, Mal, Neil, George Martin, and Michael fall into extended knock-knock jokes and absurd “where should we play?” fantasies. John and Yoko re-enter while papers are being read; Paul makes a pointed “Mersey Beat Couple of the Year / Irritant of the Year” joke about them.

### Dialogue

GEORGE M.: Oh I do like to be beside the seaside…

MICHAEL: So at the moment, how’s America looking? Where’s, uh—

RINGO: America doesn’t… it isn’t nice at all.

MICHAEL: Doesn’t look nice at all. [pause] Where’s he gone?

GEORGE M.: John?

MICHAEL: Four-eyes.

RINGO: He’s most probably off painting somewhere.

PAUL: [snorts] Yeah, yeah. Sketching.

MICHAEL: Sketching, or writing a quick poem. Or a book. Or a diary.

PAUL: Probably in a bag in his dressing room with Yoko, you know. [general laughter] They brought their own bag with ‘em today.

MICHAEL: Hence the expression…

GEORGE M.: “Papa’s got a—“

MICHAEL & GEORGE M.: “—brand new bag.”

GEORGE M.: Snap.

MICHAEL: Snap. [laughs] “Papa’s got a brand new bag-snap.” Or a zip. So, uh… [long pause] The seven men are going out to Africa on Monday, right? [uproarious laughter] We’ve got a reconnaissance team.

PAUL: Seven Zulus going to Willesden on Monday. [laughter] To check it out.

MICHAEL: No, we keep adding all the time.

PAUL: Or Paddington Town Hall.

RINGO: A special hired jet Boeing 707 is taking a full haul to Constaninopole. To see what the weather’s like.

MICHAEL: [laughs] And the show will be done in Ethiopia.

RINGO: That’s a nice place. Did someone say that before?

MICHAEL: Ethiopia? Oh, that’s my joke! Do you remember my joke of Haile Selassie?

GEORGE M.: The Abyssinian?

RINGO: Isn’t he Brazilian?

MICHAEL: No, no – the punchline is “Haile Selassie”.

RINGO: Then what’s the bit before?

MICHAEL: And the bit before is, “Do you want to buy my tomatoes?” Do you want to buy my – it’s a queer Moroccan joke which I made up.

RINGO: “Do you want to buy my tomatoes?” “Haile Selassie.” [laughs]

PAUL: Very good joke.

GEORGE M.: Did you tell it to anyone here? Have we heard it yet?

MICHAEL: Well, some of them heard it on the first day, and rejected it. “Haile Selassie.” See, I thought it was a kind of nice rough trade, New York joke. “Haile Selassie.” But it goes through a list of things you would sell for money. [laughter] I find this very funny! I—

RINGO: Do you want to buy my potatoes?

MICHAEL: No.

RINGO: Princess Margaret. [Michael laughs]

PAUL: [inaudible]

RINGO: Knock knock.

MICHAEL: Who’s there?

RINGO: Charlie.

MICHAEL: Charlie who?

RINGO: Elizabeth Harden. [long pause; general laughter]

MICHAEL: I love knock-knocks. We were going to do one for the [Rock ‘n’ Roll] Circus, we were gonna have “Knock knock, who’s there?” and someone was gonna say, “That’s right.” And then, “What do you mean, ‘That’s right?’”

RINGO: [in background; to Maureen] I stole it from you, my dear, I know that. [Maureen laughs]

PAUL: [laughs] I don’t get it!

RINGO: What?

PAUL: “Charlie Elizabeth Harden”? [general laughter]

MICHAEL: The “who”, the “who” is there.

MAL: [laughs] That’s what you do!

RINGO: “Michael.” “Michael who?” “Bill and Ben.” [general laughter]

MICHAEL: I love knock-knocks.

GEORGE M.: I like the song ones.

MICHAEL: Who’s there?

GEORGE M.: Knock knock.

RINGO: Arthur. Is that?

MICHAEL: Is that who?

RINGO: Is that your Cornetto? [Michael laughs]

MICHAEL: Hiawatha.

RINGO: Hiawatha who?

MICHAEL: Hiawatha good little boy till I met you.

GEORGE M.: Knock knock.

MICHAEL: Who’s there?

GEORGE M.: It is Simon.

MICHAEL: Simon who?

GEORGE M.: Simon chanting evening… [general laughter]

PAUL: [to John and Yoko?; Cockney accent] Get in your bag! Get in here boy and get in your bloody bag! Go on! [long pause; rustling; thick Northern accent] The Mersey Beat Awards for Couple of the Year goes to John and Yoko. [long pause] Irritant of the Year. [pause; nervous laughter]

MAL: Is he the Irritant of the Year?

RINGO: No.

PAUL: Private Eye. On the paper.

RINGO: Oh, that’s – I did see that, I apologise.

PAUL: Lying again.

RINGO: [referring to newspaper] See, I want that curly hair.

PAUL: Yeah, great, isn’t it? Bernard Levin.

RINGO: Bernard, that’s the one. I don’t want to say his name in case he sees me. [reading] “Yes, we’ve done it again!” says the Daily Mirror.

PAUL: “Yes, they’ve done it again!” says the Daily Mail.

RINGO: “Yes, we’ve—” [inaudible]

PAUL: “Well, we’ve missed it again!” says the daily work. [bleak; laughs]

MICHAEL: Would anybody like a cup of tea?

RINGO: No thank you.

PAUL: Yes, I’d like a cup of tea. With saffron.

### Notes

The gallows humour, surreal venue suggestions, and “Mersey Beat Couple of the Year / Irritant of the Year” bit all sit on top of the day’s real crisis: George has just walked out.

### Overview

In the immediate aftermath of George’s departure, John floats replacing him with Eric Clapton and bluntly raises the question: “do we want to carry on The Beatles?” Yoko’s repetitive vocalizing becomes part of a strange, tense jam as Michael tries to plan the show’s future.

### Dialogue

MICHAEL: I’ll check. [pause] Glyn! Glyn. Yoko wants a mic.

JOHN: I think, uh, if George doesn’t come back by Monday or Tuesday, we ask Eric Clapton to play in it.

MAL: [inaudible]

JOHN: I mean, if George is leaving the group—

RINGO: [inaudible] —then why did he leave the Creem group?

JOHN: But no, Eric would be pleased if George— He left Creem because they’re all—

RINGO: All soloists.

JOHN: —all soloists. Were it not [inaudible] he’d have full scope to play his guitar. The point is, if George leaves, do we want to carry on The Beatles? I do. [inaudible; drowned out by mic feedback] And I’d just get another member of the group and carry on. But if The Beatles split, well, I’ll get another group. [to Paul and Yoko?] I’m a singer not a dancer, baby! Woo-hoo!

MAL:

Personally— [inaudible] —do you really want to do it over here?

RINGO: I don’t particularly want to do it with another Beatle, but I will.

JOHN: Well hello there, Michael Lindsay Hogg.

MICHAEL: We have a lot of shots of the empty seat, we can lay the dialogue over it like in two movie times.

JOHN: We are?

MICHAEL: [laughs] Maybe we’re not going to get very much. [long pause] You see, maybe for the show, you could just say George was sick.

JOHN: No – I mean if he leaves, he leaves.

YOKO: [in background] John… John… John…

MICHAEL: But what’s the consensus? Do you want to go on with the show and the work?

JOHN: Yeah. If he doesn’t come back by Tuesday, we’ll get Clapton in.

YOKO: John… John… John…

JOHN: What!

YOKO: John!

JOHN: [screaming] What!

YOKO: John… John… John…

JOHN: Yoko! Anything you say, dear! I brought the tea!

YOKO: [screaming] John! John! John!

JOHN: [screaming] Yes!

YOKO: John?

JOHN: Yoko.

YOKO: John…

JOHN: Yoko!

YOKO: John…

JOHN: Yoko!

YOKO: John…

JOHN: Stop that.

YOKO: John… John…

MICHAEL: We could get Ike or Tina Turner over.

JOHN: Instead of George?

MICHAEL: Yeah.

YOKO: John… John… John…

RINGO: I’m afraid he’s not in!

YOKO: John! John! John!

JOHN: He’s busy!

YOKO: [screaming] John… John… John…

JOHN: Yes?

MICHAEL: What do the other lads feel?

MAL: Broken. ‘Cause we want to feel what the lads feel.

MICHAEL: About – just going on?

MAL: Essentially.

MICHAEL: Do it.

YOKO: [screaming] John! John! John!

JOHN: Bloody mad.

MICHAEL: And then what about the venues, as they say in the rock ’n’ roll— [audio mutes] —it’s a funny thing to say, but if it’s… I don’t know, I was going to say if – if it is – if George comes back we go away, and if Eric comes in we stay here. But I think if – I think we should go away.

JOHN: I think we should just go on, though.

MICHAEL: I think we should go away.

JOHN: As if nothing’s happening.

MICHAEL: Yeah. I think we should go away.

YOKO: John… John… John…

### Notes

John’s willingness to replace George contrasts sharply with Ringo’s reluctance to “do it with another Beatle.” Yoko’s relentless call-and-response with John turns the whole thing into an uneasy piece of performance art over a very real existential question for the band.
