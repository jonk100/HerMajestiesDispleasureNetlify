### Overview

As Michael Lindsay-Hogg pushes for a concrete plan for the concert/TV special, Paul tries to stir enthusiasm; George openly rejects the idea of returning to early Beatlemania–style performance. The discussion circles around whether they still want to “do it” live at all, and what “doing it” even means now that they’ve grown up.

### Dialogue

PAUL: But we had a lot more incentive, then.

GEORGE: Ah, but I was so much older then… I’m younger than that now… 

PAUL: But we really don’t need— You know, those films of us [back then]– that was us doing it, you know. 

GEORGE: [chagrined] Well, if that’s what doing it is, that’s why I don’t want to do it.

PAUL: Yeah. Yeah, I think—

GEORGE: Because I never liked that. It was always a drag. 

PAUL: [upset] Yeah, but – right. You know. You know, uh— [faltering] You see, that – that takes the thing, and – and twists it a bit.

GEORGE: Well, it does, because I never liked that. That’s why I—

PAUL: Well, you see, nowadays, you’ve grown up. And you don’t have to do that anymore. 

GEORGE: Yeah. 

PAUL: You see, that’s it. You don’t have to do – put the pancake [makeup] up, and go out in front and sweat, and shake our heads, because we’re not that anymore. We’ve grown up a bit. 

GEORGE: Because we’ve done that anyway.

PAUL: Yeah, right. So what I mean is, we did it then, but it doesn’t mean, like, to do it again, we have to do all that.

MICHAEL: Right.

PAUL: Because now, like – for him to do it, is do it in a black bag with Yoko, you know. [to John] And – and you’re doing it. [pause] I suppose. 

GEORGE: White bag. 

MICHAEL: A white bag.

PAUL: White bag. [pause; to John] But that’s it, you’re doing it, then, on this level, you know. But – you know. I mean, I—

MICHAEL: But do you see it as – do you still want to perform for an audience, or do you just see yourselves sort of as recording people?

PAUL: I think—

MICHAEL: You see, but I think John’s right. It’s communication. And I think part of communication is seeing you doing it. 

PAUL: I think there’s something to do with an audience, there, yeah. I think – [pause] I think we’ve got a bit shy, you know. I think I’ve got a bit shy of – certain things, you know. And it’s like, uh – it is like that. It’s like, um—

MICHAEL: I guess maybe the difficulty is also getting up in front of an audience, if – all you’ve done in front of an audience is trying to get something as good, but maybe not the same thing. You know, and it’s a very hard thing to get back. In other words, you musn’t think of getting back what you had. Because you don’t want—

PAUL: No, that’s what Yoko was saying the other day, you know. We don’t – we musn’t try and get in the audience, and get them wild, and get—

MICHAEL: Although they may be. [inaudible] Because they’ve grown up as well. I mean, everyone in this room has grown up. 

PAUL: Yeah. 

MICHAEL: You know what I mean?

PAUL: Sure, yeah. That’s – that’s what’s great about it, you know. That’s why I don’t think we need to sort of play down, or do anything – we’ve really got to do what we do, but like, with the same kind of… No, it’s not even – it’s not even discipline, it’s the same kind of—

MICHAEL: Drive. 

PAUL: Dr– desire to do it.

MICHAEL: Desire. To do it.

PAUL: You know, it’s like – it’s like all these songs, you know. There are some really great songs, and I just hope we don’t blow any of them. [to John] Because you know how often like on albums we sometimes blow one of your songs, because we come in in the wrong mood, and uh, you say, “This is how it goes, I’ll be back.” And we’re all just, [flustered voice] “Oh, uh, you—” Chuga chuga chuga chuga...

MICHAEL: That’s why we’re wrong to throw away the show. Because there’s no desire –  I mean like, sure, I think I, M. L. H., can do a show with you better than anybody in the world, because I’ve got to be the best rock'n'roll director in the world, he says without any false humility. But equally, at the moment, we haven’t got a show, and so none of us are gonna want to do it. 

PAUL: Yeah, I know what you—

MICHAEL: And the trouble is, that is why George was saying – he’s saying, “None of us want to do a show, because it ain’t a show.” And it’s like—

PAUL: Yeah. 

MICHAEL: —we’ve got to find something else to go out and do it.

GEORGE: And it’s that thing about – of the songs, too, you know. ‘Cause really, I don’t want to do any of my songs on the show, because I know they’ll always just turn out shitty, like—

PAUL: No, but you see – no, see, this is where I think, though—

GEORGE: Because, uh, they come out like a compromise, whereas in a studio they can—

PAUL: [anxious] But you see – look, George—

GEORGE: —work on ‘em, ‘til you want ‘em… and get it out of your mind.

PAUL: Last year, you were telling me, that, “You can do anything you want, Paul.”

GEORGE: Yeah.

PAUL: “Anything you desire, you can do,” you know.

GEORGE: Yeah.

PAUL: Now, but these days—

GEORGE: But you have to desire it.

PAUL: [trying] But you’re saying – before this show is finished, before we’ve done it— Now, like the arrow, letting forth, is letting forth on this word of, “We’re not going to be able to do it, we’re going to come out a compromise.” Now, I don’t think that! I really don’t. I think you – we’ve done it, you know. I think we’ve – I really think we’re very good. And we can get it together, if we think that we want to do these songs great, we can just do it great, you know. But I think thinking it’s not going to come out great won’t help.

GEORGE: Yeah.

PAUL: You know, that’s like – that is like meditation, where you just – you get into a bummer, and you come out of it. You don’t go through it, you know. 

RINGO: Yeah.

PAUL: I think we can, like, help, if we – you know, on anything like that. [to Ringo] If – so, okay, if you’re sick of playing the drums, we’ve all gotta say, “Look, we’re sick too, you know, pat pat, look, you know, it’s all the same,” and… we go through it with you. It’s no use just saying, “Well, fuck off, then.” “Oh, fuck that.” You know? What’s good, that?

### Notes

Key articulation of George’s aversion to old-style touring and of Paul’s “we’ve grown up” frame. Paul leans on motivation and mindset (“desire,” meditation) while George focuses on compromise and dissatisfaction with live compromises.

### Overview

The discussion shifts to show format (concert vs. documentary) and the band’s lack of enthusiasm. Paul confesses he’d perform “anywhere, anyhow” just to keep things going, and tries, with little success, to get John to discuss his real feelings.

### Dialogue

GEORGE: It would be nice – you see, uh, if we’re just singing these songs – for me to watch it, I’d be bored if it was, “Oh, haha, thank you, now we’d like to do…” and all that. Or if it was like just edited from – you know, clap clap, bam, and you know, like that, like they do those films, that would be better. 

PAUL: See, there is that possibility too, which is the one I originally thought this was going to be, actually. Which was not to have a documentary, but to have the show – have documentary and show, just intercut. But it’s not as good as – it’s half arsed. It’s two ideas in one, because neither of ‘em is good enough. 

MICHAEL: If it comes off – if this comes off, we’ve got great chaps, we’ve got a great entertainment package in an album, a documentary never seen before, and a performance. It’s a great package. 

GEORGE: Yeah, you know, I mean, a lot could come out of it if we could get the enthusiasm and the strength to do it. 

MICHAEL: See, I think that the truest thing is if we – if we get it together.

PAUL: [upset; to John] I mean, I’ll – I’ll sing in a corner with Mal on the tour, or I’ll sit here, and I’ll – I’ll anything. ’Cause I – I enjoy it all. That’s the only thing I enjoy, actually. [inaudible; drowned out by George’s and Michael’s voices] It’s terrible just to – I mean, imagine if you – if you were the only one interested. And I’m not easing it in, easing it in right now. I know you’re interested in that. But you won’t say anything to me about it.

JOHN: [long pause] I said what I’d been thinking. I would. And that is what I have. 

PAUL: [tired] Are you still thinking that now? What are you thinking now?

JOHN: [evasive] I’m still thinking about it. [continues playing]

### Notes

Paul’s “I’ll sing in a corner with Mal” line crystallizes his desperation to keep the band active; John’s evasiveness underlines the communication gap Paul keeps circling.

## 4

### Overview

Paul’s frustration boils over. He describes the entire project as school-like obligation, complains about apathy, and notes that all four Beatles privately ask Neil about “what the lads are doing” instead of talking directly to each other. Michael calls the current mood “the doldrums”; George bluntly says The Beatles have been in them for at least a year. Mal and Michael affirm the band’s importance to the world.

### Dialogue

MICHAEL: ’Cause otherwise, there isn’t any point in doing it. I don’t mean – I don’t mean us copping out in any way. I just mean, we oughta make – if we’re gonna do it, we oughta make it… very good. Stop me when – stop me when I’m— [inaudible]

PAUL: It’s like Mal said last night. “If you’re gonna do the show here, you’ve got to decide today.” And he sort of said it, almost frightened to say it, you know, to the lads. Didn’t really want to sort of shout at us. Didn’t want – but he had to say it, because if you do the show, you’re gonna have to decide today, you know, and it’s like that. And it’s like if you’re gonna do these songs, you’ve got to learn the chords. And we all know them. And we’ve got to learn the words. It’s just certain basic things that we’ve got to do, if we’re gonna do it. See, and as far as I can see there’s only two ways, and that’s what I was shouting about the last meeting we had. There’s only two things, you know. We’re gonna do it, or we’re not gonna do it. And I want a decision. Because I’m – I’m not interested enough to come to spend so many days farting around here while everyone makes up their minds about whether they want to do it or not, you know. I’ll do it. If everyone else will, and everyone wants to do it, then alright. [laughs bleakly] But it’s just a bit – a bit soft, you know? It’s—

MICHAEL: The point is—

PAUL: It’s like a school, you know, you’ve got to be here! And I haven’t. I haven’t, you know, I’ve… see, I’ve left school. We’ve all left school, and we don’t have to go. But it gets into a scene where you do have to go there.

MICHAEL: No, you see the first thing to get together is yourselves, totally. And then we all follow with our kit bags and our campers.

PAUL: So it’s like if we’re doing the show right now, we’re gonna have to work hard, and we’re gonna have to even think about how many songs that we’ll today have to have rehearsed, in order to by five days before it, to know ’em all. Now, five days before it is a week from now. And that means by the time a week from now comes, all these songs we’ve got, we’ve gotta know perfectly, and then [for] five days we’ll really, really get us to know it. You know, but I mean, there’s no – there’s no use to sort of waiting for the players themselves until we’ve got to put off the date and [inaudible] it to the cameras and say, “Don’t, we can’t have the cameras now.” [pause] It’s not like that, is it? [long pause] See, apathy’s alright, if— [inaudible; drowned out by George’s and George Martin’s voices] 

MICHAEL: [inaudible] —anyway.

PAUL: That’s alright, it’s allowed. 

MICHAEL: Yeah, sure.

PAUL: [inaudlble] —if it’s supposed to be opposite then you shouldn’t— [inaudible]

MICHAEL: So it’s, “Everybody, pull your socks up”?

PAUL: Sure it is, you know. Yeah I—

MICHAEL: The first day was the best musical day, for me it was a musical day, yeah. Because you routined about four numbers. [long pause]

PAUL: But I must say I’ll get, uh, put down, ’cause you know. Like if certain people aren’t interested, then I do… I lose interest. [long pause] And we can’t blame our tours or anything, or so on and so on and so on. [long pause] You see this one, that we’ve been having, this year, makes me really want to—

GEORGE: Last year. Last year.

PAUL: —snap out of it. Or snap into it. De-plastic it. But the past couple of months, you know, it’s been this, but the [White] album was like this, you see. The album was worse than this. This just seems sort of—

MICHAEL: What, agony?

PAUL: Well, just the whole idea of, do you want to do it? Do we want to do it? And that’s the joke, you see. After it all came about, Neil was saying to me we’d all phoned him individually, saying things like, you know, “Can you get ‘em together?” “Can you get it – oh, can you get it together?” “I want to know, what’re we doing?” You know. But like, instead of asking each other, we’ve all gone to Neil and asked him, “What’re the lads doing?” But you know, we should just have it out.

GEORGE: But we keep coming up again, that one. And like you were saying, “Yeah well I’d like to do this, this, and that, yeah, and I’d like to do this, and I’d like to do that, and I’d like to do that,” and we end up doing something again that nobody really wants to do. [laughs]

PAUL: Well then, you know, I think if this one—

GEORGE: Make it public, at that.

PAUL: Maybe it should definitely be the last for all of us. Because there just isn’t any point [inaudible]—

GEORGE: Yeah, that’s it. [long pause]

MICHAEL: I think I’d be sad. I mean, as an audience member, I’d be sad.

PAUL: Of course it is! It’s stupid, you know! It is just stupid. But, it’s even more stupid the other way. To go through it. Because – you know.

MICHAEL: I agree, but it’s—

GEORGE: ’Cause this time we could be using for what you want to be doing—

PAUL: You see, the thing is the people who are being stupid are the four of us. There’s nobody else. There’s only the four of us. You can’t actually, you know just sort of blame it on – ’cause there’s no other band, you know!

GEORGE: —and being creative, instead of being like in the doldrums, which it always is now…

MICHAEL: I wrote in my book, because I kind of keep a diary about what’s going on so I can cut it, and “doldrums” was the word I used. Because the doldrums have been coming, like – like to a ship on a [inaudible]—

GEORGE: Oh, The Beatles have been in doldrums for at least a year.

MICHAEL: You see, that is – that is terrible to say.

PAUL: [desperate] We – we haven’t played together, you see! That’s the fucking thing. But when we do come together to play together, we all just sort of talk about the fleeting past! We’re like old-age pensioners! “Remember the days when we used to rock?” You know, but we’re here now! We can do it, you know. But I mean, I’m – all I hoping for is enthusiasm from you so—

MICHAEL: That was – that was the idea—

MAL: [earnest] I’d just like to say that you are needed, you know. The Beatles are needed. To so many people, you know.

MICHAEL: Yeah, you’re right.

MAL: Whatever you do.

PAUL: You see the thing is also I – I get to a bit where I just sort of push all my ideas and I know that my ideas aren’t the best, you know. They are [mechanical voice] good, good, but they’re not the best, you know. But we can improve on it. Because we write songs together, and we improve on it. You know. [to Ringo] And you can improve on your drumming like it is, if you get into it. If you don’t, you know, okay, then I have better ideas, but if you get into it, you’re better! You know. It’s like that.

GEORGE: And after all that, it’s like, you know, what do they say? It comes from a – and the eaves springs out of an E—

MICHAEL: An ear.

GEORGE: And that’s, you know, all that existentialist crap. [laughs]

MICHAEL: Just like Jean-Paul, yeah, exactly.

GEORGE: You know, it’s like…

MICHAEL: You can call him John-Paul George, as opposed to Jean-Paul Sartre, you know. [laughs] We have a joke over here. You heard that, did you hear? Call him John-Paul George, as opposed to Jean-Paul Sartre, as a weird existentialism. [pause] Um, yeah. Like, it’s communication. And I think – I mean, see corny’s great, and like Mal said, it’s so corny that such a – I mean, he didn’t put it [as] corny, but it’s – you are terribly corny. [pause; scattered laughter] And that is what the world… [George starts singing ‘What The World Needs Now Is Love’] I mean really, ’cause – everyone in the world can say what they think except for you. We all need you. And you know, it’s the tears coming in the eyes of the little boy sitting in London as opposed to the little girl in America. And it’s communication. And it iss communication. And if you all can’t get it together, that’s really very sad. So, I feel what we should do now is let you play a little, and then you’ll have lunch together, and I can give you some more film, maybe. [pause]

PAUL: Yes.

MICHAEL: So, should we leave you for a while? I mean, if you—

PAUL: Yes, yeah.

### Notes

Captures the “doldrums” diagnosis and Paul’s “we haven’t played together” cry. Also underscores Mal and Michael’s view of The Beatles as culturally necessary, and Paul’s awareness that his ideas are not “the best” but need group refinement.

## 5

### Overview

In a quieter exchange, George explains why he’s sat on many songs for years, fearing they’d be dismissed in the studio; Paul argues that what matters is noticing problems together and resolving them. George floats, almost casually, the idea of a “divorce”. Paul says he’s already thought it; John breaks the tension with a joke about “the children”.

### Dialogue

GEORGE: Well, what I was saying about the songs was like, the reason, you know, like, I’ve got about twenty songs from 1948 was because I knew very well the moment I’d bring them in the studio, that – [blows raspberry] there it’s gone, you know.

PAUL: Yeah.

GEORGE: And, uh, so I never did. And, like, slowly now, I can bring a couple out because I can get it more like how it should have been then. And that’s – you know, it’s like, it’s just…

PAUL: You see, but it doesn’t matter what’s going wrong. It really doesn’t matter what’s going wrong, as long as the four of us notice it.

GEORGE: [disbelieving; laughs] Well, I’ve noticed it, alright. 

PAUL: No, but and – and – instead of just noticing it, determine to put it right, you know. [pause] ‘Cause that’s what I’m – that’s what I’m onto.

GEORGE: Maybe we should have a divorce.

PAUL: Well, I said that last week, you know. But it’s getting nearer.

JOHN: Who’d have the children?

PAUL: [pause] Dick James.

JOHN: Oh, yeah.

### Notes

The “divorce” talk is still half-jokey, but grounded in George’s longstanding sense of being creatively sidelined. Paul tries to reframe it as a problem they can collectively “determine to put right”.

---

## 6

### Overview

Paul articulates, almost directly to John, his determination not to let the band “crack up” and his frustration that the four of them never truly “talk it out” together. He accuses John of talking down (or not talking at all), then immediately admits the same critique applies to himself.

### Dialogue

PAUL: ’Cause you know, that’s what I was telling you on the phone, that… I’ll do it. Just because it is so silly of us now, at this point in our lives, to crack up. It’s just so silly. Because there’s no point! We’re not going to get anywhere that we wanna get by doing that. The only possible direction is the other way from that, you know. [pause] You know. That is the only possible direction. But the thing is we’re all just theoretically agreeing with it and not doing it. [to John] You’re doing your bit through you and Yoko, you know, but it’s silly, you know, to sort of, uh, coming and talking down to us. Well, actually your way out is not to talk, rather than talk down to us, which you’d have to do, you’d think, but you wouldn’t be. And remember, I think I’m talking down to you, too. [pause] But, you know, we’re not! [laughs bleakly] You know me. We’re all – we’re all alike, here, us four. But we just don’t sort of get to talk it out with each other.  

### Notes

A concise statement of the core communication problem: theoretical agreement without action, silence standing in for difficult conversation, and Paul’s recognition that the pattern includes his own behaviour.
