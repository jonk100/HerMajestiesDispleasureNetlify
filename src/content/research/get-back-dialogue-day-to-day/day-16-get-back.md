# 28 January 1969

## 1

### Overview

January 28th, 1969: The Beatles work on how to play 'Something', while George figures out the lyrics for the song.

### Dialogue

GEORGE: Attracts me like a pomegranate… [laughs] We could have that, "attracts me like a pomegranate."

…

JOHN: What were you saying?

GEORGE: I was saying, uh, "Did you know who missed the show?" And to a chorus of, "I don't know, I don't know."

### Notes

George working through the lyrics for 'Something', one of his masterpieces. The playful "attracts me like a pomegranate" shows him experimenting with imagery before landing on the more elegant final version. This song would become one of the most covered Beatles songs and a vindication of George's songwriting prowess.

### Overview

January 28th, 1969: After John and Paul play a lethargic and depressed run-through of 'All Things Must Pass', George tries to convince them that the song can be optimistic, too.

### Dialogue

GEORGE: But it's happy too, because it's like – it's like, if all things pass… it is sad [if] it means it's always gonna leave something there. Doesn't it? It means even badness must pass. You know. It's like… [long pause]

PAUL: Nothing's permanent.

GEORGE: 'Cause it said, uh, the last one says, "Darkness doesn't last all night time, and in the morning, it will fade away." [pause] "Sunlight—" What is it? "Daylight – is—"

PAUL: "The sunrise doesn't last all morning."

GEORGE: "Daylight is good at arriving at the right time." 'Cause it always does. It gets so dark, and suddenly – it just comes at the right time, and, you know. Like this was—

PAUL: It's another shade of darkness, isn't it? Or light.

### Notes

A philosophical exchange about 'All Things Must Pass', with George defending its optimistic message against John and Paul's depressive interpretation. George's insistence that "even badness must pass" is both about the song and a subtle commentary on the band's current difficulties. Paul's engagement shows he's listening and trying to understand George's perspective. The song would become the title track of George's acclaimed triple album after the Beatles' breakup.

### Overview

January 28th, 1969: In a not-uncommon instance of subliminal messaging (ergo musical commentary) during the Let It Be sessions, George sings a strain from Bob Dylan's 'Positively 4th Street'. Paul, unwittingly or not, joins in.

### Dialogue

GEORGE: And I know you're dissatisfied with your position and your place; don't you understand it's not my problem? I wish that for just one time, you could stand inside my shoes, and just for that one moment, I could be you… I wish that for just one time, you could stand inside my shoes… You'd know what a drag it is to see you…

### Notes

George's choice to sing Dylan's bitter 'Positively 4th Street' is deliberate musical commentary—a song about fake friends and being judged unfairly. The lyrics "I wish that for just one time, you could stand inside my shoes" directly address the empathy gap George feels with his bandmates, particularly Paul. This is subliminal messaging at its most pointed, using Dylan's words to express what George can't or won't say directly.
