### Overview

January 25th, 1969 (Apple Studios, London): After a protracted discussion about the prospective production value of (what will eventually be) the Let It Be documentary, George tries to allay Paul's underlying (overriding) concerns about the still-unstructured production and tells him that the group's best efforts have tended to be spontaneous anyway, and John points out that Paul's retainment of his original intentions for this project, in spite of its changes over the past three weeks, is what is causing him anxiety. Paul responds in a possible intimation of his own investment in the band in comparison to John's, and John, in possible acknowledgment of it, contends that he would dig playing onstage as The Beatles again, if not for the inertia they would inevitably labour under as a touring group.

As Paul bleakly compares their present monotony in the studio precisely to the monotony they felt while on tour performing the same songs over and over again night after night, George reasons (not unkindly) that it's an emotional cycle that everyone goes through, no matter the state of affairs they're in, and in this case, feels the familiarity of Apple Studios (attendant film crew non-withstanding) would be better for the group's musical finesse than having to involve themselves with the hassle of touring again. Paul, however, remains uncertain of his own feelings and wonders aloud about why he feels them at all. Producer Glyn Johns, who has been listening in, sincerely vouches for the buoyant studio atmosphere and heartening improvement the band has made in the past couple of days, and Yoko, likewise, encourages Paul to ride on the upswing and not tie himself down with the variables.

### Dialogue

GEORGE: The things that've worked out best ever for us haven't really been planned any more than this has. It's just, you know, it's like you just go into something and then it does it itself, you know. Whatever it's gonna be, it becomes that, you know.

JOHN: See, it's turned out – that, for that, but it's not what Paul wants. Like, you know, it was – it's like if – say it's his number, this whole show. Well it's turned – it's a compromise. So now it's actually turned into our number more than his number. That's all.

PAUL: Yeah, and that's—

JOHN: And uh—

PAUL: —and that's alright, you know. It's—

JOHN: It's alright, but I mean that's what's bugging you, really. Because it's a different number, you know. It's turned into a rock number as opposed to a choir number or something, you know, like that. And uh… [quiet] it's just that, really. [silence]

PAUL:

But it's just funny to sort of realise that after this is all over, you'll be off in a black bag somewhere – on the Albert Hall, you know.

JOHN: Yes.

PAUL: And sort of doing shows and stuff, and you know, digging—

JOHN: Yeah, but I—

PAUL: —digging that thing of it.

JOHN: But I don't – I would dig to play on stage, you know.

PAUL: Yeah.

JOHN: I mean, if it was – if everything was alright and there was no messing, and we were just going to play onstage… you know.

PAUL: Yeah. But it's only that. It's only that. I'd like to see Ringo and us – [inaudible] you know, and all that. But I mean—

JOHN: That's why I said yes to the TV show. I didn't want the – the hell of doing it.

PAUL: —and I'd like that. I'd like that, see, so that's—

JOHN: Well, I like playing – 'cause that's why I went on the Stones show [Rock and Roll Circus], you know?

PAUL: Mm.

JOHN: [faltering] And that's why I'll – I'll do – things, but I mean if – if we all don't want to do that…

PAUL: [reserved] Yeah, I know, it is that. It's like the majority decision to – yeah.

JOHN: [wary] But I don't want to sort of, uh, go on the road again. [silence; guitar playing]

PAUL: Yeah. I just feel as though we are on the road again. I mean, we are, but we're in the studio. Like, and we just keep to the same environment, totally. Always. We don't ever attempt to break out of that.

JOHN: Well, we did, though! We did.

PAUL: And that's – you know. So I mean—

GEORGE: Yeah. It's just, you break out of one into another and then you want to break out of that.

PAUL: Yeah, but I mean – you know.

YOKO: Maybe next week—

PAUL: [preoccupied] It is like the reason it's nice to live on the country, you know. Just because it's nice out there. It's nice in a warm environment, you know.

YOKO: [to Paul referring to the other Beatles?] Maybe next week they might change their minds, though.

JOHN: [to Yoko] [inaudible]

GEORGE: In my opinion this is the nicest place I've been for a long time, this studio.

PAUL: Yeah, it is.

GEORGE: No, really, you know. I mean, and also we've played – this is the most I've ever played, by playing everyday. And I can just, you know, feel myself getting – me fingers getting loose, a bit. Because we don't get a chance for that. But if we go out on the road, then – or whatever – it falls, it gets back into that one. But really I just want to play, and you can play better without having to, you know, do all those things.

PAUL: [preoccupied] Yeah.

GEORGE: I mean, it's not so bad now – but it is, really, it would be easier to play without all these mics and without all the cameras and things like that. But uh…

PAUL: Yeah, it's alright. [silence; George starts playing Bob Dylan's 'All I Really Want To Do']

…

PAUL: I don't know what it is, you know, that I'm moaning about, but it's just sort of—

GLYN: I must admit, I can't really see it like – [laughs; optimistic] because it's – it's just seeing the last two days, everything's gone so ridiculously well.

PAUL: It is, it's going great, really good.

YOKO: It's going great.

GLYN: We still need—

YOKO: [to Paul; encouraging] And maybe next week it might change, you don't know.

PAUL: Yeah, sure, I mean…

YOKO: I mean, it might be great… and everyone might feel like going outside, you know.

PAUL: Mm.

### Notes

A crucial conversation revealing the underlying tensions in the band. John accurately diagnoses that Paul's frustration stems from the project becoming "our number" instead of "his number"—a compromise Paul struggles with. Paul's cryptic "you'll be off in a black bag somewhere" likely references John's increasing separate activities with Yoko. George's measured response shows his growing confidence and articulation of his needs. The exchange reveals how each member is processing the band's direction differently, with Glyn and Yoko trying to inject optimism.

### Overview

January 25th, 1969 (Apple Studios, London): Uninterested in discussing the technical vagaries of the Get Back/Let It Be production with Paul and Michael-Lindsay Hogg any longer, John starts to riff on Paul's very first composition, 'I Lost My Little Girl'. Everyone else in the group eventually joins in to jam. (Note: John actually starts singing the song about three minutes prior to the start of this clip, when Paul is still in discussion with Michael Lindsay-Hogg. So, he's been going on for a while.)

### Dialogue

N/A

### Notes

John's choice to play Paul's first-ever song while Paul is engaged in serious production discussions is both an act of affection and subtle sabotage—a way to deflect from the heavy conversation.

January 25th, 1969: John and Paul amuse themselves with 'Two Of Us', singing it in German accents, Scottish accents, Jamaican accents, and… whatever else besides.

### Notes

Playful vocal experimentation titled "Eins zwei drei vier! You and I have memories" in the transcripts. Shows their ability to shift from tension to playfulness.

### Overview

January 25th, 1969 (Apple Studios, London): As the band starts to meander after several imperfect and increasingly unserious rehearsals of 'Let It Be' (including a stray comment from Paul that prompts John and George to break into Chuck Berry's 'I'm Talking About You'), Paul tries to steer them back to a serious run-through. John protests in jest and, perhaps reminded of the Beatles' improvised Christmas records, starts thanking the fans for all of the gifts they've sent. The next rehearsal of 'Let It Be' is foiled again by Paul and Ringo, however, enabling John to get into a mock-tirade about not even reaching the part of the song where he comes in (to the amusement of the group).

### Dialogue

PAUL: Come on now, come on now, come on now. Come on now – back to the drudgery.

JOHN: [mock-outrage] It's you that's making it like this, it's you that's bloody making it like—

PAUL: The real meaning of Christmas. [starts playing 'Let It Be']

JOHN: I'd especially like to thank you for all the birthday presents…

…

PAUL: There will be an answer, let it be… [falters; laughs] Then, is it—

JOHN: Ah!

PAUL: Ah.

JOHN: You shook me. [to Ringo] You stuck in another verse there, Richard.

PAUL: Yeah. You send me.

RINGO: What?

JOHN: He's got another verse in there, now. You come in with the flugle.

RINGO: Alright, John!

PAUL: [laughs] You only have to pick your nose and a camera and a boom is over there…

JOHN: Okay, this is your last chance.

PAUL: Now look boys, now come on. Enthuse a little.

JOHN: [mock-outrage] I can't, I don't even get up to my bit, you keep finishing! [everyone laughs] Shut up, will ya, or I'll have you banned from bloody Apple if you don't shut up! [Paul laughs; John subdues himself] Okay, "Let it be…" is where I come in… [laughter]

### Notes

John's mock-outrage at not getting to his part of 'Let It Be' perfectly captures the absurdist humor the Beatles use to defuse tension. Paul's acknowledgment of the ever-present cameras and microphones reveals their self-awareness about being filmed. The "real meaning of Christmas" quip references their tradition of making humorous Christmas records for the fan club.
