## 2

### Overview

January 14th, 1969 (Twickenham Film Studios, London): Paul sings a song he's written (or is simply improvising on the spot) in the spirit of Johannes Brahms' 'Hungarian Dance No. 4' (and which was quite probably inspired by the 1947 film Song of Love, which features the piece).

### Dialogue

PAUL: It's just for you that I sing this song of winter / It's just for you that I sing a song of spring / And every time the raindrops fall I think of summer / It's just for you that I sing a song of love. 

### Notes

Shows Paul's improvisational instinct and his ability to evoke classical/romantic musical forms.

### Overview

January 14th, 1969 (Twickenham Film Studios, London): While John and Yoko are being interviewed by CBC, a bored Paul decides to have a go at climbing the chain/rope equipment in the studio. Ringo and Mal do likewise. When John and Yoko return, Paul encourages John to have a go as well; John bemoans that he's too old, and starts in on interviewing Paul and Ringo in a humorous imitation of the interview he just had.

### Dialogue

PAUL: Okay, John. Right up the chains, to the top. 

JOHN: Alright, Paul!

PAUL: Come on, son, you can do it, son, I know you can do this, lad. [John attempts to climb] 

YOKO: John…

PAUL: My money's on him. [John presumably falls] See! [general sounds of sympathy and laughter] 

YOKO: [sweet] You're not eighteen, you know. 

JOHN: No, no. [high-pitched voice] It's alright. Don't worry about a thing, Yoko.

YOKO: He's not that young anymore, you see. [laughs] 

JOHN: No, I'm not eighteen anymore. I couldn't do it at bloody twelve, never mind… [Michael presumably helps out; to Michael] You're so kind. 

MICHAEL: Yeah, I'm courteous. [inaudible] 

JOHN: [pause; formal voice] Now, we were going to discuss, this afternoon, what religion meant to a pop star. And the pop star we've chosen is Ringo McCartney. Tell me, McCartney, does religion mean much to you in this present day, with all the trends and the swinging miniskirts that are about? [Yoko laughs] 

PAUL: Fuck all! Fuck all. 

JOHN: Well, I can see that's he's been disillusioned by the church in general in his remark of "Fuck all." 

PAUL: Yeah well I went to, uh, Brighton with the Maharishi. Fuck all it meant to me! 

JOHN: Was it an important step to you?

PAUL: Nothing, nothing. He didn't groove me. 

JOHN: He didn't groove.

PAUL: No. 

JOHN: He didn't smoke pot, by any chance?

PAUL: No. 

JOHN: What about the Reverend Nipples?

PAUL: Not a chance. 

JOHN: Not a chance. [pause] Well, do you like "X"[-rated] films?

PAUL: Yeah. Yeah. Lulu, Barry Ryan, and "X" films. But Maharishi – no. 

JOHN: That was a pretty concisive opinion of the youth of today. Now we're going on to a rather different group, uh, generation gap, and that's Tumble Starker! Who's sitting here. Now, what do you think about mock-Tudor shithouses in Weybridge and places like that? [Yoko laughs]

RINGO: [posh voice] Well, I don't mind them being in Weybridge. It's just when they try and put them in London, I think they get in the way of all the traffic.

JOHN: Yes, you're so right. As you said yesterday, "Neither your arse nor your elbow."

RINGO: [sage-like] I said that. 

JOHN: I couldn't – I'd never forget it. Well that's all for this evening. [hums broadcast theme tune] Hmm hmm hmm, hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm…

### Notes

Playful mock interview showing the group's absurdist humour and their willingness to fill dead studio time with comedy routines. John's parodic interviewer voice is spot-on.

### Overview

January 14th, 1969 (Twickenham Studios): With George still out of the band, the rest of The Beatles loll around unproductively in the studio. Ringo casually suggests for John and Paul to write together again, just to fill the time. John (being John) answers in the form of a less-than-conspicuous ditty.

### Dialogue

RINGO: Yeah, why don't you get together—

PAUL: [facetious] Yeah, are you interested at all? 

RINGO: —and write a song?

PAUL: [laughs] Really, yeah. 

JOHN: Actually, I'd say I started one last night. It goes something like this. You are definitely inclined towards it… Although sometimes I doubt it… 

YOKO: What are you joking about? [laughs] 

JOHN: Just… doing my new number. 

MAL: Is that the middle eight?

JOHN: That's the middle – I need a sort of chorus, and an outline. A format, to the, uh— 

PAUL: Common-garde. [general laughter]

### Notes

Ringo's suggestion to "write a song" is met with John's cryptic improvisation, possibly about Paul or the partnership itself. Paul's "common-garde" quip is a typical deflection.

### Overview

January 14th, 1969 (Twickenham Film Studios, London): Hard pressed to work on any new material, the group (sans George) talk idly about producer Glyn Johns' ancestry, the train sets an unrelated production company is preparing for a film inside the studio, and the plans for the next day's sessions. John and Paul interview each other about their non-existent projects, skirt the issue of John's health, and communicate in alternations of absurdity and obscurity.

### Dialogue

JOHN: Who's the fool on the hill, Paul?

PAUL: John. 

JOHN: [long pause] I'm trying to sell the house. [long pause] When I was young, so much younger than today, I never needed anybody's help, in any way. But now my life has changed in oh so many ways. A-whop-bop-a-luma… a-lim-bam-boom. [long pause] We should hold some sanctions against George. Very tightly. 

PAUL: Wheat. Coal.

JOHN: Yes. Wheat and coal. Bread loaves. Meat biscuits. Cardboard cut-outs. 

PAUL: You see the Thirty-Minute Theatre? 

JOHN: I did, but in a blue fuzz. But it didn't get through to me. Nice colour, though. [pause] I had a visit from a hippie family. Wondered why I had so many bedrooms. 

PAUL: [long pause] Were you able to tell them?

JOHN: Oh, yeah. I told them I've got a lot of bedrooms because I've got too many. And I offered them accommodation in Ireland, which they took up. 

PAUL: [long pause] Let's crack on. [sighs] 

MICHAEL: Who's got a match, as opposed to a lighter? 

PAUL: I have. 

JOHN: I have. 

MICHAEL: As opposed to a lighter. 

RINGO: A wooden one?

PAUL: Blue gold?

MICHAEL: A wooden one do, a wooden one not do… thank you. 

PAUL: I wooden wanna… 

MICHAEL: Are you [inaudible] John?

GLYN: [laughs] No, I am not related. 

RINGO: Stratford John?

GLYN: Nope. 

PAUL: Farmer John?

GLYN: Augustus John, apparently. 

MICHAEL: The John. 

GLYN: Rumour has it Augustus John is a grandfather twice removed or something. [laughs] 

MICHAEL: That's the way with most of us offspring [inaudible]. 

PAUL: [referring to the film equipment] Is that the new trick, the playback speed is up there?

RINGO: They've been there for several years. 

PAUL: Still feeding back. [laughs]

MICHAEL: Should we knock off early today or not?

PAUL: Probably, yeah. 

MICHAEL: Should we knock on early tomorrow?

JOHN: Yes, I'll do that. 

PAUL: Knock on early?

JOHN: Yes, I just uh… was up late, you know. 

PAUL: Yeah?

MICHAEL: At the moment you're a guest for lunch. 

JOHN: I was sort of stoned and high and watching films and I wouldn't have made it anyway. And uh… 

PAUL: Check up. 

JOHN: [subdued] Yeah, but it's not good if – I'm gonna come at ten, I should come at ten, you know.  

PAUL: Up with the dawn, down with the sun. 

JOHN: Mm. 

PAUL: Ringo ever, Eric never. 

YOKO: [referring to the previous night?] It was worthwhile, though, wasn't it?

JOHN: Oh, it was worthwhile. [Paul and Yoko laugh] 

PAUL: Does he make a lot of fun of you, Yoko?

YOKO: Not enough. [laughs] 

PAUL: Not enough. [John laughs] 

MICHAEL: I think they're painting the train. They'll be doing that while – whilst the time we're here. 

JOHN: We'd better get on before it leaves, then. 

PAUL: Please believe me. I'd hate to miss the train. Oh yeah. [pause] Like the shoes?

YOKO: Is that the fashion?

PAUL: This is the thing now, you know. 

YOKO: Mm. 

PAUL: The next thing. The socks are – the socks are with them, they come with them. 

JOHN: You did introduce oxford bogs, didn't you? [Paul and Yoko laugh]

PAUL: Yeah, yeah. I am an innovator in many ways. 

JOHN: Well, apart from your part-time work, what are you doing?

PAUL: Well, I do a lot of dramatic work, in and out of the country. 

JOHN: Presently, I'm working on a Welsh TV series called Land for Wecken, in which I appear as a Danish singer of royal blood who turned to folk singing after a disaster in the First World War where the Nazis bombed his house. 

PAUL: Mm. 

JOHN: And he had to move into, uh, Norway I think it was. Why, I was born on the train between Ostograd and Fensborough. 

PAUL: Jamaica?

JOHN: Sometimes. [Ringo laughs] But generally I have a hell of a mi-graine. So I usually take uh, frantic, which usually gets rid of it. It dissolves in half the time, you see. [pause] It gave me a great background for the job I'm doing now. 

MICHAEL: It's funny – it's funny, really. The guy said to me, do you mind if they store their trains quietly in the back? And they've come totally populated with painters and the rest of them.

JOHN: Now, the one thing you find about – we're not pushy. 

PAUL: No. 

JOHN: People want to put trains in the middle of our set— 

PAUL: —they get it. 

JOHN: [inaudible]

PAUL: [pause] Yeah. Mind you, we're not mugs. 

JOHN: Oh no. 

PAUL: Oh no. 

JOHN: [referring to Apple] We gave it all away. It was our plan. 

### Notes

Doug Sulpy describes John's voice here as having "an interesting quality […] as if, wanting to say something serious for a change, he's forgotten quite how." The Beckett-like absurdism hides real tension about George's absence and the project's stagnation.

### Overview

January 14th, 1969 (Twickenham Film Studios, London): With John, Paul and the others present seemingly loathe to rehearse or work on new material, John improvises a scene based on an earlier discussion about filming a Beatles detective thriller story in the studio. When director Michael Lindsay-Hogg expresses concern about how they should handle George's walk-out in their proposed documentary of the sessions, John suggests their current state of boredom would make a far more compelling film. As Yoko returns from making a phone call, John hooks onto the topic of Robert Baden Powell's dissuasion of masturbation amongst the Boy Scouts.

### Dialogue

JOHN: Is Cilla Black? [Paul laughs] Read next week's TV Times… and you'll never know. [phone rings coincidentally in the studio] Ah! [Paul laughs; John pretends to hold a phone conversation] Sir Joseph. It's about this deal with FBI. I need another million and the written acclimation of Dick James. [pause] I know it's hard, I know it's hard! But you're in position to do it, George.

MICHAEL: We were talking, earlier—

JOHN: About the space between us?

MICHAEL: [laughs] About the gap between us. But about also like the documentary, which is grinding to a halt. How we'd do it.

JOHN: Grinding to a halt? I think it's taking off.

PAUL: [laughs] Taking— Here we go.

JOHN: "Loop the loop," as Frankie once said, the one-legged wonder.

MICHAEL: Ringo said that he thought we ought to just tell it like it is, which is what I thought, but Mal thought we oughtn't tell it like it is.

PAUL: I think we are.

MICHAEL: I think we are.

JOHN: Well uh…

MICHAEL: So those are the two camps, you might say, which goes back to the remark you were making earlier about Noël Coward.

JOHN: [facetious] Well I do object to all this camp on TV, including Baden Powell on his foreskin. It's one of the most upsetting things I've ever seen. Discouraging boys from masturbating in case he wets the sheets. [laughter] It's funny you should say that. [Yoko returns]

YOKO: What are you talking about?

JOHN: I'm talking about the Boy Scouts who aren't allowed to masturbate.

YOKO: Oh.

JOHN: It's very tempting when you're wearing shorts. If they only wore long trousers, maybe they'd stand a chance, you know. But I can tell you, you don't go blind, but very short-sighted. [uproarious laughter]

YOKO: Are you talking from experience, or just…?

JOHN: From experience. [laughter] I remember during an English lesson, as I came, I suddenly noticed I needed glasses. I thought, "God, they were right." But I'm not gonna give it up for anything! [Yoko laughs] All the tax I've earned. I should coco. [silence] We should dub on a spiritual message of that. [Paul and Yoko laugh]

### Notes

John's "taking off" vs. Michael's "grinding to a halt" perfectly captures the divergent views of the documentary's direction. The Baden Powell riff is classic Lennon shock humour.

### Overview

January 14th, 1969 (Twickenham Film Studios, London): As the day trudges forth without any productivity for the Beatles' second day without George in the group, Paul asks John about Two Virgins (under the flippant guise of a journalist) to which John responds with stiff sincerity. As director Michael Lindsay-Hogg comes round to confer, Ringo admits that he isn't feeling well and wonders about having some rest. Michael commiserates, but expresses concern about the impetus of the group and is worried that they will individually (and indifferently) wander off to their own devices if they don't have a routine schedule to solder them together as a working band – which prompts John and Ringo to sing a sentimental folk bar. Not being of the disposition to have serious discussions about the direction of the (Get Back/Let It Be) sessions, John, Paul, and Ringo (dis)engage in frivolous wit and references to the Laugh-In.

### Dialogue

PAUL: So what's the point behind Two Virgins? [Yoko laughs]

JOHN: It's a six-inch nail. [long pause] The main point behind it is to open people's minds to what's happening today. There are people all over the country humming into tape recorders, and we hope to bring them out into the open. And hum together. [pause] You understand?

PAUL: Hmm.

JOHN: Now sold one thousand three hundred due to the great promotion from Apple Dietetics.

YOKO: [laughs] Which is a figure you don't want to expose, necessarily.

PAUL: Is it very neat to do this in public, Mr. Lennon?

JOHN: I feel obliged, in the position that I am today as a pop idol and the power I have, to do something for the good, and uh, I feel obliged to speak out… [pause] And that's as simple as I can put it, really. Take Downing Street. South Orderly Street. Wimpole Street. All owned by the Queen. 'Nuff said. [silence; fidgeting]

MAL: [in background] Is anybody – wanna rehearse, or do songs, or—?

YOKO: [inaudible]

RINGO: I feel ill, actually.

MICHAEL: Do you? Was this a mistake [inaudible]?

RINGO: I don't. [laughter]

JOHN: I think a few days in bed…

RINGO: Yes, I think so too.

JOHN: Or maybe three days on the couch, depending on what your job is.

RINGO: I think two days in bed.

MICHAEL: Do you really not feel well?

RINGO: No, I just feel a bit… ill.

PAUL: [to Michael] Well, do you?

MICHAEL: I don't feel well, but I can't say, 'cause I'm the captain of the ship.

JOHN: Oh you can. [Yoko laughs]

PAUL: Why?

MICHAEL: No, I don't want to let the crew down.

JOHN: Nowadays, the captain gets off first.

MICHAEL: No, I go down with the ship.

YOKO: [inaudible]

JOHN: No he does, really.

MICHAEL: I feel tired, but I think it's tiring – disappointing.

JOHN: [bored] Hmm.

MICHAEL: But I have a feeling if we decide not to meet one day, we may never meet again.

PAUL: Well…

JOHN: Along this dusty road…

RINGO: We'll always meet again…

JOHN: On this dusty road.

YOKO: As they say, there's no business like no business.

JOHN: Again.

PAUL: Yeah.

YOKO: Again.

PAUL: And still the boom [mic] wasn't over them.

JOHN: Ooh, the Queen of Sheba wore falsies.

RINGO: [mock-surprise] I didn't know that!

JOHN: Didn't you know that? You weren't there at the time. [pause] Cleopatra was a carpet manufacturer.

RINGO: I didn't know that!

JOHN: 'Cause you weren't there at the time. [pause] Edgar Allen Poe was a shithouse.

RINGO: I didn't know that!

YOKO: What was John Lennon?

JOHN: A patriot. [Yoko laughs] I didn't know that. [laughter]

JOHN & PAUL: "Goodnight, Dick." [laughter]

JOHN: [sighs] That was Lennon and McCartney. Northern Sheds. Great Western Railway.

PAUL: Songs for all functions.

JOHN: Ross-Upon-Wye.

PAUL: Nige-Whalley-Mange.

JOHN: Ilford two, Western Middlodeons – terrible.

### Notes

Michael's "if we decide not to meet one day, we may never meet again" is met with a sentimental folk duet from John and Ringo, then more absurdist comedy. Yoko's "no business like no business" is perfectly placed.

## 8

### Overview

January 14th, 1969 (Twickenham Film Studios, London): As Paul jokingly suggests for the camera crew to capture Ringo (who isn't feeling well) if he sicks on the floor, John mentions superficially that he threw up during an interview filmed earlier in the day with Yoko for Canadian television – not from illness, but from recent irresponsible habits, possibly exercised the previous night. Paul, who is wearied by the lethargy of the proceedings, tries to engage John about the recording sessions and how they should work while George is gone, but John palters, and at turns they both fall back on oblique references and emotionally indeterminate allusions.

After John trades bad jokes with Ringo, Paul implores them to remember why they're here and that they can't idle forever, and John (seemingly contrite, if nonetheless facile) agrees to start rehearsing. Despite the others' reservations about his health, a subdued Ringo reassures that he's staying to play too.

### Dialogue

RINGO: Kevin?

PAUL: I think if we hang around a bit longer we can get Ringo being sick. [laughter]

JOHN: You – see, you missed me this morning, I did it for CBS. Just leapt off in the middle of the interview.

PAUL: Did you?

KEVIN: [in background] As a matter of fact, yes.

JOHN: No reason at all, except that I've been mistreating my body.

YOKO: I thought it was a happening.

JOHN: It was a happening.

PAUL: There was a lot of nervous tension, you know.

JOHN: Oh, yes.

PAUL: I mean, there was a bloody funny atmosphere in that room, mother.

JOHN: Aye.

MICHAEL: We missed out on the other day.

JOHN: Hmm?

MICHAEL: We missed it the other day, but then they wouldn't let us have it.

JOHN: They missed it too.

MICHAEL: Oh. Were they in colour or black and white?

YOKO: Colour.

JOHN: I never noticed that. Colour.

PAUL: [trying] See, what we need is a serious program of work. An endeavour. Not an aimless rambling amongst the canyons of your mind. [inaudible] —life.

JOHN: Take me on that trip upon that golden ship of shores… We're all together, boy.

PAUL: To wander aimlessly is very unswinging. Unhip.

JOHN: And when I touch you, I feel happy inside. I can't hide, I can't hide. [pause] Ask me why, I'll say I love you.

PAUL: What we need is a schedule.

JOHN: A garden schedule.

PAUL: Point A to Z. Travel to A to Z, and having reached the point – take a holiday.

JOHN: It's holiday time.

PAUL: Achieve something, everyday. [pause]

YOKO: It's a hell of a lot to ask for…

JOHN: That's sort of hard to live up to, Paul.

PAUL: [very quiet] It's very hard to live up to.

MICHAEL: Ernest Hemingway had a very good remark about that, which I've unfortunately forgotten. About achieving something everyday. It's the only thing of his writings I like.

PAUL: It may in theory sound silly, but—

JOHN: In practice…

PAUL: —it's even sillier. Well, if practice is all there is.

JOHN: This is where it's at.

PAUL: This is where it's at, unless that is where it's at.

JOHN: This is where it's at, now.

PAUL: Mm-hmm. [long pause] Teamwork. A good defense. And a line of forwards. A good strong pair of boots.

YOKO: [inaudible]

JOHN: You play ball with me, and I'll play ball with you.

PAUL: Don't swing the lead, sonny.

JOHN: Every cloud have a silver mouth boat.

PAUL: Could be learning something instead of this, you know.

JOHN: Bob Newridges is a tartan that covers Yorkshire.

PAUL: Rutland is the smallest county.

JOHN: Scarborough is a college scarf.

PAUL: Amo amas a minge.

JOHN: [laughs] Amanty meaty monkey monk… [Paul laughs]

YOKO: [to Michael] Are we going to see the rushes, or—?

PAUL: This is the – this is the typical end-product of an actor's career.

JOHN: Alexander the Great was a bighead. Or a fireplace. [long pause] Why do they call it Great Britain? How long is it going to go on? Fantastic France. Amazing America.

PAUL: Huge Spain.

JOHN: [laughs] Huge Spain. I'll drink to that. [pause] When is a door not a door?

RINGO: I don't know.

JOHN: When it's ajar.

PAUL: When it's ajar.

RINGO: Two flies on a door. Which one was sick?

JOHN: I don't know.

RINGO: The one on the panel.

JOHN: I don't blame it. [pause] Why did the chickie cross the road?

PAUL: You see what you've done to us, pal?

RINGO: To get to the other side.

JOHN: You've heard it before!

RINGO: Yes.

JOHN: Clichés…

RINGO: What goes over water, under water, and never gets wet?

JOHN: Hmm… a rubber mac.

RINGO: No, an egg in a duck's belly.

PAUL: [cutting in] Now, alright, we can't carry on like this indefinitely now, can we?

RINGO: I beg you?

PAUL: We can't carry on like this indefinitely.

JOHN: Doing this?

RINGO: We seem to be.

PAUL: We seem to, but we can't. Because our hearts are—

JOHN: Should we go play our group, then?

PAUL: There's the other point.

JOHN: I think this is rather good.

PAUL: It's alright, I must say, but we can't carry on like this indefinitely.

JOHN: As some clips in between.

PAUL: Yeah.

JOHN: [pause] As I said, I'm just recovering from the day, you know…

PAUL: Dyspepsia.

YOKO: From the night, frankly.

JOHN: [stage whisper] Oh, don't say that, you're be revealings!

YOKO: [laughs] Oh… I didn't think about that.

JOHN: "From the night", indeed. Next thing you'll be telling them about our black sheets! [laughter] Enriched with Marylebone Station… [fidgeting; gets up] Right. [to Paul] Guitars? I thought that's what they do.

PAUL: That is what they do, but if you're singing—

JOHN: Oh, I'll even sing you half a song I was writing.

PAUL: [gets up; to Ringo] C'mon. Sounds. How's – how's about?

RINGO: [subdued] Sound city… Yes, go on, I'll come.

PAUL: [concerned] How are you feeling?

RINGO: No, I just feel a bit off. Very—

PAUL: [joking; bleak] Last two years, actually.

RINGO: [laughs] No, it's not that. It's just that some days— [inaudible; drowned out by voice marking slate] —you don't know how you feel.

### Notes

Kevin Harrington is one of the production runners. The phrase "canyons of your mind" references The Bonzo Dog Doo Dah Band. Doug Sulpy describes John and Paul's exchange as "a duel of witticisms." During this period John was using heroin, which is the most probable cause—directly or indirectly—for his vomiting. Paul's repeated "we can't carry on like this indefinitely" finally breaks through the absurdist fog, and they reluctantly agree to rehearse.
