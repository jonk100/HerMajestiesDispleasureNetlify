# 24 January 1969

## 1

### Overview

January 24th, 1969: As John and Paul discuss their vocal arrangement for 'Two Of Us', John wryly points out the queerness in having them share lead vocals on a love song. Paul, undeterred, suggests the male-female singing duo Paul and Paula step in for them as a replacement.

### Dialogue

PAUL: Okay, "two of us riding nowhere," that's as if – [that's] said we're like – two, but then "we're on our way home—"

JOHN: It's like we're like a couple of queens.

PAUL: Yeah. Well, you know. Well, I mean, that's—

JOHN: We're a couple of queens…

PAUL: [American accent] That's just too bad. Unless you want to get Paul and Paula in. [pause] Poetic license, John.

JOHN: [American accent] You're telling me, Paul.

### Notes

John's observation about the queerness of two men singing a love song to each other is deflected by Paul's reference to Paul and Paula, a male-female pop duo from the early 1960s. The exchange shows their comfort with each other and the inherent intimacy in their songwriting partnership.

### Overview

January 24th, 1969: After John and Paul run through another take of 'Two Of Us', Paul comments on the narratives and discreet emotional correlation between their songs.

### Dialogue

PAUL: It's like, uh, "We have to get back." "We're on our way home."

JOHN: Yeah.

PAUL: There's a story. There's another one – 'Don't Let Me Down'. "Oh darling, I'll never let you down." Like we're doing—

JOHN: Yeah. It's like you and me are lovers.

PAUL: [reserved] Yeah. [pause]

JOHN: We'll just have to camp it up for those two.

PAUL: Yeah. Well, I'll be wearing my skirt for the show, anyway.

### Notes

Paul identifies the narrative threads running through their Get Back songs—themes of return, home, and mutual support. John makes explicit what Paul implies: these songs read as love songs between the two of them. Paul's "reserved" response and shift to humor ("wearing my skirt") suggests discomfort with the directness of John's observation.

### Overview

January 24th, 1969 (Apple Studios, London): Paul briefly breaks into a curious ditty during a lull between takes. (Note: Mr. Bengelstein, I presume?)

### Dialogue

PAUL: Balls to your partner / Arses to the wall…

### Notes

Brief improvised ribald song fragment. The note suggests possible confusion about the origin or reference.

### Overview

January 24th, 1969: John and Paul play through an old Lennon-McCartney song called 'I Fancy Me Chances', amuse themselves with their lunch orders, and ponder the etymological origins of "brer". Paul then talks to himself about being a carpenter.

### Dialogue

JOHN: Crepe corbett.

PAUL: Broccoli hors d'oeuvre.

JOHN: Sparrow on toast.

PAUL: … Boiled testicle.

### Notes

Absurdist lunch order improvisation, escalating from the merely odd to the grotesque. Typical Lennon-McCartney wordplay during downtime.

### Overview

January 24th, 1969 (Apple Studio): During a break in the Let It Be sessions, Paul makes up a song about his (less famous) dog, Eddie. To John's amusement and eventual participation, it turns into an extended ode to Beatles pets. (Note: Mentioned are Ringo's dog Tiger, John's dog Bernard, John's late dog Nigel, and John's cat Mimi. John's poem Good Dog Nigel recounts his unfortunate demise—at the hands of Aunt Mimi.)

### Dialogue

JOHN: [laughs] You have to sing it "There you go, Bernard". 'Cause he was given away.

JOHN & PAUL: [singing] There you go, Bernard, Bernard, Bernard… I'm so sad to see you go, Bernard, Bernard you dog.

### Notes

Lighthearted improvised song about Beatles pets. John's dog Bernard was given away, which explains the melancholic lyric. The reference to John's poem "Good Dog Nigel" about his childhood dog killed by his Aunt Mimi adds a darker undertone to the playfulness.
