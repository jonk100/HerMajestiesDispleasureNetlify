### Overview

January 21st, 1969 (Apple Studios, London): Paul leads the band into a lively rendition of Ronnie Hawkins' 'Forty Days' (itself a variant of Chuck Berry's 'Thirty Days'). John and Paul exchange some nascent wordplay on the Rolling Stone journalist Al Aronowitz and then break into an old Lennon-McCartney composition.

### Dialogue

JOHN: Another Lennon-McCartney original entitled 'All I Want Is You'.

PAUL: Al a one a two. Al Aronowitz. Al Aronowitz.

JOHN: Al Aronowitz if you'll Aronowitz. We'll both Aronowitz together.

PAUL: Too bad about sorrows / Too bad about love…

JOHN & PAUL: There'll be no tomorrow…

JOHN: For all of your love…

PAUL: You said you were sleeping / But I can't forget / The trouble you're leaving…

### Notes

Playful wordplay on journalist Al Aronowitz's name leads into an early Lennon-McCartney composition.
