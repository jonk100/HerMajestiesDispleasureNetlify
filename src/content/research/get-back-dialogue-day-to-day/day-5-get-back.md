### Overview

January 9th, 1969 (Twickenham Film Studios, London): With John and George yet to arrive, Mal and Ringo sit with Paul at the piano as he works on lyrics for the middle eight of ‘The Long And Winding Road’. Paul plays with different phrasings, searching for a line that balances emotional weight and verbal elegance.

### Dialogue

PAUL: All the pleasure from the many ways I’ve tried / But still they… “I’ve had lots of pleasure but said better,” you know. “I’ve had many pleasure, I’ve had much much more pleasure…” The many times I’ve been alone / The many times I’ve cried…

…

MAL: Put “waiting here” and “standing there.”

PAUL: Yeah, I was thinking of that. 

### Notes

Shows Paul’s drafting process in real time, including his instinct to discard clumsy formulations and Mal’s small but concrete suggestion (“waiting here” / “standing there”) that ends up fitting the eventual lyric logic.

### Overview

January 9th, 1969 (Twickenham Film Studios, London): Still before John and George arrive, Ringo sits with Paul at the piano. They talk about ‘Golden Slumbers’ and the originally intended music-hall feel of ‘Carry That Weight’. Paul imagines a verse about getting drunk and waking with “a weight upon my head,” then undercuts the drama with trivial everyday troubles.

### Dialogue

PAUL: That really should be like a fairy tale. “Once upon a time there lived a princess and…” Once upon a time / There lived a king / “Sleep pretty darling do not cry / And I will sing a lullaby.”

MAL: [laughs] And the king will sing a lullaby. 

…

PAUL AND RINGO: And this is why she said… She said, “Boy, you’re gonna carry that weight, carry that weight a long time…”

PAUL: Like their troubles, all their troubles. But it was like a comedy when I heard it, you know. [starts playing jaunty piano] Boy, you’re gonna carry that weight / Carry that weight a long time…

…

PAUL: See, I think there might a verse about, I got drunk, I got in trouble with the wife, got drunk, so on and so on and so on, and it all goes to the next morning with a weight upon my head, and I found out it was my head. [laughs; starts playing jaunty piano] Boy, you’re gonna carry that weight / Carry that weight a long time… Just sort of normal kind of troubles that everyone has, and then just boy, you’re gonna…

…

PAUL: But it could be one of those things where, you know like in those songs where you’ve got everything, and everything’s going so great, but like, “This morning, one of my eggs broke,” you know. [laughs]

RINGO: [laughs; plays piano] “The rabbit’s got away.”

PAUL: [laughs] Just something trivial. 

MAL: “Broke a mirror.”

PAUL: “My right shoe’s a bit tight.” Boy, you’re gonna carry that weight…

### Notes

Great snapshot of how Paul shadows heavy themes (marital trouble, hangovers) with consciously small, comic details. Ringo’s and Mal’s joking contributions show how collaboratively they riff their way toward “relatable” imagery.

### Overview

January 9th, 1969 (Twickenham Film Studios, London): As everyone waits for John and George to arrive, Ringo, Mal, and Michael Lindsay-Hogg listen while Paul continues shaping ‘The Long And Winding Road’. Mal connects Paul’s “winding road” to The Wizard of Oz and the Yellow Brick Road; Michael pushes Paul on how the song should end. Paul arrives at the idea of being led back to the door.

### Dialogue

PAUL: See I was thinking of having another – like the weather obstacle. 

MICHAEL: It’s beautiful. What’s it called?

PAUL: ‘The Long And Winding Road’. [tries playing; falters] The only trouble is I always think of the… The storm clouds and the rain / Break up over the winding road… [trails off]

…

PAUL: I suppose it should still be about this sort of winding road. I’ve just got that picture – just the winding road that leads to your door, it will never disappear, I’ve seen that road before, it’ll always lead me here, lead me to your door. [audio feedback] Oh no!

RINGO: [laughs] It’s a start.

MAL: What you’re talking is sort of like The Wizard of Oz. Did you ever see The Wizard of Oz?

PAUL: No no no, I didn’t, but I’ve—

MAL: ‘The Yellow Brick Road’?

PAUL: Yeah. I know. 

MAL: ‘The Long And Winding Road’. 

MICHAEL: It’s great. 

PAUL: You see, it’s also something… [starts playing again]

MAL: It’s got that feel about it, you know? [inaudible] —so [Dorothy] gets back to, back to the boys— [inaudible] —and she’s never going to see them again.

MICHAEL: Yeah, yeah, exactly. 

MAL: It’s a terrible feeling. 

MICHAEL: Heartbreaker, yeah. It’s great.

MAL: It made me cry.

…

PAUL: It could be like the thing that’s up ahead. The thing that’s up ahead / At the end of the road… 

MAL: Like, how about like the obstacles on the road, that you’re going over?

PAUL: No, but I think the obstacles – eh, you know. I have enough obstacles without putting them in the song. [laughs] 

MICHAEL: How’s it going to end? Is it going to end happily, or just – not sure yet? Is that the end?

PAUL: No, it should end something like this. But still they lead me back / To the long and winding road / You left me waiting here / A long long time ago / Don’t leave me standing here / Lead me to your door…

### Notes

Shows Paul’s reluctance to make metaphors too literal (“I have enough obstacles without putting them in the song”) but also how receptive he is to Mal’s emotional framing of the song as a “heartbreaker” about lost paths.
