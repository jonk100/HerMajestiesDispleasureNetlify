### Overview

January 27th, 1969 (Apple Studios, London): Over breakfast, John shows Paul a book he's had compiled of the various press articles covering John and Yoko's You Are Here art show. Paul reads aloud from some of the articles to the amusement of John and Yoko.

### Dialogue

PAUL: "Beatle John Lennon hugged actress Yoko Ono last night and said, 'My marriage is over. I am in love with Yoko. Of course my wife and I are not through legally—'"

JOHN: That they put "actress" is great.

YOKO: [laughs] No, they thought I performed in the Bottoms film. [laughter] They took it so seriously…

JOHN: Said it seriously.

PAUL: "How much does he love Yoko? 'Much more than I love the Queen.'" [laughter; Paul hums]

JOHN:

The layout of the book's really good though, the way he's done it.

PAUL: This – is this the layout?

JOHN: No, this is just the bit – that bit, you know. Because he's gonna have that folding out of the book, sheets, like, because – to get them all together. But it's just, you know. The packaging is great.

PAUL: It's good, yeah. Great. [inaudible; continues reading articles aloud]

?: What else is there?

JOHN: There's hundreds of things, you know, this is just the press part of it. There's all the letters I got, and the photos of the exhibition, and – yeah.

?: Oh, just this topic.

JOHN: Yeah. The whole You Are Here book, you know. Book of the film of the video.

?: And the policeman. Is that included in the film? The statement—

JOHN: No, no. This is just – just that one day. Reaction to one day.

YOKO: It's amazing, isn't it? Just for that one day.

PAUL: Yes.

JOHN: But it's just great you know, it's sort of like what we're doing now. We're doing a show, and then you bring in a book of the show—

PAUL: Yeah.

?: Who's doing it?

JOHN: Uh, publishing it?

?: Yeah.

JOHN: Cape. That's what I think—

YOKO: That's what – I think that's where we're going with, Cape.

JOHN: Yeah, I'm gonna go to Cape.

PAUL: Is there a next book that you'll be expecting?

JOHN: Yeah, but I owe it [inaudible] in the contract.

PAUL: Oh, indeed. Great.

JOHN: So they'll have to pay for it, and it's expensive. The other one's cost nothing to do.

?: Who does this for you?

YOKO: Oh, the [inaudible] or something.

?: Oh, you have a [clipping] service, do you? Yeah, great.

### Notes

Paul's willingness to engage with John's art projects shows his support despite the underlying tensions. The press clippings about John and Yoko's relationship and the "actress Yoko Ono" designation provide humor. John's comparison of his art book to their current documentary project ("We're doing a show, and then you bring in a book of the show") shows he's thinking across multiple media formats.

### Overview

January 27th, 1969 (Apple Studios, London): As producer Glyn Johns grouses about having been apprehended by the police on a petty driving charge (and causing him to be late to arrive in the studio), Paul commiserates and humorously shares his own peeved exchanges with policemen on the road.

### Dialogue

PAUL: Let me take you down, 'cause I'm going to…

GLYN: Can you believe that bleeding copper! [stuffy voice] "Oh, alright, I'll have to report this, you know, anything you say will be taken down," and it went through all that!

JOHN: Have you got a fag?

GLYN: Yeah.

PAUL: I had a terrible scene the other day on the motorway with a copper. 'Cause they stopped me, and I – I don't like it, getting stopped by police. I always get – I get obnoxious with them, you know. [Yoko laughs] 'Cause I'll just sort of check around to see if I'm in the right, and once I know I am, and they've stopped me, I get very… But they just stopped me because I was hogging the outside lane, and you're not supposed to do that. So he said, "You did, you know." You're going seventy. You've got to stay out there, but you're not supposed to get back in. So he stopped me, and then it really got sort of nasty after a bit. 'Cause Linda just had her hand round the back of my head, and then he said, "You can't possibly be in – in control!"

YOKO: [laughs] Oh, no.

PAUL: "You see how that young lady was fondling the back of your neck…" [uproarious laughter] And I said, "Oh, what's up with you, then? Don't you get it?" [laughter] You know, and it got really like that. "Oh! You can't book me for that, Constable!" You know, it got really sort of… "Oh, can't I!" [laughter] And of course, my tax. [laughs] They got me. My tax wasn't up to date and all.

JOHN:

Don't they just do it at the office for us?

PAUL: No.

JOHN: Oh. I probably haven't had one done since I started, then. [laughter]

PAUL: They keep doing that. I was going through Mersey Tunnel, and they keep stopping me in the Mersey Tunnel 'cause they see you and they just want an autograph. So I sort of thought, "Right, this time, they're not going to stop me." And a fella comes up, and I just – all the way through the tunnel, I did thirty. Just saw him in the mirror all the time. I thought, "You… you're going to stop me at the end and ask me for an autograph."

So he just sort of drives in front of me waves me down, so I'm just — ah! [laughter] – crash in with him and say, "No, no, I have no time, no time!" And he just… [grumbling] So he stopped me and said, "… Your tax." [laughter] Yeah. I can't stand that, I really go sort of funny with police. You know, police [inaudible] when nothing's been done, fighting against them before they've got me for anything. I don't like it.

### Notes

Paul's detailed story about being stopped by police reveals his confrontational streak and his resentment of authority. The policeman's accusation that Linda "fondling" Paul's neck means he can't be in control of the vehicle leads to Paul's cheeky response. John's admission that he probably hasn't had his car tax done "since I started" is classic Lennon obliviousness to practical matters.

### Overview

January 27th, 1969 (Apple Studios, London): A chipper George is the last to arrive at the studio while the rest of the group is having breakfast. He tells the group that he was up the previous night writing a song (prompting John to reveal that he's been having trouble sleeping himself), in mind of John's old advice to finish a song within the time you start writing it. This, in full awareness of John's own less-than-disciplined creative process, incites knowing laughter from the group. (Note: The song George wrote was 'Old Brown Shoe'.)

### Dialogue

JOHN: I have a complaint as a director of Apple – no bog paper.

PAUL: Oh yeah? [Yoko laughs]

JOHN: Terrible disgrace.

PAUL: They've got [it in] pink upstairs.

JOHN: Have they?

PAUL: Yeah. [George arrives]

JOHN: Hi.

PAUL: Hi, George.

GEORGE: Hello, how are you? Happy new year!

JOHN: [joking] George's just come from a party too.

GEORGE: [laughs] Yeah, I thought…

JOHN: Two hours extra sleep [inaudible].

GEORGE: Oh, I didn't, I went to bed very late. I wrote a new song, actually.

JOHN: I couldn't sleep.

GEORGE: I wrote a great song actually.

JOHN: About what? [taps out a familiar rhythm in question]

GEORGE: No, though – oh that, no, I just played with that bit. Just – a different one, altogether. Very exciting. [laughs]

JOHN: It's such a high when you get home.

YOKO: Mm.

GEORGE: Happy. Happy, and a rocker…

PAUL: Yeah?

GEORGE: Happy and a rocker! [laughs] Too much.

…

JOHN: Well, it's just so high when you get in at night.

GEORGE: Yeah, it's great, isn't it? [laughs]

JOHN: I just – you know, that bit like on acid, where you see a little hand miles away.

PAUL: Mm.

JOHN: I was just sitting there listening to the last bit. [stage whisper] "Help! What if I have? What if I haven't, today?" [laughter] You know, "[inaudible] Do they have anything?"

YOKO: You should just try in general.

JOHN: I just can't sleep! I just— [starts making garbled noises and sounds] You know. "I'm a feeling a little thing here…" [makes the sound of a trumpet blaring; laughs]

GEORGE: Uh, I keep thinking, "Oh, I'll just go to bed now," and then I keep hearing your voice from about ten years ago saying, "Finish 'em straightaway. As soon as you start 'em, you've got finish it too." [pause] You once told me it was best to finish a song, so I was just there to… [uproarious laughter]

JOHN: [laughs] But I never do it, you know. I can't do it. But I know it's the best.

PAUL: Yeah.

### Notes

George arrives energized after writing 'Old Brown Shoe' overnight, following John's decade-old advice to finish songs immediately—advice John admits he never follows himself. The group's laughter at this hypocrisy is warm. John's description of his insomnia and acid-like sensations suggests he's struggling with something (possibly withdrawal or drug effects). George's creative burst and happiness is a positive sign for the sessions.

### Overview

January 27th, 1969 (Apple Studios, London): The Beatles play an extended run-through of 'Oh! Darling', with John offering harmony and call-and-response to Paul's lead vocal. (Note: A considerably shorter and edited version of this take was included on Anthology 3.)

### Dialogue

PAUL: When you told me…

JOHN: When you told me…

PAUL: You didn't need me…

JOHN: You'd never leave me…

PAUL: Anymore / You know I nearly broke down and died / Oh when you told me / You didn't need me anymore / You know I nearly broke down and died…

### Notes

The interplay between John and Paul's vocals on 'Oh! Darling' is poignant given the band's circumstances. John's harmony line "You'd never leave me" against Paul's "You didn't need me" creates a dialogue of abandonment and reassurance.

N/A

### Notes

## 6

### Overview

January 27th, 1969: Paul sings an amusing mock-German version of 'Get Back' (along with liberal doses of mock-French).

### Dialogue

N/A

### Notes

More playful vocal experimentation, showing the band's ability to find levity.

## 7

### Overview

January 27th, 1969: John and Paul play a bluesy mash-up during the Let It Be sessions, with John taking lead vocal for 'Get Back', and Paul singing an unidentified song (possibly made up on the spot) full of holy, apocalyptic fervor.

### Dialogue

PAUL: Order! Order! We've got to call order, John, I mean, you know, we're wasting valuable time here, son.

JOHN: Don't let me down, babe!

### Notes

Paul's attempt to rein in the jam session with "we're wasting valuable time" contrasts with John's musical response—a plea from 'Don't Let Me Down'. The exchange encapsulates their dynamic: Paul as taskmaster, John as resistant artist.
