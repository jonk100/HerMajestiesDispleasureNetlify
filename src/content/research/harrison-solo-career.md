## **George Harrison**

### **Successes & Artistic Highs**

* **The Masterpiece:** His solo career began with an explosion of creativity, the triple-album *All Things Must Pass* (1970). It is widely considered one of the greatest solo albums by any artist ever and yielded the global #1 hit "My Sweet Lord."
* **Pioneering Philanthropy:** He organized the 1971 Concert for Bangladesh, the first-ever large-scale rock benefit concert. It set the template for all future events like Live Aid and was a monumental achievement.
* **The Supergroup:** Co-founded the Traveling Wilburys in the late 80s with Bob Dylan, Tom Petty, Roy Orbison, and Jeff Lynne. The supergroup was a massive critical and commercial success, showcasing his collaborative spirit and sense of humor.
* **Consistent Hitmaker:** Enjoyed a string of successful solo hits including "What Is Life," "Give Me Love (Give Me Peace on Earth)," and his 1987 comeback hit "Got My Mind Set on You."

### **Failures & Criticisms**

* **The Disastrous Tour:** His 1974 solo tour of North America was a legendary failure. His voice was ravaged by laryngitis, and audiences were put off by his decision to rearrange Beatles songs and include lengthy sets by Ravi Shankar.
* **Inconsistent Output:** Following the massive high of *All Things Must Pass*, his mid-70s output (*Dark Horse*, *Extra Texture*) was seen as downbeat, preachy, and musically uninspired by comparison.
* **Spiritual Fatigue:** While his spirituality was central to his identity, critics and some fans grew weary of what they perceived as overly sanctimonious or lecturing tones in his music.

### **Overall Perception**

George Harrison's solo career is often viewed as a case of "getting it all out at once." The sheer quality and quantity of *All Things Must Pass* proved he was a songwriter on par with Lennon and McCartney. His career is defined by that initial peak, his deep spirituality, and his role as a humanitarian pioneer. While his output was inconsistent, his high points are considered magnificent, and he is respected as the "soul" of The Beatles.

> — *Billboard, 1970*
