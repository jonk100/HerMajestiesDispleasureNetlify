## Writing Tips for Capturing The Queen's Voice

- **The Formal Public Voice:** Most of her dialogue should be carefully constructed, formal, and carry the weight of her office. It is often anchored in her deep Christian faith.
- **Understatement is Key:** Her humor and displeasure were almost always expressed through immense understatement. She rarely raised her voice or used aggressive language.
- **The "Twinkle":** Her wit was famous for the "twinkle in her eye." In writing, this translates to a dry, unexpected observation delivered with a straight face.
- **Duty Above All Else:** Her personal feelings are almost always subordinate to her sense of duty and the needs of "the firm." Her language reflects this hierarchy.
- **A Voice of Observation:** She often positions herself as an observer of events, people, and history, speaking from a unique vantage point of immense experience.
