---

January 3rd, 1969 (Twickenham Film Studios, London): In an amiable chat, George and Ringo admire Paul’s beard, George expresses his interest in The Band’s unorthodox living arrangements and drummer Levon Helm’s easygoing demeanour (comparing him favourably to Ringo), and Paul and George enthusiastically encourage Ringo’s songwriting efforts in spite of Ringo’s own admitted frustrations with his limited grasp of chords (ergo compositional range).

GEORGE: I think your beard suits you. Man. 

RINGO: [approving] Mm. [Paul laughs]

PAUL: Well, you know, I’m—

RINGO: Captain. [laughter] 

PAUL: Yeah. [laughs] But you know me about it, I’m just sort of, I don’t know about it, you know. It’s always – with anything, I’m—

RINGO: It’s great for the film. 

GEORGE: You just keep on until you do know about it.

PAUL: Exactly, yeah.

January 3rd, 1969 (Twickenham Film Studios, London): The Beatles revisit an early Lennon-McCartney number.

JOHN & PAUL: Wake up in the morning I don’t feel blue / ’Cause I know I got you / Get a funny feeling all day and night / Get the funny feeling you don’t treat me right / Should have read your letter / And then I’d know / Would have felt much better / Because I know you love me so.

---

January 3rd, 1969: The Beatles revisit ‘One After 909’, a song from from the Quarrymen days, and play it for the first time during the Get Back/Let It Be sessions.

PAUL: I never sort of knew what it was about before. I mean, so, she’s on a train—

JOHN: Yeah.

PAUL: And he sort of—

JOHN: And he goes to the station, and misses it.

PAUL: [laughs] But he goes back and finds that it was the wrong number. So—

GEORGE: “Wrong location.”

JOHN: [officious voice] To rhyme with station, you know.

PAUL: [laughs] That’s great, that. “The rail man said, ‘You’ve got the wrong location.’” “Well…” Great. [pause] Our kid’s been saying, “You should do that,” for years, you know, and we’ve always sort of, “Yeah, well, you know, Mike, you don’t understand about these things…”

---

January 3rd, 1969 (Twickenham Film Studios, London): An early country-and-western-tinged Lennon-McCartney composition is recalled and revisited. 

PAUL: I’ll wait until tomorrow / Till you come my way / That’s why I sit here / Alone and I pray…

JOHN & PAUL: Won’t you please say goodbye / This love has long since gone cold / Won’t you please say goodbye / How many times must you be told…

January 3rd, 1969 (Twickenham Film Studios, London): Amidst a discussion of what the Beatles should play for their projected live show to culminate the (Get Back/Let It Be) sessions  and the general concern of playing live again, John suggests they ride on the momentum that will be built from these sessions/song rehearsals and go directly into making a new album right after (instead of falling into their previous pattern of having long breaks in between recording sessions, which has affected their band chemistry and allowed them to become complacent). Whether John is intentionally implying the breakup of the Beatles as an eventuality or merely using an innocent turn of phrase is unclear, but it prompts both Paul and George to relays their optimism about the band’s future prospects as long as they remain focused.

George stresses the importance of rehearsing together until they have every number down by heart so that the band can go onstage again without insecurities and utterly assured of themselves and one another. He admits that the pain and tedium of the process has in the past frustrated his resolve in his own compositions and discouraged his level of involvement in the band (i.e. the others’ songs), but acknowledges that it is a necessary course to take and that they would not get anywhere without putting in raw hours of conscientious effort.

In this frame of mind, George contends that the Beatles could realign themselves once again as a band more than the sum of their parts if everyone approached every song as if it were their own with the same amount of care and creativity, and in a moment of (perhaps uncharacteristic) sentiment expresses that when the four of them have it together, there’s no one else he’d rather play with. 

(Note: Transcript under the cut, because I evidently have no concept of critical economy. In the audio clip, George drifts in and out of singing Janis Joplin’s ‘Piece Of My Heart’; John is the one on the organ halfway through.)

GEORGE: That band – uh, that band Bonnie & Delaney, for Apple, are more together than we’ve ever been. You know, as a band.

JOHN: Yeah.

GEORGE: [inaudible] You know, everyone’s who has ever been to see them playing, and sounding, their lives change. It’s really exciting when you hear a real groove on—

JOHN: You see, I think when we’ve done a month of this and that, and we do an album, that somehow we should either use what we’ve – the togetherness, to do the album. You know.

GEORGE: Yeah, to do a new one.

PAUL: Yeah?

JOHN: Yeah. But you know what I mean. We – we’re – we don’t fit. We’ve sort of run out of touch with it. If we get into the swinging of playing, let’s do an album after this album. You know, about a month later. That is, if we all— [inaudible]

PAUL: But I mean, you know—

JOHN: I mean, if we spend two – a month on this—

PAUL: We are.

JOHN: —just get to a good peak playing, and then we split.

PAUL: No, well, we should – we should sort of organise our career, man.

GEORGE: Yeah.

PAUL: Get our career together. And this, you know, this is like the idea of this. It’s to get us so we quite enjoy this. Of doing it again. And then what would we like to do next? Well, I would like— [inaudible] —to do a live show, lads?

GEORGE: Yeah. I think – I think when we learn to, like [inaudible] then we’d dig it. And we know ‘em all, what – you know, if somebody could say “that one” [and we could play them] when we were asked, that’d be great.
PAUL: Well, we can do it, but— [inaudible]

GEORGE: It’s just that choice. It’s like hard work, really, to do it. And uh, it’s – you know, it’s a drag to try and, you know – ‘cause I want to remember all the words—
PAUL: Right.

GEORGE: —and really, really get ‘em the way I want it to get ‘em, and to get the guitar, [and not keep being] made to perform when I don’t want to play the guitar. And then you’ve got to play the guitar… when you’re not ready for it. But that… that’s alright.

PAUL: I don’t know, you know, I mean—

GEORGE: I mean, we’ve got to do that in order to get the good bit.

PAUL: Right, yeah.

GEORGE: We’ve got to get through that bit of shit of the meeting until we get it together again.

PAUL: [receptive] You know, I can see it just – so we’re just working.

GEORGE: But – and also there’s so much to get out, you know…

PAUL: Yeah, right.

GEORGE: [sincere] And there’s nobody better to get it out with than us. For me, anyway, really. In my heart of hearts.

PAUL: [long pause; reserved] Yeah.

GEORGE: It should be where – you know, if you write a song, I feel as though I’ve wrote it. And mine versus – vice versa. You know, I mean – or to be involved, really, as much, as if… That was the good thing about the last album, [because] it’s the only album so far I’ve tried to get involved with.

PAUL: Yeah.

GEORGE: [inaudible]

PAUL: Mm.

GEORGE: The last one.

## 1/6

January 6th, 1969 (Twickenham Film Studios, London): While waiting for the other Beatles to arrive, Paul plays ‘Oh! Darling’ on the piano for the first time in the studio.

---

January 6th, 1969 (Twickenham Film Studios, London): John allies himself unquestioningly with Paul as the group tries out different lyric variations for the chorus of ‘Don’t Let Me Down’. George tries his best to offer his own input. (Note: This is the first part of an ongoing series breaking down that Paul and George argument in the Let It Be film documentary - the Lennon-McCartney team vs. Harrison. Judging by the session tapes, Paul seems to have had a surprising amount of creative involvement in what is essentially a John song. The dialogue that was eventually edited into the scene as depicted in the film is highlighted in bold.)

GEORGE: If what you’re saying is what [John] said, then it’s easy, ’cause if you don’t know the words, then he tells you what you’re saying.

PAUL: Yeah I know, but you see, like you said, it was corny before, and so to change the corniness, I was changing the words—

GEORGE: Yeah, but the corny beginsel I thought was the notes that he was doing, you know, and the way he was doing it, not really what he was saying— 

PAUL: Yeah. So – okay.

GEORGE: —and if it seems good, it doesn’t matter what—

PAUL: What I’m trying to say is, you can get – I think you can get around the beginsel by singing the corny notes first, and having new words, and – you know. So I’m – but it’s like – so we still have to try and do it. So you still keep saying it’s wrong. Well, let’s try it. And then when we’ve tried it, then we can see if it’s wrong, you know.

GEORGE: You already seem to have tried it a lot.

PAUL: Yeah, I know, but we haven’t – we still haven’t done this. I’m in love for the first time in my life. “Don’t you know it’s gonna last.” [pause] “I’ll never let it get away.” [laughs] It’s a love that lasts forever…

JOHN: “Forever and a day.”

PAUL: Yeah. There’s some – there’s some new words there. And – and guitar–

JOHN: I just haven’t tied to a way of singing yet.

PAUL: No, that’s what I mean, you know, that’s all I want – to just have them–

JOHN: Can you both do it, ’cause – okay.

PAUL: Yeah. I’m in love for the first time…

PAUL & GEORGE: For the first time in my life…

JOHN: Don’t you know it’s gonna last…

PAUL & GEORGE: Don’t ever let it get away…

JOHN: It’s a love that lasts forever…

GEORGE: I just wanna say— [playing halts]

PAUL: [to George] I just want to get a bit – we’ll try, you know. We’ll go right through. But you keep talking about it. 

GEORGE: You see, if he was, say, if it was like— [plays different rhythm] Like that, you know. “You know it’s gonna last.”

PAUL: [impatient] Yeah, sure, let’s just repeat whatever you say.

GEORGE: Don’t you know it’s gonna last…

JOHN & PAUL: I’m in love for the first time…

PAUL & GEORGE: For the first time in my life…

JOHN: Don’t you know it’s gonna last…

PAUL & GEORGE: Don’t you know it’s gonna last…

JOHN: It’s a love that lasts forever…

PAUL & GEORGE: It’s a love that lasts forever…

JOHN: It’s a love that has no past…

PAUL & GEORGE: It’s a love that has no past…

JOHN: Don’t let me down… [playing halts]

PAUL: Okay, that’s – that’s alright. That’s—

JOHN: Yes. [to George] I can’t hear you.

GEORGE: Right.

PAUL: No, uh—

GEORGE: I think it’s awful. I’m trying to get it started—

PAUL: Uh… okay.

JOHN: [to George] Well, have you got anything? To supplant it?

PAUL: [to George] Okay, yeah, come on. Do something better, then.

GEORGE: Well, I just think that, you know– I think, for a start, it’d be better to sing – [plays descending chords] instead of— [plays repeating chords] Ah… For the first time…

PAUL: Yeah, but see, in a way, that’s even cornier, I think. That – that little harmony bit, it’s just too – it’s too pretty.

GEORGE: Well it’s just there’s one holding – it’s like that. [plays staggered chords] I mean at the moment, it’s just— [plays straight chords] And maybe it’s cornier if you do [plays staggered chords], a groove like that—
PAUL: Yeah.

GEORGE: But if it’s something like that— [plays sustained chords]

PAUL: Okay. Now for the first time in my life… One, two, three – you take the lower one, then.

JOHN: I’m in love for the first time…

PAUL & GEORGE: I’m in love for the first time…

JOHN: Don’t you know it’s gonna last…

PAUL & GEORGE: Don’t you know it’s gonna last…

JOHN: It’s a love that lasts forever…

PAUL & GEORGE: It’s a love that lasts forever…

JOHN: It’s a love that has no past!

PAUL & GEORGE: It’s a love that has no past… [playing halts]

GEORGE: I thought we should do something like this— [plays different rhythm]

PAUL: No. You see—

GEORGE: [continues playing] It’s a love that lasts forever, love that lasts forever, love that lasts forever…

JOHN: [unconvinced] Yeah, well, that’s it. [pause] I think you should just get a corny one first, and then start doing that bit. You know, you’ll start to get the rhythm to it, and then sort of change it.

GEORGE: [plays differently] Love that’s gonna last… Da da da da da da…

PAUL: Yeah, that’s it. [George continues playing] Uh… [George’s playing halts] Let’s just sing, you know, the corny one. [laughs]

JOHN: Yeah, do the corny one.

PAUL: Just to get this bit, you know. And then we can like – you see, that’s it. We’ll make it better as it goes on.

JOHN: Yeah. I mean – I—

PAUL: But if we don’t, then it just doesn’t go on. You know, we’ve just gone round for like an hour, with nothing in our heads. Just— And we’re back, you know. So let’s—

GEORGE: I can keep doing the permutations, then.

PAUL: Yeah, I know, but let’s just sort of move on, now. Let’s just get this.

JOHN: I’d like to hear any of ‘em – right ones.

PAUL: Yeah. Right, okay. So repeat exactly what he says, but then we can’t, on one of the lines. So, I’m in love for the first time…

GEORGE: See, that’s why you don’t get any further, because you just kept using the same lines against the one that doesn’t work—

PAUL: [ignores] For the first time in my life…

JOHN: Don’t you know it’s gonna last…

GEORGE: [grudging] It’s a love that’s gonna last…

JOHN: It’s a love that lasts forever…

PAUL & GEORGE: It’s a love that lasts forever…

JOHN: It’s a love that has no past… [playing halts] Love that lasts forever, love that lasts…

PAUL: Okay, so how about, how about – changing ‘round these two, and when you sing, “don’t you know it’s gonna last,” we sing, “it’s a love that has no past.” And then we repeat, “it’s a love that lasts forever,” exactly. And then when you sing, “it’s a love that has no past,” we sing “it’s a love that’s gonna last.”

JOHN: Yes. I agree.

PAUL: Okay? So, I’m in love for the— “Love for the first time in my life.” “It’s a love that has no past.” Swap that 
one for the other. So that when he’s singing that, we’re singing the other. Then, “it’s a love that lasts forever,” repeat that – even though it sounds funny, it’ll be alright. And then, “don’t you know it’s gonna last.” Just try it through, roughly.

GEORGE: I’m trying to—

PAUL: Listen – uh, uh.

JOHN: I’m in love for the first time…

PAUL & GEORGE: Love for the first time in my life…

JOHN: Don’t you know it’s gonna last…

PAUL & GEORGE: It’s a love that has no past…

JOHN: It’s a love that lasts forever… [playing halts]

PAUL: Okay, uh, The only time that works, really, is on the last line. So we sing, “love for the first time—” Just, just try it all exactly as it is. Repeating that. We’ll just on the last time. Sing, repeat, “it’s a love that’s gonna last,” and then you say, “it’s a love that has no past.”

JOHN: Okay.

PAUL: You see, it’s verging between ridiculous and alright, that, you know. Singing different words. ’Cause it is like—

JOHN: That’s the bones of it, though. [inaudible; playing guitar] She’s in, she’s in pain, you know. [laughs]

PAUL: [laughs] Okay.

JOHN: I’m in love for the first time…

PAUL & GEORGE: For the first time in my life…

JOHN: Don’t you know it’s gonna last…

PAUL & GEORGE: Don’t you know it’s gonna last…

JOHN: It’s a love that lasts forever…

PAUL & GEORGE: It’s a love that lasts forever…

JOHN: It’s a love that has no past…

PAUL & GEORGE: It’s a love that’s gonna last…

GEORGE: Can I make a suggestion there, for the last line?

PAUL: What?

GEORGE: Well, forget the last line. It’s a love that lasts forever…

PAUL: It’s a love that has no past… dun dun dun dun dun dun. Don’t let me down… Okay.

January 6th, 1969 (Twickenham Film Studios, London): The Beatles run through the chorus of ‘Don’t Let Me Down’ and try to iron out the contentious problems with the arrangement. (Note: This is the second part of an ongoing series breaking down that Paul and George argument in the Let It Be film documentary. The dialogue that was eventually edited into the scene as depicted in the film is highlighted in bold. First part.) 

PAUL: So that’s – that’s near enough for the time being. [inaudible]

JOHN: We’ve still got that hole, like at the—

GEORGE: But really, it’s like that doesn’t sound all that… you know. I’m iffy on that.

PAUL: Well, we’re gonna improve on that. But the—

GEORGE: If we had a tape recorder now – just tape down, play it back, you’d throw that out straightaway.

PAUL: Yeah, right, but—

GEORGE: You know, really—

PAUL: Yeah—

GEORGE: —you’d throw it out right damn in—

PAUL: Okay. Uh. Well, okay, that’s the—

GEORGE: You know, it’s either be— I know, you know.

PAUL: Yeah, I know, but you— [makes helpless sound]

JOHN: [mediating] See, I think, there… [starts playing]

PAUL: [to John] Give in!

GEORGE: I’m in love for the first time…

PAUL: I give in.

JOHN: We’re right, but it’s wrong there, on that bit.

GEORGE: You see, the first one’s not bad. [playing halts]

JOHN: No, the thing that we’ve done is that we found out that’s the weak bit, right.

PAUL: Yeah.

JOHN: So we tried putting voices on it. But it’s still down to the rhythm, somehow. The ba— Love for the first time… [starts playing]

PAUL: But it was always weak on your guitar.

JOHN: [agreeing] Yeah, sure.

PAUL: That’s the weak bit of the song, that.

---

January 6th, 1969 (Twickenham Film Studios, London): John briefly invokes Little Richard’s ‘Send Me Some Lovin’’ as a musical guide for ‘Don’t Let Me Down’. (Note: You may listen to early-70s!John singing ‘Send Me Some Lovin’’ here.)

---

January 6th, 1969 (Twickenham Film Studios, London): John offhandedly asks if he’s supposed to sing on ‘Two Of Us’, prompting Paul to run through the song sharing vocals with John for the first time.

JOHN: Am I singing on this, or what?

PAUL: I don’t know, really. [pause] Melody. Two of us… You have to remember the words too.

JOHN: Yes, I’ve got ’em here.

PAUL: Well, learn ’em.

JOHN: Yeah. [pause] I almost know ’em.

---

January 6th, 1969 (Twickenham Film Studios, London): Paul and George have a fraught and ultimately sad exchange about responsibilities, expectations, and means to ends, with John in the uncommon role as mediator trying to move the sessions along. An increasingly anxious and self-conscious Paul is aware of his own tendency to direct the rehearsals but confesses himself at a loss for any other way to keep everyone productive, in tune, and in pace with their looming deadline without encroaching on everyone else’s egos, emotions, and individual working methods. George capitulates, contends his inability to conform to their current circumstances with Paul’s inability to compromise, and wonders despondently if Paul even knows what he really wants (for this project, for the group and its individual members, or for himself). (Note: This is the third part of a series breaking down that Paul and George argument in the Let It Be film documentary. The dialogue that was eventually edited into the scene as depicted in the film is highlighted in bold. First part, second part.) 

PAUL: You see, we’re really – we’re gonna have to sorta bring it together, because we’re all at odds, we’re doing that thing we did on The Beatles, we’re all playing, you know, like… [incoherent] Like in this verse, it’s two harmonies singing, trying to say some words, right. So like you know, you can just, duh duh dun… ch cha. And in the bits, when we need bits, we’re not—

JOHN: Yeah I know the bits. I’m just trying to sing it, and do it through.

PAUL: [plays] You know what I mean? We’ve got to get riffs, when the riff bits come up.

GEORGE: The riffs. Uh, there’s no riffs. I mean, it’s nice to get – just to get what you’re playing—

PAUL: No, but it’s just, look – you see, “you and I”, uh – on—

GEORGE: You and I, our memories…

PAUL: Uh, but it’s not – it’s not together, you see, so it’s not sounding together. Even on—

GEORGE: So we can only play until we – until we can find the bit—

PAUL: Or we can stop and say it’s not together.

GEORGE: Yes, then you’ve got to carry on until we get it together. So I mean, that’s all, that’s all I can do is play—

PAUL: Okay. Well, I, you know—

GEORGE: —until it sounds as though it’s blending with the rest—

PAUL: I never know what to say to that, you know, ’cause what I want to say is now come on, and play… you know.

GEORGE: Yes, I know.

PAUL: But I can’t, you know, because we get into that line.

GEORGE: It does.

PAUL: Okay. [laughs nervously] So, here we go. [starts playing] You know, I mean, well. Tell us something about that. I can’t make it eyond that. It’s like, it’s – it’s complicated now. So. See, if we can get simpler, and then complicate it where it needs complications, but it’s complicated in the bit—

GEORGE: It’s not complicated. I’m just gonna—

PAUL: I know, but I mean – you know.

GEORGE: I mean, I’ll play just the chords, if you’ll like, and—

PAUL: [hushed] No, come on, you always get like—

GEORGE: —and then – but that’s all I’m trying to do—

PAUL: [anxious] You always get annoyed when I say that. I’m – I’m trying to help, you know, but I always hear myself annoying you, and I’m trying to—

GEORGE: No, you’re not annoying me.

PAUL: —I get so I can’t say—

GEORGE: [acquiescent] You don’t annoy me [anymore?].

PAUL: But you know what I mean. You know, well, do this, then. [plays] And then… I don’t know. [long pause] Yeah. I can’t do it on film, either. [laughs; bleak] I don’t know if I can do it on camera. [long silence; guitar playing]

JOHN: Do you want me to keep this up? [plays riff] ’Cause I’m trying to find something that’s nice to sing to—

PAUL: Yeah, you see, I don’t mind—

JOHN: Yeah, and—

PAUL: —but doesn’t everyone agree that it’s confused at the moment?

JOHN: Yeah.

PAUL: So all I’m trying to say is – is like, let’s get the confusion unconfusing, and then confuse it. You know, like, we’re just – this is what we’ve been doing all afternoon. This is why we’re not getting anything done. You know, we’re just rolling on with it. We’ve only got twelve more days. So you know, we’ve really got to do this methodically, this one. Like unconfused, then a bit more confused, then a bit more, now try this drumming here, try this drumming there, now okay, let’s stop and go look into this bit—

JOHN: Well, I’ve got an idea. I should vamp, ’cause I’ve got to sing, and it’s hard going— [plays rhythm]

PAUL: Doing that?

JOHN: But it’s annoying, you know. And let me do it— [plays rhythm]

PAUL: Okay, can you do that—

JOHN: I’ll do just that kind of vamping. [plays rhythm]

PAUL: Yeah. [laughs] Drag it halfway through candid camera. [long pause; listening to John playing] Yeah.

JOHN: [reassuring] Forget about candid camera.

PAUL: [wan] Can’t, though. [quietly; to George] But you see we’ve been saying— [inaudible] —a lot of, uh— [inaudible] —that I can do about. You know, it’s like I’ve always found that – but I always feel it, though, like you think I’m trying to put you down, or stop you from playing, but I’m not. I’m trying to stop us all playing, until we know what we’re playing.

GEORGE: Yeah, but you’ve got to play it in order to find which fits and which doesn’t.

PAUL: Mm.

GEORGE: You see, that’s all you can do in this—

PAUL: But it’s like – I know, but I’m thinking of this other thing which is where we’re playing the solos. We’re improvising the solos, but we’ll play strict chords and strict rhythms.

GEORGE: Yeah.

PAUL: Without the vocals.

GEORGE: [inaudible; drowned out by playing]

PAUL: You know, but I don’t want to say it, because I really just hear myself as being the only one saying it. Always. And I just basically sort of sit there, like— [inaudible; drowned out by playing] —and I never get any support or anything. So I just think, “Oh well. [inaudible]” You know. It’s right. [to John] And you know it’s right.

JOHN: [consenting] Yes, alright, but I just don’t know what to do about it.

PAUL: Well, you know.

JOHN: You know, I mean, up ’til then—

GEORGE: I mean, I’ll wait until you figure out your bits and then work my part out, if you like.

PAUL: No no no—

GEORGE: It’s like that, it’s like a matter of working it out with you while you’re working your bit out. You know, if you’ve got your bass bit. [plays] You know, I mean, so. It just would—

PAUL: I know, I know, but I’m—

GEORGE: Because it’ll take even longer in a way, if there—

PAUL: Look, I’m not trying to say that, and I’m not trying to say that about you. You know, you’re doing this again as though I’m trying to say that, and what we said the other day, you know – I’m not trying to get [at] you. But what I really am trying to just say is, “Look, lads.” The band, you know. “Should we try it like this?” You know.

GEORGE: It’s funny now how it only occurs when you put the – on—

PAUL: I know, if this one is like, “Should we play guitar all through ‘Hey Jude’?” Well, I don’t think we should, 
but—

GEORGE: Well, okay, I don’t mind, I’ll play, you know, whatever you want me to play. Or I won’t play at all, if you don’t want me to play. Now, whatever it is that will please you, I’ll do it. [pause] But I don’t think you really know what that one is. [long pause; playing]

JOHN: [hedging] But do you want to take the [inaudible]?

GEORGE: [singing quietly] Going nowhere…

PAUL: [exasperated] No, okay, but don’t – come on. Look, you know—

JOHN: The galloping bit. And I’ll just vamp.

PAUL: Look, you know, the… [sighs] No, it’s not like that. You see, that’s it, it’s like, we can’t do this. We’ve really got to sort out this, ’cause we’re – this is  – we’re like – this is the one, you know. Now we’re rehearsing, and we’re trying to like get it together for a TV show, so we really – like you said, we’ve only been through four numbers, you know.

GEORGE: Mm.

JOHN: Well…

PAUL: So we’ve probably got to get some system to get through like twenty, or thirty, and no more, and have learnt them. And it’s probably going to be like sculpture. So that we get all the chords. So we can all vamp and all. Then we can all play, like, every solo we need. But like… You know what I mean? It’s got to sound as though it’s improving.

GEORGE: [careful] Yeah, well, it actually – it sounded to me, that for me, it was a waste of me time playing, when we started it today. I mean, I just started remembering then what it could get into the other day, after playing for around an hour, an hour and a half. And suddenly, you know, I just don’t find that my – that what I’m doing is starting to have something, you know. Have some structure to it. [pause] You know, that’s the thing.

PAUL: Yeah, I know, I know what you mean, you know. ’Cause it’s like—

GEORGE: You know, I mean—

PAUL: It’s just that that way of doing it, you know, puts me off the way I’m trying to do it, and—

GEORGE: [resigned] Well, that’s – you know. That’s all, then. I can only do me, in that one way, however I do it, 
you know. [long pause]

PAUL: [resigned] Let’s do another song.

GEORGE: [commiserating] No, come on, we just have to learn this—

PAUL: No, no, it’s – let’s just do something else.

GEORGE: Do you want to do… ‘Maxwell Silver Hammer’?

JOHN: [encouraging] Well, let’s do this, ’cause then we – we’re gonna come to this, or whatever it is. And the thing is just try and think what – the stage we’ve got to be in then.

PAUL: You just have to know that. I think we’ve wasted a lot of time, I think. I think we do like waste, physically waste a heck of a lot of time, you know, when the four of us are together.

January 6th, 1969 (Twickenham Film Studios, London): In a discussion with John, Paul acknowledges the reluctant leadership role in the band he’s found himself in for the past few years and worries how the convergence of anxiety and authority in his direction may be hurting the group as a whole. John tries to reassure him otherwise, and George tries to meet him.

GEORGE: But that’s like, I’ve learnt that bit, and I’m trying to – I’m trying to take that – those chords along with it…

PAUL: [inaudible; drowned out by George’s voice] I’m not trying to – I only want to ask you. You know.

JOHN: I think, it’s your song. And you’ve gotta— [inaudible] —gotta have it exactly how he wants to do it, you know. If you say, “Don’t play that, play that,” it’s up to you, you know. You sort of take it. ’Cause it’s your scene. If somebody’s gonna ask for [inaudible], it’s his song.

PAUL: But now I – now I’m scared of that. To be the boss. And I – and I have been, for like, uh, a couple of years. 
And we all have, you know. There’s no pretending about that.

JOHN: Yeah I know, but – but this—

PAUL: And no one is [the boss]. That is what we decided, you know. And no one is—

JOHN: But it’s all in—

PAUL: And no one’s – you know how rush— [audio cuts off] —and this is why, you know, it’s chaos—

GEORGE: You don’t boss out on us. It’s fine.

PAUL: Until it sort of… That’s why we take so long! Because, really, you know, and we get sort of – so that’s the thing. We can play it shitty and all. I – I think we can play it shitty like ten times, so it’s sort of in there, and then I think we can kind of play it quite good, then. But it’s only – I don’t know, it’s just like different approaches, you know. I think we’d be better just learn, just doing it all, like uh, you know, the Red Norvo Five. Just really, like, uh—

GEORGE: Vamping away.

PAUL: Vamping, sort of efficient vamping, really, you know, and then get the imaginative thing. You know. [pauses] But anyway, I know it’s impossible for us to go like – because we can’t get into the moment, ’cause you don’t do it like that, and— [plays riff]

GEORGE: I know, and I’m trying, but— [plays]

PAUL: No no no I mean, just, generally… [John sings ‘Two Of Us’ under his breath] It’s like when you’ve been trying to get me to do it and I do it. And that’s how I do it, but that’s not how you do it. [everyone plays]

JOHN: [laughs; stops playing] See, I suppose that’s how they do it.

---

January 6th, 1969 (Twickenham Film Studios, London): Paul, more out of desperation than decisiveness, proposes they resolve everyone’s conflicting working methods by allowing each one of them have undivided creative direction over their own compositions (which the others would then have to follow). George agrees with this solution, but John (having always had a more instinctive approach, as opposed to building songs brick by deliberate brick) suggests they continue to improvise. Paul briefly muses about the metaphysical nature of this discord.

PAUL: [inaudible; drowned out by guitar] —of seeing yourself nearly go round a past you’ve been down too many times, you know I go down it, you know, like us going on about this. I really don’t want to go back to that. And it’s just silly. And I just can’t think of any solution out of here. The problem is that we should all arrange our own tunes, and if you want improvisation, then we should just say, you know, right, and—

GEORGE: That’s the best way.

PAUL: —and we improvise here. But look, it puts on much more work on each one of us, then, because then you’ve got to work out my bassline.

JOHN: I’d say improvise it, like.

PAUL: Yeah. [laughs bleakly] It’s like a bunch of theories, isn’t it? It’s like, it’s not just to do with playing music, this. It’s far further reaching, this sort of – this thing, you know.

GEORGE: It’s always the far reaching end of it. It stems from the mad thing they call— [audio cuts off]

## 1/7

### ‘Golden Slumbers’ / ‘Carry That Weight’

January 7th, 1969: In the morning, Paul sings ‘Golden Slumbers’ and 'Carry That Weight’ by himself while waiting for the other Beatles to arrive in the studio.

### I think we’ve got a bit shy, you know. I think I’ve got a bit shy of – certain things, you know.

January 7th, 1969: As Let It Be filmmaker Michael Lindsay-Hogg discusses how The Beatles should hold their show, Paul tries anxiously to rouse up some enthusiasm from the rest of the group - encouraging George to see the fun in performing onstage again, and relating futilely to John’s interests - to little avail. Or response. (Note: This vague idea for a show eventually turned into the iconic rooftop concert. The song George is singing at the beginning is Bob Dylan’s ‘My Back Pages’.)

PAUL: But we had a lot more incentive, then.

GEORGE: Ah, but I was so much older then… I’m younger than that now… 

PAUL: But we really don’t need— You know, those films of us [back then]– that was us doing it, you know. 

GEORGE: [chagrined] Well, if that’s what doing it is, that’s why I don’t want to do it.

PAUL: Yeah. Yeah, I think—

GEORGE: Because I never liked that. It was always a drag. 

PAUL: [upset] Yeah, but – right. You know. You know, uh— [faltering] You see, that – that takes the thing, and – and twists it a bit.

GEORGE: Well, it does, because I never liked that. That’s why I—

PAUL: Well, you see, nowadays, you’ve grown up. And you don’t have to do that anymore. 

GEORGE: Yeah. 

PAUL: You see, that’s it. You don’t have to do – put the pancake [makeup] up, and go out in front and sweat, and shake our heads, because we’re not that anymore. We’ve grown up a bit. 

GEORGE: Because we’ve done that anyway.

PAUL: Yeah, right. So what I mean is, we did it then, but it doesn’t mean, like, to do it again, we have to do all that.

MICHAEL: Right.

PAUL: Because now, like – for him to do it, is do it in a black bag with Yoko, you know. [to John] And – and you’re doing it. [pause] I suppose. 

GEORGE: White bag. 

MICHAEL: A white bag.

PAUL: White bag. [pause; to John] But that’s it, you’re doing it, then, on this level, you know. But – you know. I mean, I—

MICHAEL: But do you see it as – do you still want to perform for an audience, or do you just see yourselves sort of as recording people?

PAUL: I think—

MICHAEL: You see, but I think John’s right. It’s communication. And I think part of communication is seeing you doing it. 

PAUL: I think there’s something to do with an audience, there, yeah. I think – [pause] I think we’ve got a bit shy, you know. I think I’ve got a bit shy of – certain things, you know. And it’s like, uh – it is like that. It’s like, um—

MICHAEL: I guess maybe the difficulty is also getting up in front of an audience, if – all you’ve done in front of an audience is trying to get something as good, but maybe not the same thing. You know, and it’s a very hard thing to get back. In other words, you musn’t think of getting back what you had. Because you don’t want—

PAUL: No, that’s what Yoko was saying the other day, you know. We don’t – we musn’t try and get in the audience, and get them wild, and get—

MICHAEL: Although they may be. [inaudible] Because they’ve grown up as well. I mean, everyone in this room has grown up. 

PAUL: Yeah. 

MICHAEL: You know what I mean?

PAUL: Sure, yeah. That’s – that’s what’s great about it, you know. That’s why I don’t think we need to sort of play down, or do anything – we’ve really got to do what we do, but like, with the same kind of… No, it’s not even – it’s not even discipline, it’s the same kind of—

MICHAEL: Drive. 

PAUL: Dr– desire to do it.

MICHAEL: Desire. To do it.

PAUL: You know, it’s like – it’s like all these songs, you know. There are some really great songs, and I just hope we don’t blow any of them. [to John] Because you know how often like on albums we sometimes blow one of your songs, because we come in in the wrong mood, and uh, you say, “This is how it goes, I’ll be back.” And we’re all just, [flustered voice] “Oh, uh, you—” Chuga chuga chuga chuga...

MICHAEL: That’s why we’re wrong to throw away the show. Because there’s no desire –  I mean like, sure, I think I, M. L. H., can do a show with you better than anybody in the world, because I’ve got to be the best rock'n'roll director in the world, he says without any false humility. But equally, at the moment, we haven’t got a show, and so none of us are gonna want to do it. 

PAUL: Yeah, I know what you—

MICHAEL: And the trouble is, that is why George was saying – he’s saying, “None of us want to do a show, because it ain’t a show.” And it’s like—
PAUL: Yeah. 

MICHAEL: —we’ve got to find something else to go out and do it.

GEORGE: And it’s that thing about – of the songs, too, you know. ‘Cause really, I don’t want to do any of my songs on the show, because I know they’ll always just turn out shitty, like—

PAUL: No, but you see – no, see, this is where I think, though—

GEORGE: Because, uh, they come out like a compromise, whereas in a studio they can—

PAUL: [anxious] But you see – look, George—

GEORGE: —work on ‘em, ‘til you want ‘em… and get it out of your mind.

PAUL: Last year, you were telling me, that, “You can do anything you want, Paul.”

GEORGE: Yeah.

PAUL: “Anything you desire, you can do,” you know.

GEORGE: Yeah.

PAUL: Now, but these days—

GEORGE: But you have to desire it.

PAUL: [trying] But you’re saying – before this show is finished, before we’ve done it— Now, like the arrow, letting forth, is letting forth on this word of, “We’re not going to be able to do it, we’re going to come out a compromise.” Now, I don’t think that! I really don’t. I think you – we’ve done it, you know. I think we’ve – I really think we’re very good. And we can get it together, if we think that we want to do these songs great, we can just do it great, you know. But I think thinking it’s not going to come out great won’t help.

GEORGE: Yeah.

PAUL: You know, that’s like – that is like meditation, where you just – you get into a bummer, and you come out of 
it. You don’t go through it, you know. 

RINGO: Yeah.

PAUL: I think we can, like, help, if we – you know, on anything like that. [to Ringo] If – so, okay, if you’re sick of playing the drums, we’ve all gotta say, “Look, we’re sick too, you know, pat pat, look, you know, it’s all the same,” and… we go through it with you. It’s no use just saying, “Well, fuck off, then.” “Oh, fuck that.” You know? What’s good, that?

### I mean, I’ll – I’ll sit in a corner with Mal, on the tour, or I’ll sit here, and I’ll – I’ll anything. ’Cause I – I enjoy it all. That’s the only thing I enjoy, actually.

January 7th, 1969 (Twickenham Studios, London): While Let It Be director Michael Lindsay-Hogg tries to engage the band in discussion about their proposed concert/television special, Paul tries anxiously to talk to John (who has been wordlessly strumming his guitar for the past half-hour) about performing together onstage again. 

GEORGE: It would be nice – you see, uh, if we’re just singing these songs – for me to watch it, I’d be bored if it was, “Oh, haha, thank you, now we’d like to do…” and all that. Or if it was like just edited from – you know, clap clap, bam, and you know, like that, like they do those films, that would be better. 

PAUL: See, there is that possibility too, which is the one I originally thought this was going to be, actually. Which was not to have a documentary, but to have the show – have documentary and show, just intercut. But it’s not as good as – it’s half arsed. It’s two ideas in one, because neither of ‘em is good enough. 

MICHAEL: If it comes off – if this comes off, we’ve got great chaps, we’ve got a great entertainment package in an album, a documentary never seen before, and a performance. It’s a great package. 

GEORGE: Yeah, you know, I mean, a lot could come out of it if we could get the enthusiasm and the strength to do it. 

MICHAEL: See, I think that the truest thing is if we – if we get it together.

PAUL: [upset; to John] I mean, I’ll – I’ll sing in a corner with Mal on the tour, or I’ll sit here, and I’ll – I’ll anything. ’Cause I – I enjoy it all. That’s the only thing I enjoy, actually. [inaudible; drowned out by George’s and Michael’s voices] It’s terrible just to – I mean, imagine if you – if you were the only one interested. And I’m not easing it in, easing it in right now. I know you’re interested in that. But you won’t say anything to me about it.

JOHN: [long pause] I said what I’d been thinking. I would. And that is what I have. 

PAUL: [tired] Are you still thinking that now? What are you thinking now?

JOHN: [evasive] I’m still thinking about it. [continues playing]

### We – we haven’t played together, you see! That’s the fucking thing. But when we do come together to play together, we all just sort of talk about the fleeting past! We’re like old-age pensioners! “Remember the days when we used to rock?” You know, but we’re here now! We can do it, you know.

January 7th, 1969 (Twickenham Film Studios, London): An increasingly exasperated Paul yells into the immovable and unspeaking void despairs about everyone’s commitment to this project and to making music together in general, bemoans their seeming inability to communicate openly and honestly with one another (and resorting to using Neil Aspinall and others as a conduit), and fears the worst about the Beatles’ future if this continues. Mal Evans and filmmaker Michael Lindsay-Hogg insist that staying together would be good not just for the band itself but for the world at large. 

MICHAEL: ’Cause otherwise, there isn’t any point in doing it. I don’t mean – I don’t mean us copping out in any way. I just mean, we oughta make – if we’re gonna do it, we oughta make it… very good. Stop me when – stop me when I’m— [inaudible]

PAUL: It’s like Mal said last night. “If you’re gonna do the show here, you’ve got to decide today.” And he sort of said it, almost frightened to say it, you know, to the lads. Didn’t really want to sort of shout at us. Didn’t want – but he had to say it, because if you do the show, you’re gonna have to decide today, you know, and it’s like that. And it’s like if you’re gonna do these songs, you’ve got to learn the chords. And we all know them. And we’ve got to learn the words. It’s just certain basic things that we’ve got to do, if we’re gonna do it. See, and as far as I can see there’s only two ways, and that’s what I was shouting about the last meeting we had. There’s only two things, you know. We’re gonna do it, or we’re not gonna do it. And I want a decision. Because I’m – I’m not interested enough to come to spend so many days farting around here while everyone makes up their minds about whether they want to do it or not, you know. I’ll do it. If everyone else will, and everyone wants to do it, then alright. [laughs bleakly] But it’s just a bit – a bit soft, you know? It’s—

MICHAEL: The point is—

PAUL: It’s like a school, you know, you’ve got to be here! And I haven’t. I haven’t, you know, I’ve… see, I’ve left school. We’ve all left school, and we don’t have to go. But it gets into a scene where you do have to go there.

MICHAEL: No, you see the first thing to get together is yourselves, totally. And then we all follow with our kit bags and our campers.

PAUL: So it’s like if we’re doing the show right now, we’re gonna have to work hard, and we’re gonna have to even think about how many songs that we’ll today have to have rehearsed, in order to by five days before it, to know ’em all. Now, five days before it is a week from now. And that means by the time a week from now comes, all these songs we’ve got, we’ve gotta know perfectly, and then [for] five days we’ll really, really get us to know it. You know, but I mean, there’s no – there’s no use to sort of waiting for the players themselves until we’ve got to put off the date and [inaudible] it to the cameras and say, “Don’t, we can’t have the cameras now.” [pause] It’s not like that, is it? [long pause] See, apathy’s alright, if— [inaudible; drowned out by George’s and George Martin’s voices] 

MICHAEL: [inaudible] —anyway.

PAUL: That’s alright, it’s allowed. 

MICHAEL: Yeah, sure.

PAUL: [inaudlble] —if it’s supposed to be opposite then you shouldn’t— [inaudible]

MICHAEL: So it’s, “Everybody, pull your socks up”?

PAUL: Sure it is, you know. Yeah I—

MICHAEL: The first day was the best musical day, for me it was a musical day, yeah. Because you routined about four numbers. [long pause]

PAUL: But I must say I’ll get, uh, put down, ’cause you know. Like if certain people aren’t interested, then I do… I lose interest. [long pause] And we can’t blame our tours or anything, or so on and so on and so on. [long pause] You see this one, that we’ve been having, this year, makes me really want to—

GEORGE: Last year. Last year.

PAUL: —snap out of it. Or snap into it. De-plastic it. But the past couple of months, you know, it’s been this, but the [White] album was like this, you see. The album was worse than this. This just seems sort of—

MICHAEL: What, agony?

PAUL: Well, just the whole idea of, do you want to do it? Do we want to do it? And that’s the joke, you see. After it all came about, Neil was saying to me we’d all phoned him individually, saying things like, you know, “Can you get ‘em together?” “Can you get it – oh, can you get it together?” “I want to know, what’re we doing?” You know. But like, instead of asking each other, we’ve all gone to Neil and asked him, “What’re the lads doing?” But you know, we should just have it out.

GEORGE: But we keep coming up again, that one. And like you were saying, “Yeah well I’d like to do this, this, and that, yeah, and I’d like to do this, and I’d like to do that, and I’d like to do that,” and we end up doing something again that nobody really wants to do. [laughs]

PAUL: Well then, you know, I think if this one—

GEORGE: Make it public, at that.

PAUL: Maybe it should definitely be the last for all of us. Because there just isn’t any point [inaudible]—

GEORGE: Yeah, that’s it. [long pause]

MICHAEL: I think I’d be sad. I mean, as an audience member, I’d be sad.

PAUL: Of course it is! It’s stupid, you know! It is just stupid. But, it’s even more stupid the other way. To go through it. Because – you know.

MICHAEL: I agree, but it’s—

GEORGE: ’Cause this time we could be using for what you want to be doing—

PAUL: You see, the thing is the people who are being stupid are the four of us. There’s nobody else. There’s only the four of us. You can’t actually, you know just sort of blame it on – ’cause there’s no other band, you know!

GEORGE: —and being creative, instead of being like in the doldrums, which it always is now…

MICHAEL: I wrote in my book, because I kind of keep a diary about what’s going on so I can cut it, and “doldrums” was the word I used. Because the doldrums have been coming, like – like to a ship on a [inaudible]—

GEORGE: Oh, The Beatles have been in doldrums for at least a year.

MICHAEL: You see, that is – that is terrible to say.

PAUL: [desperate] We – we haven’t played together, you see! That’s the fucking thing. But when we do come together to play together, we all just sort of talk about the fleeting past! We’re like old-age pensioners! “Remember the days when we used to rock?” You know, but we’re here now! We can do it, you know. But I mean, I’m – all I hoping for is enthusiasm from you so—

MICHAEL: That was – that was the idea—

MAL: [earnest] I’d just like to say that you are needed, you know. The Beatles are needed. To so many people, you know.

MICHAEL: Yeah, you’re right.

MAL: Whatever you do.

PAUL: You see the thing is also I – I get to a bit where I just sort of push all my ideas and I know that my ideas aren’t the best, you know. They are [mechanical voice] good, good, but they’re not the best, you know. But we can improve on it. Because we write songs together, and we improve on it. You know. [to Ringo] And you can improve on your drumming like it is, if you get into it. If you don’t, you know, okay, then I have better ideas, but if you get into it, you’re better! You know. It’s like that.

GEORGE: And after all that, it’s like, you know, what do they say? It comes from a – and the eaves springs out of an E—

MICHAEL: An ear.

GEORGE: And that’s, you know, all that existentialist crap. [laughs]

MICHAEL: Just like Jean-Paul, yeah, exactly.

GEORGE: You know, it’s like…

MICHAEL: You can call him John-Paul George, as opposed to Jean-Paul Sartre, you know. [laughs] We have a joke over here. You heard that, did you hear? Call him John-Paul George, as opposed to Jean-Paul Sartre, as a weird existentialism. [pause] Um, yeah. Like, it’s communication. And I think – I mean, see corny’s great, and like Mal said, it’s so corny that such a – I mean, he didn’t put it [as] corny, but it’s – you are terribly corny. [pause; scattered laughter] And that is what the world… [George starts singing ‘What The World Needs Now Is Love’] I mean really, ’cause – everyone in the world can say what they think except for you. We all need you. And you know, it’s the tears coming in the eyes of the little boy sitting in London as opposed to the little girl in America. And it’s communication. And it iss communication. And if you all can’t get it together, that’s really very sad. So, I feel what we should do now is let you play a little, and then you’ll have lunch together, and I can give you some more film, maybe. [pause]

PAUL: Yes.

MICHAEL: So, should we leave you for a while? I mean, if you—

PAUL: Yes, yeah.

### Maybe we should have a divorce.

January 7th, 1969: George talks about being treated like an equal, and in light of the worsening member relations, suggests The Beatles disband for good. 

GEORGE: Well, what I was saying about the songs was like, the reason, you know, like, I’ve got about twenty songs from 1948 was because I knew very well the moment I’d bring them in the studio, that – [blows raspberry] there it’s gone, you know.

PAUL: Yeah.

GEORGE: And, uh, so I never did. And, like, slowly now, I can bring a couple out because I can get it more like how it should have been then. And that’s – you know, it’s like, it’s just…

PAUL: You see, but it doesn’t matter what’s going wrong. It really doesn’t matter what’s going wrong, as long as the four of us notice it.

GEORGE: [disbelieving; laughs] Well, I’ve noticed it, alright. 

PAUL: No, but and – and – instead of just noticing it, determine to put it right, you know. [pause] ‘Cause that’s what I’m – that’s what I’m onto.

GEORGE: Maybe we should have a divorce.

PAUL: Well, I said that last week, you know. But it’s getting nearer.

JOHN: Who’d have the children?

PAUL: [pause] Dick James.

JOHN: Oh, yeah.

### You know me. We’re all – we’re all alike, here, us four. But we just don’t sort of get to talk it out with each other.

January 7th, 1969 (Twickenham Film Studios, London): A despairing Paul avows his own resolve to continue working and taking whatever challenge is offered (such as this prospective television concert/documentary project) for as long as it keeps the band going, and is baffled and dismayed by the others’ seeming ambivalence (if not outright aversion) to their current circumstances. He calls John out on his obtuseness and incapability to talk with him openly and honestly, and upon receiving no response, relents and admits that this criticism applies to himself as well.

PAUL: ’Cause you know, that’s what I was telling you on the phone, that… I’ll do it. Just because it is so silly of us now, at this point in our lives, to crack up. It’s just so silly. Because there’s no point! We’re not going to get anywhere that we wanna get by doing that. The only possible direction is the other way from that, you know. [pause] You know. That is the only possible direction. But the thing is we’re all just theoretically agreeing with it and not doing it. [to John] You’re doing your bit through you and Yoko, you know, but it’s silly, you know, to sort of, uh, coming and talking down to us. Well, actually your way out is not to talk, rather than talk down to us, which you’d have to do, you’d think, but you wouldn’t be. And remember, I think I’m talking down to you, too. [pause] But, you know, we’re not! [laughs bleakly] You know me. We’re all – we’re all alike, here, us four. But we just don’t sort of get to talk it out with each other.  

## 1/8

### ‘Freer’, ‘queer’.

January 8th, 1969: George introduces ‘I, Me, Mine’ and plays it for Paul for the first time. Paul and Let It Be director Michael Lindsay-Hogg inform him on his phrasing.

GEORGE: Uh, is that grammatic? “Flowing more freely than wine.”

MICHAEL: Yeah.

GEORGE: “Flowing much ‘freer’”? [pause] “Freer”?

MICHAEL: “Flowing more ‘freely’.”

PAUL: “Freely.” “Freer.”

GEORGE: It’s funny in writing, yeah – thinking of how you say it—

PAUL: “Freer.” For it’s sticky out here. [general laughter]

GEORGE: But I was thinking, “freer” – if there was a such a word as “freer”, is it f-r-e-e-e-r—

MICHAEL: No, it’s f-r-e-e-r, it’s f-r-e-e-r.

GEORGE: “Free—”

PAUL: Like “queer”, “freer”. [laughs] “Freer”, “queer”.

### Two of us wearing postcards…

January 8th, 1969: John and Paul sing a rollicking version of ‘Two Of Us’ in the style of Elvis Presley. (An edited segment of this performance was later included and featured in the documentary-film Let It Be.)

### I know that I can’t win but then / What can I do / You win again…

January 8th, 1969 (Twickenham Film Studios, London): John (with George accompanying on vocals) sings a strain of Hank Williams’ ‘You Win Again’.

JOHN: The news is out all over town / That you’ve been seen out and around / I know that I can’t win but then / What can I do / You win again…

### It sounds so hard to do. I mean, for you.

January 8th, 1969: George plays ‘I Me Mine’ to John for the first time. John snacks on food, opens Paul’s mail, and doesn’t pay much attention.

JOHN: Is that the end of it?

GEORGE: Yeah. It’s only that long—

JOHN: We can use it for a commercial. [laughs; bored] So uh, yeah. It’s fine. And what do we do about that?

GEORGE: Um, well, it’s just a bit – you see—

JOHN: It sounds so hard to do.

GEORGE: No, it’s… no.

JOHN: I mean, for you.

GEORGE: No.

JOHN: [falsetto] I me mine… You know, all that singing.

GEORGE: [starts playing again] All through the day, I me mine, I me mine, I me mine… All through the night, I me 
mine, I me mine, I me mine… No one’s frightened of leaving it, everyone’s weaving it, coming on strong all the time…

JOHN: [operatic] I me my me my me my me my oh…

GEORGE: All I can hear… [starts playing forcefully] I me mine – I me mine – I me mine…

JOHN: All the girls can come on and dance it. Hari [Krishna]s and fisherwives, and dwarves, and hunchbacks…

GEORGE: Even your tears, I me mine, I me mine, I me mine… No one’s frightened of playing it, everyone’s saying it, flowing more freely than wine…

JOHN: [derisive] Run along, son. [laughs] See you later. We’re a rock ‘n’ roll band, you know. Bom bo bom bo bom bo bom bo bom…

### When I’m up against the wall, Paul, you’ll find I’m on my best—

January 8th, 1969: After John dismisses all of the songs he’s come up with for the Get Back/Let It Be sessions, Paul asks John if he has written anything new to make up for it. He hasn’t. No one is thrilled about this.   

PAUL: Haven’t you written anything?

JOHN: [defiant] No.

PAUL: [tense] Haven’t you. [pause] We’ll be faced with a crisis, you know.

JOHN: When I’m up against the wall, Paul, you’ll find I’m on my best—

PAUL: Yeah, I know, I know, but I just wish you’d come up with the goods.

JOHN: Now, look. I think I’ve got Sunday off.

PAUL: Yeah, well, I hope that you can deliver.

JOHN: I’m hoping for a little rock ‘n’ roller.

PAUL: [sarcastic] Yeah, I was hoping for the same thing, myself, you know.

JOHN: [mocking] “Sammy loved his mammy, she hammy dammy dammy…” 

### I remember that on my sickbed in Bournemouth.

January 8th, 1969 (Twickenham Film Studios, London): George recalls the writing of ‘Don’t Bother Me’, the other Beatles’ high-chasing imbibing of George’s cough medicine, and a recent (re)encounter with poet Royston Ellis. 

GEORGE: [laughs] I remember that on my sickbed in Bournemouth. In fact, that’s what it was. You know I was in bed in Bournemouth, where we were on a summer season [laughs], and the doctor gave me some – some tonic, which had some amphetamine or something in it. Remember? And you all, like, drank it to get high. Just [inaudible] got you high. [inaudible] And that’s when I wrote that one. 

### I don’t think you’re dancing right, John.

January 8th, 1969 (Twickenham Film Studios, London): George leads a preliminary run-through of ‘I Me Mine’ and advises John and Yoko on their footwork. (Note: John and Yoko’s waltzing is featured in the Let It Be film documentary. George’s dance tips may or may not be passive-aggressive.)

GEORGE: I don’t think you’re dancing right, John.

### You stole into my heart like a creeping nun… My arteries were overwhelmed.

January 8th, 1969 (Twickenham Film Studios, London): An uneasy Michael Lindsay-Hogg tries to steer the band (or just Paul) back into discussing the logistics of their imminent televised concert and/or television documentary. Paul sings a strain of Carl Perkin’s ‘Your True Love’, and John improvises his own love song.

JOHN: You stole into my heart like a creeping nun… My arteries were overwhelmed. 

MICHAEL: That would be pretty good like as a melody.

JOHN: A malady?

## 1/9

### All the pleasure from the many ways I’ve tried

January 9th, 1969 (Twickenham Film Studios, London): With John and George yet to arrive at the studio, Mal and Ringo sit with Paul at the piano as Paul tries to figure out the lyrics for the middle-eight of ‘The Long And Winding Road’. 

PAUL: All the pleasure from the many ways I’ve tried / But still they… “I’ve had lots of pleasure but said better,” you know. “I’ve had many pleasure, I’ve had much much more pleasure…” The many times I’ve been alone / The many times I’ve cried…

…

MAL: Put “waiting here” and “standing there.”

PAUL: Yeah, I was thinking of that. 

### A verse about getting drunk and a weight upon my head

January 9th, 1969 (Twickenham Film Studios, London): With John and George yet to arrive at the studio, Ringo sits with Paul at the piano as they chat about the origins of ‘Golden Slumbers’ and the originally intended music hall leanings of ‘Carry That Weight’. 

PAUL: That really should be like a fairy tale. “Once upon a time there lived a princess and…” Once upon a time / There lived a king / “Sleep pretty darling do not cry / And I will sing a lullaby.”

MAL: [laughs] And the king will sing a lullaby. 

…

PAUL AND RINGO: And this is why she said… She said, “Boy, you’re gonna carry that weight, carry that weight a long time…”

PAUL: Like their troubles, all their troubles. But it was like a comedy when I heard it, you know. [starts playing jaunty piano] Boy, you’re gonna carry that weight / Carry that weight a long time…

…

PAUL: See, I think there might a verse about, I got drunk, I got in trouble with the wife, got drunk, so on and so on and so on, and it all goes to the next morning with a weight upon my head, and I found out it was my head. [laughs; starts playing jaunty piano] Boy, you’re gonna carry that weight / Carry that weight a long time… Just sort of normal kind of troubles that everyone has, and then just boy, you’re gonna…

…

PAUL: But it could be one of those things where, you know like in those songs where you’ve got everything, and everything’s going so great, but like, “This morning, one of my eggs broke,” you know. [laughs]

RINGO: [laughs; plays piano] “The rabbit’s got away.”

PAUL: [laughs] Just something trivial. 

MAL: “Broke a mirror.”

PAUL: “My right shoe’s a bit tight.” Boy, you’re gonna carry that weight…

### How’s it going to end?

January 9th, 1969 (Twickenham Film Studios, London): As everyone waits for John and George to arrive, Ringo, Mal, and director Michael-Lindsay Hogg listen as Paul tries to figure out the lyrics for the second verse of ‘The Long And Winding Road’. (Note: Mal’s reference to The Wizard of Oz reminds me of this interview he did in 1975 about him and Paul crying over John’s “I want a divorce” declarative.) 

PAUL: See I was thinking of having another – like the weather obstacle. 

MICHAEL: It’s beautiful. What’s it called?

PAUL: ‘The Long And Winding Road’. [tries playing; falters] The only trouble is I always think of the… The storm clouds and the rain / Break up over the winding road… [trails off]

…

PAUL: I suppose it should still be about this sort of winding road. I’ve just got that picture – just the winding road that leads to your door, it will never disappear, I’ve seen that road before, it’ll always lead me here, lead me to your door. [audio feedback] Oh no!

RINGO: [laughs] It’s a start.

MAL: What you’re talking is sort of like The Wizard of Oz. Did you ever see The Wizard of Oz?

PAUL: No no no, I didn’t, but I’ve—

MAL: ‘The Yellow Brick Road’?

PAUL: Yeah. I know. 

MAL: ‘The Long And Winding Road’. 

MICHAEL: It’s great. 

PAUL: You see, it’s also something… [starts playing again]

MAL: It’s got that feel about it, you know? [inaudible] —so [Dorothy] gets back to, back to the boys— [inaudible] —and she’s never going to see them again.

MICHAEL: Yeah, yeah, exactly. 

MAL: It’s a terrible feeling. 

MICHAEL: Heartbreaker, yeah. It’s great.

MAL: It made me cry.

…

PAUL: It could be like the thing that’s up ahead. The thing that’s up ahead / At the end of the road… 

MAL: Like, how about like the obstacles on the road, that you’re going over?

PAUL: No, but I think the obstacles – eh, you know. I have enough obstacles without putting them in the song. [laughs] 

MICHAEL: How’s it going to end? Is it going to end happily, or just – not sure yet? Is that the end?

PAUL: No, it should end something like this. But still they lead me back / To the long and winding road / You left me waiting here / A long long time ago / Don’t leave me standing here / Lead me to your door…

## 1/10

### I think I’ll be leaving the band now

January 10th, 1969: Following an (unrecorded) argument with John in the Twickenham Film Studios lunch room, George returns to the studio floor and decides to leave The Beatles. (George then drives out of London, goes home to Liverpool, and writes ‘Wah Wah’.) 

GEORGE: —I think I’ll be leaving the band now.

JOHN: When?

GEORGE: Now. [audio cuts off]

### Because they’re a songwriting team

January 10th, 1969: George has just left the studios after deciding to quit The Beatles;  George Martin, Neil Aspinall, and Let It Be director Michael Lindsay-Hogg discuss why. In the meantime, John, Paul, and Ringo jam through a dramatic, shrieking rendition of ‘It’s Only Make Believe’. (If you’re wondering: they’re a little drunk.) 

MICHAEL: The trouble is, once you leave, it’s very hard to come back.

NEIL: Not really. We’ll all have to meet him on Sunday, anyway. So he could be back, then. No, really, the box that George is in is, um – it’s him versus John and Paul when it comes to what he’s got to do and what he has to play.

GEORGE M.: And there’s the songwriting. Because they’re a songwriting team, and he’s – he’s his own team. And [inaudible] it’s tough. 

MICHAEL: Yes, but – John and Paul aren’t writing together much anymore, are they, really?

GEORGE M.: No, but nevertheless, they’re still a team. 

### Eggs thrown at us in Australia

January 10th, 1969 (Twickenham Film Studios, London): While Paul wordlessly plays Samuel Barber’s ‘Adagio For Strings’ in the background,  director Michael Lindsay-Hogg, producer Glyn Johns, and Mal Evans chat about incidents on tour with the Beatles and the Stones, prompting John and Ringo to share their own memories of touring during the onset of Beatlemania.

JOHN: [American accent] Oh yes. Why, I think of it every day. I think what fun we had, when we was The Beatles, playing and rocking, with the group around the world. I said, “Richard, you remember that?” And he says, “No, I hadn’t joined you then.” [laughter]

RINGO: The hotels, I have very fond memories of.

JOHN: [laughs] Yeah.

RINGO: The tour, I’m not so fond of.

JOHN: Having eggs thrown at us in Australia was one of my big moments.

RINGO: I was away for a long time with tonsilitis. [laughs]

JOHN: Ah, yes.

MICHAEL: Who went out instead?

RINGO: Bobby Nicol, Jimmie Nicol?

MICHAEL: Jimmie Nicol?

JOHN: Jimmie Nicol, who is now making a living as the twenty-ninth Beatle in New Mexico. [Michael laughs]

### Mersey Beat Couple of the Year

January 10th, 1969 (Twickenham FIlm Studios, London): After George’s walk-out of the studios (and the band), Paul, Ringo, Maureen, Mal Evans, Neil Aspinall, George Martin, and Michael Lindsay-Hogg sit around telling each other knock-knock jokes and facetiously discussing the band’s forthcoming live concert/television special plans. John and Yoko (who have been in another room doing an interview) return to the studio when the group is reading the day’s spread of newspapers.

GEORGE M.: Oh I do like to be beside the seaside…

MICHAEL: So at the moment, how’s America looking? Where’s, uh—

RINGO: America doesn’t… it isn’t nice at all.

MICHAEL: Doesn’t look nice at all. [pause] Where’s he gone?

GEORGE M.: John?

MICHAEL: Four-eyes.

RINGO: He’s most probably off painting somewhere.

PAUL: [snorts] Yeah, yeah. Sketching.

MICHAEL: Sketching, or writing a quick poem. Or a book. Or a diary.

PAUL: Probably in a bag in his dressing room with Yoko, you know. [general laughter] They brought their own bag with ‘em today.

MICHAEL: Hence the expression…

GEORGE M.: “Papa’s got a—“

MICHAEL & GEORGE M.: “—brand new bag.”

GEORGE M.: Snap.

MICHAEL: Snap. [laughs] “Papa’s got a brand new bag-snap.” Or a zip. So, uh… [long pause] The seven men are going out to Africa on Monday, right? [uproarious laughter] We’ve got a reconnaissance team.

PAUL: Seven Zulus going to Willesden on Monday. [laughter] To check it out.

MICHAEL: No, we keep adding all the time.

PAUL: Or Paddington Town Hall.

RINGO: A special hired jet Boeing 707 is taking a full haul to Constaninopole. To see what the weather’s like.

MICHAEL: [laughs] And the show will be done in Ethiopia.

RINGO: That’s a nice place. Did someone say that before?

MICHAEL: Ethiopia? Oh, that’s my joke! Do you remember my joke of Haile Selassie?

GEORGE M.: The Abyssinian?

RINGO: Isn’t he Brazilian?

MICHAEL: No, no – the punchline is “Haile Selassie”.

RINGO: Then what’s the bit before?

MICHAEL: And the bit before is, “Do you want to buy my tomatoes?” Do you want to buy my – it’s a queer Moroccan joke which I made up.

RINGO: “Do you want to buy my tomatoes?” “Haile Selassie.” [laughs]

PAUL: Very good joke.

GEORGE M.: Did you tell it to anyone here? Have we heard it yet?

MICHAEL: Well, some of them heard it on the first day, and rejected it. “Haile Selassie.” See, I thought it was a kind of nice rough trade, New York joke. “Haile Selassie.” But it goes through a list of things you would sell for money. [laughter] I find this very funny! I—

RINGO: Do you want to buy my potatoes?

MICHAEL: No.

RINGO: Princess Margaret. [Michael laughs]

PAUL: [inaudible]

RINGO: Knock knock.

MICHAEL: Who’s there?

RINGO: Charlie.

MICHAEL: Charlie who?

RINGO: Elizabeth Harden. [long pause; general laughter]

MICHAEL: I love knock-knocks. We were going to do one for the [Rock ‘n’ Roll] Circus, we were gonna have “Knock knock, who’s there?” and someone was gonna say, “That’s right.” And then, “What do you mean, ‘That’s right?’”

RINGO: [in background; to Maureen] I stole it from you, my dear, I know that. [Maureen laughs]

PAUL: [laughs] I don’t get it!

RINGO: What?

PAUL: “Charlie Elizabeth Harden”? [general laughter]

MICHAEL: The “who”, the “who” is there.

MAL: [laughs] That’s what you do!

RINGO: “Michael.” “Michael who?” “Bill and Ben.” [general laughter]

MICHAEL: I love knock-knocks.

GEORGE M.: I like the song ones.

MICHAEL: Who’s there?

GEORGE M.: Knock knock.

RINGO: Arthur. Is that?

MICHAEL: Is that who?

RINGO: Is that your Cornetto? [Michael laughs]

MICHAEL: Hiawatha.

RINGO: Hiawatha who?

MICHAEL: Hiawatha good little boy till I met you.

GEORGE M.: Knock knock.

MICHAEL: Who’s there?

GEORGE M.: It is Simon.

MICHAEL: Simon who?

GEORGE M.: Simon chanting evening… [general laughter]

PAUL: [to John and Yoko?; Cockney accent] Get in your bag! Get in here boy and get in your bloody bag! Go on! [long pause; rustling; thick Northern accent] The Mersey Beat Awards for Couple of the Year goes to John and Yoko. [long pause] Irritant of the Year. [pause; nervous laughter]

MAL: Is he the Irritant of the Year?

RINGO: No.

PAUL: Private Eye. On the paper.

RINGO: Oh, that’s – I did see that, I apologise.

PAUL: Lying again.

RINGO: [referring to newspaper] See, I want that curly hair.

PAUL: Yeah, great, isn’t it? Bernard Levin.

RINGO: Bernard, that’s the one. I don’t want to say his name in case he sees me. [reading] “Yes, we’ve done it again!” says the Daily Mirror.

PAUL: “Yes, they’ve done it again!” says the Daily Mail.

RINGO: “Yes, we’ve—” [inaudible]

PAUL: “Well, we’ve missed it again!” says the daily work. [bleak; laughs]

MICHAEL: Would anybody like a cup of tea?

RINGO: No thank you.

PAUL: Yes, I’d like a cup of tea. With saffron.

### Do we want to carry on The Beatles?

January 10th, 1969 (Twickenham Film Studios, London): In the aftermath of George’s walk-out of the studio and the band earlier in the day, John talks (sincerely or not) to Michael Lindsay-Hogg about letting The Beatles continue on as a group by simply replacing George with Eric Clapton, while Michael also talks idly with George Martin and the others about his chewing tobacco. In the background, Paul (who has been cushioning himself with a piano for the past hour, not speaking to anyone) plays ‘Martha My Dear’ on end, Yoko calls John’s name into her microphone in a similarly endless refrain, and the two seem to coalesce into an unusual jam.

MICHAEL: I’ll check. [pause] Glyn! Glyn. Yoko wants a mic.

JOHN: I think, uh, if George doesn’t come back by Monday or Tuesday, we ask Eric Clapton to play in it.

MAL: [inaudible]

JOHN: I mean, if George is leaving the group—

RINGO: [inaudible] —then why did he leave the Creem group?

JOHN: But no, Eric would be pleased if George— He left Creem because they’re all—

RINGO: All soloists.

JOHN: —all soloists. Were it not [inaudible] he’d have full scope to play his guitar. The point is, if George leaves, do we want to carry on The Beatles? I do. [inaudible; drowned out by mic feedback] And I’d just get another member of the group and carry on. But if The Beatles split, well, I’ll get another group. [to Paul and Yoko?] I’m a singer not a dancer, baby! Woo-hoo!

MAL:

Personally— [inaudible] —do you really want to do it over here?

RINGO: I don’t particularly want to do it with another Beatle, but I will.

JOHN: Well hello there, Michael Lindsay Hogg.

MICHAEL: We have a lot of shots of the empty seat, we can lay the dialogue over it like in two movie times.

JOHN: We are?

MICHAEL: [laughs] Maybe we’re not going to get very much. [long pause] You see, maybe for the show, you could just say George was sick.

JOHN: No – I mean if he leaves, he leaves.

YOKO: [in background] John… John… John…

MICHAEL: But what’s the consensus? Do you want to go on with the show and the work?

JOHN: Yeah. If he doesn’t come back by Tuesday, we’ll get Clapton in.

YOKO: John… John… John…

JOHN: What!

YOKO: John!

JOHN: [screaming] What!

YOKO: John… John… John…

JOHN: Yoko! Anything you say, dear! I brought the tea!

YOKO: [screaming] John! John! John!

JOHN: [screaming] Yes!

YOKO: John?

JOHN: Yoko.

YOKO: John…

JOHN: Yoko!

YOKO: John…

JOHN: Yoko!

YOKO: John…

JOHN: Stop that.

YOKO: John… John…

MICHAEL: We could get Ike or Tina Turner over.

JOHN: Instead of George?

MICHAEL: Yeah.

YOKO: John… John… John…

RINGO: I’m afraid he’s not in!

YOKO: John! John! John!

JOHN: He’s busy!

YOKO: [screaming] John… John… John…

JOHN: Yes?

MICHAEL: What do the other lads feel?

MAL: Broken. ‘Cause we want to feel what the lads feel.

MICHAEL: About – just going on?

MAL: Essentially.

MICHAEL: Do it.

YOKO: [screaming] John! John! John!

JOHN: Bloody mad.

MICHAEL: And then what about the venues, as they say in the rock ’n’ roll— [audio mutes] —it’s a funny thing to say, but if it’s… I don’t know, I was going to say if – if it is – if George comes back we go away, and if Eric comes in we stay here. But I think if – I think we should go away.

JOHN: I think we should just go on, though.

MICHAEL: I think we should go away.

JOHN: As if nothing’s happening.

MICHAEL: Yeah. I think we should go away.

YOKO: John… John… John…

### (Morning) Starting from scratch with Yoko there

January 13th, 1969: After George’s departure from the band on the 10th (Friday), Paul, Linda, Ringo, and Neil Aspinall start their morning in the studio discussing a band meeting held at Ringo’s house over the weekend, where John’s willful deference to Yoko drove George to walk out of the room, leaving matters amongst the group unresolved. Neil reassures Paul and Ringo that George still cares about the band, and only wants to settle everything equally and honestly amongst the four of them, without any outsiders.

Amidst everyone’s comments about Yoko’s over-involvement (ergo John’s recalcitrance), Paul admits that the protective seal the band formed around themselves over the years has made it difficult for them to regard anyone unfamiliar into their faction without some measure of hostility and paranoia - especially if they have been asserted into a creative and professional position equal to their own, as Yoko has by John.

PAUL: Waiting for you, ooh… Why don’t you know… what it could be…

LINDA: It’s a good thing if all four of you just got together – and nobody else. You know, it’s alright when we’re all just sitting around now.

RINGO: Did you go last night, Neil?

NEIL: Um – this is, um, just something I was talking to George about last night. And that was what he was saying, too.

RINGO: What?

NEIL: What he means. [About] just the four of you.

LINDA: Yeah, it’s—

NEIL: That’s what he means, you know. Nothing else.

RINGO: Yes.

PAUL: Yeah, I’m for that, you know.

NEIL: So am I.

RINGO: Yes.

LINDA: It’s the only way you’re gonna—

NEIL: That’s why he didn’t – that’s why he said, “I don’t believe you,” to John. Yesterday.

PAUL: Yeah… Key moment, that, wasn’t it?

NEIL: [wry] Yes. But he meant it. And I think John knew what he was talking about, too.

PAUL: Oh, John. [laughter] Sure he did.

NEIL: And that’s why George said it twice. When John said, “I don’t understand you, George,” and George said, “I don’t believe you. Forget it.” ‘Cause he thought [John] did understand him.

PAUL: [unsurprised] Of course he did.

LINDA: [wry] It was great.

NEIL: You know, and it’s that. It’s like the bullshitting bit where, like, that can go on, is silly.

PAUL: Yeah. But I think the thing is, like, we – John does bullshit, I bullshit, Ringo bullshits, George bullshits. You know, we bullshit. The problem is that it’s only John— [inaudible; Michael Lindsay-Hogg’s voice recording a phone call] —trying to be more influencing, and they’re thinking past it. And so you start to sort of give him more credit than he’s – than he’s due for, you know. And, like, with Yoko, you know – they’re real. They mean it.

LINDA: [laughs] I don’t dig that, though.

PAUL: Him and Yoko, you know, they – they—

LINDA: [pretends to sneeze] Go away!

PAUL: You know, they do mean it. But…

NEIL: [playing along] Everybody cough. Heeueck.

LINDA: [playing along] Heuuuueck go away. Heeueck.

PAUL: [sober] You know?

LINDA: [sincere] Yeah, I know what you mean. You know what you mean.

PAUL: But you know, I – I tend to think that about them, too. Like I was saying, you know. “Well, I’d rather write without Yoko, thank you.” Just because it’s – that’s the way I write. If I – like, if I was in Tunisia, I’d go up to the bathroom to write a song, and then come back when it was done to show it to you. And to sort of say, “Let’s do a couple more words, now that’s it all there, you know, now that there’s only a little…”

NEIL: Yeah.

PAUL: But it’s difficult starting right from scratch with Yoko there, ‘cause you start off on a – well, I do. I start off on a Yoko beam, you know. I start off sort of writing songs about white walls. [laughter] Just ‘cause I – you know, just ‘cause I think she – John and Yoko would like that. And they wouldn’t, you know. I mean, I give them too much credit for – for what I think they’d like. But that’s not true. They wouldn’t. They’re very straight. […] I mean, you know, it’s just like—

LINDA: It’s all about being away from each other, aren’t they?

PAUL: I think it’s—

NEIL: No, I don’t – I don’t think it’s that.

RINGO: Did you get in touch with John?

NEIL: Um, Mal did. This morning, in fact.

LINDA: That was the answering service.

RINGO: [to Neil] Oh, you guys – I thought you were, later on. [Ringo thought Neil contacted John after the band meeting, the previous night.]

NEIL: I couldn’t get him.

RINGO: No?

MICHAEL: Is he join – is he joining us?

RINGO: We don’t know.

NEIL: I suppose [John and Yoko] might, but nobody can expect as much.

RINGO: ‘Cause Mal couldn’t get him either, you know. He may be up now.

NEIL: So – nobody’s spoken to him?

RINGO: No no no. You can only get the machine. So someone should try again.

NEIL: [inaudible] But nobody’s answering it.

LINDA: [to Paul] Yeah, but it’s hard having a meeting, and everybody putting their two cents in and none of you all saying – anything.

PAUL: But that’s the other thing, having the meeting, you know. You came with me, and Heather came, and the animal—

LINDA: Yeah, I was going to say I shouldn’t go, but then…

PAUL: Yeah… [lighthearted] It’s such a temptation going out to Ringo’s for the afternoon.

LINDA: [laughs] Exactly.

RINGO: [bemused] What?

LINDA: Heather could play with Zak.

PAUL: It feels like a family outing. [Ringo laughs] Don’t really just want to go on my own.

LINDA: [sheepish] Yeah, I was going to say, “We really shouldn’t go,” but then I thought – well.

RINGO: Why?

LINDA: Well, it should’ve been—

PAUL: Well, it should have been the four of us, you know.

RINGO: Oh— [to Linda; reasonable] Well, you were out of the way.

PAUL: Oh, yeah, sure.

LINDA: Sure.

RINGO: I mean— [inaudible]

LINDA: Oh yeah, but you know, it’s just like…

PAUL: It’s – it’s still, it’s that thing, you know.

RINGO: Mm.

LINDA: When there’s something serious, and you have other people there talking about it, you get off the track.

PAUL: You know, it really is – it really is like a board meeting going on.

RINGO: [mock-stern; to Linda] If you would’ve just kept quiet, it could’ve all gone well.

LINDA: [playing along] Well, I had to talk every two minutes. [laughs]

PAUL: Ol’ Sir Joberry and his wife…

RINGO: [playing along] Damn Yankee. [laughter]

PAUL: You know, but that’s it. It’s like that. The board meeting with ICLI, and all the government bringing all the wives, [laughs] and mates, and kids, and animals – and everything.

NEIL: But it turns – it turns into— [inaudible]

LINDA: Well, Yoko is doing all the talking.

NEIL: But that’s – that’s the point, you see. You know that he’s going to, and you know that Yoko’s going to be sitting there, and so everybody else is like, “Fuck it.” You know it’s not going to be a [proper] board meeting, so…

PAUL: Yeah, right.

NEIL: “Let’s make it a party.”

PAUL: Sure, that’s – that, really, that—

LINDA: But she does so much talking for [John], now.

PAUL: But see, now, so what do you do about that? That’s what I was saying about songs, yesterday, you know. I’m – I know that if – to write any more with John, I’ve just gotta, like, figh– [faltering] you know, forget it.

LINDA: But I think that whole—

PAUL: See I think it’s – it’s us, uptight about that. I really do – I think, uh…

LINDA: The king.

PAUL: See, it’s like – the trouble with us – like, John said it yesterday – it’s like, anything that comes up on all of our little egos, we try and push out. And anybody – it’s always been that. Anybody who’s come in, like Michael Braun – who was writing that book – came in for a while, within the circle for a while, but then he gets pushed out. ‘Cause, you know, we don’t want him in the inner circle. He’s got to stay on the edges, while the four of us get on with – you know.

(Note: As suggested above, John and Yoko are late to the studio - which is not uncommon, as far as the entire sessions are concerned, but this time no one is even sure they’re going to show up, especially when George isn’t here, and rehearsals aren’t likely to progress. It is later discovered that they had disconnected their phone lines; when they finally get through, after more than a hour, it’s only because John calls the studio first. It may or may not be significant that John calls specifically to speak to Paul - and after speaking with him, decides to come to the studio after all.

It is the popular opinion - and indeed, the members themselves have claimed the same - that George initially quit the band following a tense exchange with Paul. Definitively, however, George actually quit following an unrecorded argument with John; that oft-discussed scene between George and Paul from the Let It Be documentary happened four days before the fact. Which isn’t to say that Paul is any less responsible for George’s emotional state than John is; there had already been years of interpersonal band dynamics before Yoko ever got into the picture. That John was determined not to speak for himself, and considered Yoko’s opinion above George’s in matters related to the band, was probably a tipping point.

Yoko speaking on behalf of John has the further implication of passive-aggressive inaction on John’s part - at this time, he didn’t want to be actively involved in the band anymore; he didn’t want to forfeit his symbolic position as a “leader” of having the final say, but he didn’t want to be the bad guy and call it off, either. Hence the entitled deference and exchangeability and establishment of symbiosis, to oust the old out with the new - until the boat called Paul sank, and he could set sail on the boat called Yoko.)

### She was talking for John

January 13th, 1969 (Twickenham Film Studios, London): During a morning discussion of John and Yoko’s conduct and its unnerving impact on the Beatles, Linda offers her observation of what was (and wasn’t) communicated by John and Yoko during a tense band meeting held the previous night. (Note: Follows shortly after this audio clip. Re: the band meeting, I would recommend listening to that as well as this other audio clip for more context.) 

LINDA: ’Cause I have a feeling that half the stuff Yoko said yesterday isn’t – I mean, she was talking for John, and I don’t think he really believed any of that, you know.

### Two answers: fight her, or accept she’s there

January 13th, 1969: As everyone waits for John and Yoko to arrive at the studio, Paul talks about John’s uncommunicativeness, and how he uses it as a defense to avoid speaking honestly or decisively about his own feelings. While Paul is convinced that Yoko provides something for John that The Beatles (read: Paul) can’t anymore, and hedgingly defends the couple to do what they will, the others suggest John doesn’t really want to sever his partnership with Paul, either.

NEIL: I’d just rather not say anything. It’s one of those situations. 

PAUL: Yeah. [pause] Well, that’s – that’s the trouble you see, there, ‘cause that’s it. It’s like, with our – heightened awareness, the answer is not to say anything, you know. But it isn’t. ‘Cause I mean, we screw each other up totally if we don’t do that. ‘Cause we’re not ready for your heightened… vows of silence. [laughs; hapless] We’re really not! Like, we don’t know what the fuck each other’s talking about, when that – we all just sort of get—

NEIL: I think it’s just between the four of you, that get it. That’s what I’d pretend. 

PAUL: Oh yeah, right, yeah. But you see, that’s it, that’s why John doesn’t say anything. ‘Cause he, you know, he just… There was something the other day, when I said, “Well, what do you think?” And he just stood there and didn’t say anything. And then – and I know exactly why, you know. I mean, I wouldn’t, if… [long pause] Somehow. You know, there’s nothing really much to be said about it. You just – we all just have to do it, and all that, instead of like talking about it. But – but if one of us is talking about it, it’s a drag if the other three aren’t. Because then it sort of throws you off. [inaudible; voice marking tape slate] I mean, we’ve just been talking about it now for a few years, you know. Like this… 

MICHAEL: How long has this been around? Like a year? 

LINDA: But that’s not it, anyway. It’s the four of them just getting together. 

PAUL: [hesitating] But that’s – that’s not far off it, you know. I mean…

LINDA: What?

PAUL: I mean, Yoko’s very much to do with it.

LINDA: Mm.

PAUL: ‘Cause she’s very much to do with it from John’s angle, that’s the thing, you know. And I – the thing is that I – there’s— Again, like, there’s always only two answers. One is to fight it, and fight her, and try and get The Beatles back to four people without Yoko, and sort of ask her to sit down at the board meetings. Or else, the other thing is to just realize that she’s there, you know. And he’s not gonna sort of – split with her, just for our sakes.

And – but then it’s not even so much of an obstacle, then, as long as we’re not trying to surmount it. And while we’re still trying to get over it, it’s an obstacle. [trying] But it isn’t, really. It’s not that bad, you know. They want to stay together, those two. So it’s alright. Let the young lovers stay together. [pause] But it shouldn’t be, “We can’t operate under these conditions, boy. You know, we’re coming out.” It’s like – it feels like we’re striking. That’s what it is. It’s like a strike, ‘cause work conditions aren’t right, you know. But… it’s not that bad. 

MICHAEL: But, he – he knows that, doesn’t he?  

PAUL: John knows that, sure. But he’s—

MICHAEL: Does he talk about it at all?

PAUL: No. But he’s – I mean, he’s— See, we’ve done a lot of Beatles now, we’ve had a lot of Beatles, you know, and we’ve got a lot out of Beatles. So that it – I think John’s saying now that honestly, if it came to a push between Yoko and The Beatles, it’s Yoko, you know. 

MICHAEL: Who’d stay. 

PAUL: Oh, sure. 

MICHAEL: But funny enough, the other day, when we were talking, he said that he really did not want not to be a Beatle. He said he really looked forward – not, you know. Meaning he didn’t want that screwed up. 

PAUL: Hm. [pause; unconvinced] Yeah, but it’s a difficult one, that, you know. 

LINDA: I think in their discussions, though, when as soon as you brought that up, John turned to her and said, “See, I told you.” I think it’s one of those things where he—

PAUL: They do it. They tell each other, you know, when they get back home— 

LINDA: Yeah, but I bet he said to her, you know, “When I write, just sort of go away, when I’m with Paul.” But she said, “Oh, I don’t know…” [trailing off] It’s that kind of thing.

PAUL: [quiet] I don’t know. 

(Note: Paul is certainly right, here, but that doesn’t discredit Linda’s or Michael Lindsay-Hogg’s views. John’s unwillingness to declare the dream is over has as much to do with still wanting Paul to come round to his side, as with John’s own insecurities and preternatural connive. But the breakup is inevitable no matter what anyone does, and John’s reticence is double-edged - with Paul, now desperately overreaching, prime to take the fall either way.)

### I’m all for that, but if it screws everything up

January 13th, 1969: While waiting for John and Yoko to arrive at the studio, Paul explains (to Let It Be director Michael Lindsay-Hogg) why it’s difficult for him to get round to talking to John alone anymore, without Yoko around.

LINDA: I think he’d do it but I don’t think she’d do it.

PAUL: See, but their point is, they’re – they’re trying to be as near together as they can. 

MICHAEL: For their own truth, and everything jazz.

PAUL: Yeah, for everything like – so that if she sits over here, then it’s just slightly less good than if she’s sitting that near, very near to him. And if she’s touching him, then that’s even better, you know. And it’s like that. So that, okay, she’s prepared to sit here, but that’s – then there’s the beginning of the rock down. Then she’ll stay at home the next day, while he comes [to the studio], you know. And they see it like that. They see it that the more that they can stay together – and it’s right, in a way. I – you know. If that’s how you see it, then you can see that it would be a drag for that  for people to start saying, “Well, come to the meeting without her,” you know, “I’d rather talk without her,” ’cause it starts separating you again, from her. Which is like, see, it’s very ideological. Which is, you know, it’s probably how it should be.

MICHAEL: I’m all for that. I mean, if that’s what they want to do. But then if it screws everything up for everybody else, then they’ve got to think about it.

PAUL: [reserved] Well. I don’t know, you know. You see, they – they’d say that the other way, that—

MICHAEL: That you’d have to adjust to them.

PAUL: [weary] —that the other way is true, yeah. You know, that if they do what we want to do, then it might screw it up for them, you know. And they don’t want to be screwed up.

### Tell him he’s on pins and needles

January 13th, 1969 (Twickenham Film Studios, London): After waiting for John (and Yoko) to arrive for over an hour, Neil Aspinall returns to inform Paul that their continued attempts to call John have been unsuccessful. This prompts filmmaker Michael Lindsay-Hogg to make an uncharitable joke about removing Yoko to solve John’s unresponsiveness (John letting Yoko speak for him even during band meetings being one of the topics Paul, Linda, Neil, Ringo, and Michael have been discussing all morning). Paul wonders darkly if John has followed George’s example and gone on strike. (Note: Follows directly after this audio clip.) 

NEIL: Mal’s trying to ring him.

PAUL: Yeah?

NEIL: We found [the phone] engaged.

PAUL: Found engaged?

NEIL: [inaudible] —they have it off the hook. 

PAUL: Mm.

RINGO: Send him a telegram.

LINDA: Tell him [Paul]’s on pins and needles, wondering what’s happened to him. [Paul laughs bleakly] Yeah, I thought of that last night, sending him a telegram.

MICHAEL: Did anybody speak to him last night? Does that—

NEIL: No, it was the same last night.

MICHAEL: Maybe if [Yoko] stayed in the black bag, that would count as— [inaudible; drowned out by voice marking tape slate] But not talking. [laughs] Putting that lid on the parrot’s cage. [long pause; Paul whistling; Michael sighing]

PAUL: … And then there were two. [laughs]

### Writing a song with him is a bit embarrassing

January 13th, 1969: As Paul and Neil Aspinall discuss John and Yoko’s persistently conjoined state and how difficult it is to speak with John on a personal level, Paul brings up a failed attempt to write ‘I Will’ alone with John - and Yoko. While Paul contends that Yoko didn’t interfere with them at all, he admits that the very fact of her being there affected his ability to work and engage with John. Deflecting, Paul maintains that he is no position to tell John what he can or can’t do within their partnership, and explains that they’ve been falling out of tandem with each other since The Beatles stopped touring. (Note: This dialogue follows directly after this post.)

LINDA: I don’t know, but that’s what I—

NEIL: Yes, I think a lot of people get to have the impression that whenever John talks these days, it’s like, oh – Yoko’s talking to [for] him.

PAUL: Yeah. 

NEIL: Or he shuts up, and that’s it, he doesn’t do it for you. And then that becomes a dream. [inaudible]

PAUL: Sure. 

NEIL: Not ever, like, talking to him – like I’m talking to you now. Like now I’m talking to Paul, I’m not talking to Linda. 

PAUL: Right. 

NEIL: But when you’re talking to John, you always – these days, anyway – tend to think that you’re talking to Yoko more than you’re talking to John. And that’s when it becomes a drag. 

PAUL: [furtive] That’s why I say writing a song with him is a bit embarrassing, because I do think it sort of – I mean, I start examining my motives, with Yoko there… And it’s probably silly of me! It’s probably silly, because like, Yoko’s not what we’re all sort of thinking she is. 

NEIL: You see, I wouldn’t mind if she would just… wouldn’t say as much. Otherwise.

PAUL: [weary] Well, that – of course that would be great, you know.

NEIL: [laughs; bleak] Yeah. ‘Cause I just feel that it’s like – it’s you and John that are writing the songs together. You know, I mean, I’m not, I’m not— [inaudible; Linda’s and Ringo’s voices]

PAUL: Yeah. 

NEIL: It’s just like, that – she’d start interjecting that you’d… hurt him, and—

PAUL: Yeah, no, she would—

NEIL: But you know, she probably wouldn’t—

PAUL: No, she isn’t—

NEIL: But that’s – you know.

PAUL: Yeah, see, that’s the thing. The only one time we’ve actually done it, she’s agreed. She really is alright. It’s like, it’s the thought of her being there when some of—  [faltering] And then you don’t talk to John, so then he doesn’t talk to you, you know. And it’s like, you can screw it up just as much because she’s there, as – as John’s relying on her because she’s there. So that’s the thing. You know, but I mean, like, you’ll notice, if John – if you’re onto a beam with John about something, then he really isn’t, you know, he really won’t let Yoko talk about it. Because he knows when you’re on a beam, and he knows about it, and you’ll – you can talk straighter to him.

But it’s like, we did ‘I Will’. We tried, we were trying to get the last verse to ‘I Will’, and eventually I just ended up doing it, because it – we couldn’t actually do it. [pause; trying] But – I mean, Yoko really tried to stay out of it, [and] just sort of – got on with something, but she just really… you know. They’re onto that thing. They just want to be near to each other. So I just think it’s just silly of me, or of anyone, to try and say to him, “No, you can’t,” you know. It’s like, ‘cause – okay, they’re – they’re going overboard about it, but John always does! And Yoko probably always does. So that’s their scene. You can’t go saying – you know, “Don’t go overboard about this thing. Be sensible about it. Don’t bring it to meetings.” It’s his decision, that. It’s – it’s none of our business, to start interfering in that. Even when it comes into our business, you still can’t really say much, unless – except, “Look, I don’t like it, John.” And then he can say, well, “Screw you,” or, “I like it,” or, “Well, I won’t do it so much,” or blablabla. Like, that’s the only way, you know. To tell John about that. 

MICHAEL: Have you done that already? 

PAUL: Well, I told him I didn’t like writing songs… with him and Yoko. 

MICHAEL: Were you writing much more before she came around—?

PAUL: Oh yeah, sure. 

MICHAEL: Or had you – cooled it a bit, then? Before her.

RINGO: Before Yoko got there.

PAUL: [restrained] Yeah, cooled it, cooled it. Sure. We’d cooled it because… not playing together. Ever since we didn’t play together—

MICHAEL: Onstage, you mean. 

PAUL: Yes. With the band. Because we lived together, and we played together. We were in the same hotel, up at the same time every morning, doing this all day. And this – I mean, this, you know, it doesn’t matter what you do, [but] just as long as you’re this close all day, something grows, you know. In some ways. And when you’re not this close, only, just physically… something goes. 

MICHAEL: Right.

PAUL: So then you can come together to record, and stuff, but you still sort of lose the… [hesitating] Actually, musically, you know, we really – we can play better than we’ve ever been able to play, you know. Like, I really think that. I think, like – [laughs; bleak] we’re – we’re alright on that. It’s just that – being together thing, you know. 

(Note: Projections abound. Also note that John and Paul had in the past written several songs together in the crowded witness of rowdy tour vans, studios, et al, with no difficulty whatsoever - making Paul’s indefinable unease with Yoko’s presence all the more curious for what it implies. In direct relation to John, whatever Paul recognises of himself and his feelings is reflected back at him by Yoko, forcing him to confront these feelings in an explicitly manifested form. Paul’s consequent inability to write in the face of the matter is no wonder, then - especially for a musician whose lifelong efficiency in the writing process relies on steering very well clear of any introspective navel-gazing. And whose most arguably expressive lyrics are ingenuous efforts directed towards someone other than himself.

It is unspecified when this particular writing session for 'I Will’ took place, but if John, Paul, and Yoko were entirely on their own, sans engineers, producers, etc., it is possible it occurred in Paul’s house, where John and Yoko were residing for a time in 1968. 

As for what Paul and Neil are intimating about earlier on, and whether they’re only speculating from their impression of how Yoko feels about John and Paul’s partnership, or actually recalling something said outright in a past incident - my guess is as good as yours. It seems to echo Yoko’s cruelly-timed 1981 comment to Philip Norman: “John said that no one ever hurt him the way Paul hurt him.”) 

### Yoko talked for John

January 13th, 1969: As everyone waits for John and Yoko to arrive at the studio, Paul talks disconsolately about John’s evasiveness, and how John’s habit of using Yoko as his mouthpiece drove George to walk out of a band meeting the previous day. Linda, Neil Aspinall, and Let It Be filmmaker Michael Lindsay-Hogg share their thoughts.

MICHAEL: But do you think if you put any, uh, pressure on him, that he’d – go your way a bit more?

PAUL: [guarded] Who’s this?

MICHAEL: John.

PAUL: I don’t know. [long pause] But I don’t know, you know, I can’t… [quiet] I just can’t be bothered doing all that.

MICHAEL: Hm. [awkward] Hm. [silence; fidgeting]

PAUL: [tired] Do you want to try and ring John? [long pause]

NEIL: Mal or I can do it.

PAUL: Try him.

LINDA: The thing is, the four of you. The four of them just talking. 

MICHAEL: Did you – did you not talk about it much, last night?

LINDA: Well, there was just too many…

NEIL: People.

LINDA: Mm.

PAUL: John didn’t talk. You see, Yoko talked… for John.

MICHAEL: Did George stay?

PAUL: Oh, well, then – in the middle of all that, actually—

LINDA: Hopefully. [Linda thought Michael was asking if George, who quit the band on January 10th, had decided in the meeting to stay in The Beatles.]

PAUL: George went. You know, “See ya.”

LINDA: But he was waiting for it to stop, you know. That’s why he was stepping out. But when he saw it wasn’t… The thing is like – a meeting without Yoko, just once, and she’d—

NEIL: I don’t think we’ll ever get that. [long pause]

PAUL: You see, that’s it, you know.

NEIL: That is.

PAUL: That is a big sort of crunch, that.

NEIL: You’d have to – you’d have to say it to John, then. And then it’s going to be like, “Well, I’m not doing it,” or, “I am doing it,” and whichever way it goes – but at least whenever John decides what he wants with that, that will be that.

### (Lunchtime) I really don’t like to be smothered

January 13th, 1969 (Twickenham Film Studios, London): Over lunch, the remaining Beatles touch on George’s resignation from the band on the 10th, as well as a group meeting held the previous day which ended in less than desirable circumstances (with George leaving the room, frustrated by John’s persistently Yoko-filtered standard of communication). While Yoko contends that it would be easy for John (and Paul) to regain George’s favour, John points out that this is a more deeply-rooted issue than it may seem, compounded over the years by John and Paul’s treatment of George and his defaulted status within the group. Upon this problem of overriding egos, however, Paul suggests (passive-aggressively) that it isn’t just the Lennon-and-McCartney tandem that is causing George upset and consternation. 

PAUL: [bleak; joking] So where’s George?

RINGO: It smells like George is here. 

YOKO: [to John] Well, you can get back George so easily, you know that. You know, Paul and—

JOHN: But it’s not that easy, because it’s a festering wound—

PAUL: Yeah. 

LINDA: Yeah. 

JOHN: —that we’ve allowed to – and yesterday we allowed it go even deeper, but we didn’t give him any bandages. And it’s only because George, uh, when he comes up, when he is that part of him… We have egos. We can’t help but have—

RINGO: Well, it can be a burden on him. 

JOHN: I’ll have, you know—well, look, you do— [inaudible]

RINGO: [inaudible]

PAUL: Rosé.

YOKO: Can I have one too [inaudible]? But if you wanted it badly enough, you have to, you know—

MAL: What do you want, uh, Paul?

PAUL: Rosé, please, for me. Linda?

LINDA: No thank you.

JOHN: [inaudible] I wouldn’t say it’s my ego. It was yesterday, really – or, or even the day before when we went to George’s—

PAUL: I sure as hell know I wouldn’t like you to.

JOHN: What?

PAUL: Dig in your heels.

YOKO: Your ego’s great, by the way. 

PAUL: ’Cause if I’m to – if I’m to look at either of you, you know, I really don’t like to be smothered. You know—

YOKO: No, no no—

PAUL: You know, if I could – if you were in a shop on a shelf, I’d— [inaudible] —or whatever it is—

JOHN: I’m just trying to ask [inaudible] – do I want him back, Paul, I’m just asking, do I want it back? Whatever it is.

### Do I want him back?

January 13th, 1969 (Twickenham FIlm Studios, London): As the problem of George’s current resignation from the band is discussed, John makes it about him and Paul wonders what it’s all worth. (Note: As my transcripts for this tape undergo constant revision and it’s been an ongoing agony trying to determine who is addressing whom about what in reference to whom throughout this tape under a deluge of possible interpretations, this fragment - which follows right after this previous post - is about all I’m confident with sharing at the moment.) 

JOHN: I’m just trying to ask [inaudible] – do I want him back, Paul, I’m just asking, do I want it back? Whatever it is. [Do I want it back] Enough?

YOKO: Right, do you want this, to have George back, you have [inaudible]—

JOHN: Then if it is enough, I’d have to swallow my ego for you, I’d have to smother me jealousy for you—

PAUL: Mm. 

JOHN: —to carry on for whatever reasons there is. 

### I’ve always played that one

January 13th, 1969 (Twickenham Film Studios, London): John contends with how the force of his partnership with Paul and his relationship with Yoko has negatively affected George and perhaps directly contributed to George’s walkout on the group three days prior. (Note: Follows shortly after this clip. My apologies for the vagueness; this is a very difficult excerpt to interpret, and I change my mind about it constantly, as the emotional nuances of what is being conveyed shift significantly depending on whom you presume John is speaking to (Paul or Yoko) about whom (Paul, George, or Yoko) and whom it is in reference to or is directed towards (Paul, George, or Yoko), word to word. I did initially try to indicate who’s who in brackets next to the relevant pronouns, but the transcript got dreadfully cluttered, and as I said, I have hardly nailed myself to a mast. Basically, this is a fannish Rorschach test and Your Mileage May Vary.)

JOHN: And it’s just that, you know. It’s only this year that you’ve suddenly realised, like who I am, or who he is, or anything like that. But the thing is—

PAUL: But I still haven’t realised that. What I’m – the process.

YOKO: [inaudible]

JOHN: Yeah yeah, but you realise that some – like you were saying, like George was some other part. But up till then, you’d had a – your thing that carried you forward. [pause; Yoko speaking?] I know, I’d adjusted before you. Alright, that would make me hipper than you, but I know that I’d adjusted to you before that – for selfish reasons, and for good reasons, not knowing what else to do, and for all these reasons. I’d adjusted to all these and allowed you [inaudible] – you know, if you wanted to let me— [inaudible] —very, very… whatever it is. But this year, you’ve seen, you’ve seen what you’ve been doing, and what everybody’s been doing, and not only did we feel guilty about it, the way we all feel guilty about our relationship to each other, because we could do more… 

YOKO: [inaudible]

JOHN: I know, the thing is that I’m – I can’t – I’m not putting any blame on you for only suddenly realising it, see, because it’s [inaudible] our game, you know; it might have been masochistic, but the goal was still the same, self-preservation. And I knew what I liked about that. I know where the – even if I didn’t know where I was at, you know, the table’s there, and… let him do what he wants, and George too, you know…

PAUL: I know. I know—

JOHN: And I have won.

PAUL: But this thing has been—

JOHN: But I think you—

PAUL: You have—

JOHN: I feel it’s you.

PAUL: Whatever it is, you have. Yeah, I know. Well, I’ve had [inaudible]—

JOHN: Because you – ’cause you’ve suddenly got it all, you see.

PAUL: Mm.

JOHN: I know that, because of the way I am, like when we were in Mendips, like I said, “Do you like me?” or whatever it is. I’ve always – uh, played that one.

PAUL: [laughs nervously] Yes.

JOHN: So.

PAUL: Uh, I’d been watching, I’d been watching. I’d been watching the picture.

YOKO: Go back to George. What are we going to do about George?

JOHN: Yeah, I’m – yeah, sure. But this year, suddenly, it’s all happened to you, and you sort of go – you’re taking the blame, suddenly, as if, uh… Oh, he’d say, “Oh yeah, you know [inaudible],” as if I’ve never known it. And then he thought, “Fucking hell. I know what he’s like. I know he used to kick people. I know how he connived with Len, Ivan. I know him, you know? Fuck him.” And then, oh, but, but right, I’ve done such things… all that. So you’ve taken the five years that [inaudible], you’ve taken the five years of trouble, this year. So half of me says, alright, you know I’ll do anything to save you, to help you. And the other half of me says, well serves him fucking right. I’ve chewed through fucking shit because of him for five years, and he’s only just realised what he was doing [to her?]. So, and that’s something – we’ve both known it, you know? [laughs] And it is incredible. [pause]

PAUL: Yeah.

### Like you joining the band instead of Pete

January 13th, 1969 (Twickenham Film Studios, London): During a discussion on how the rest of the group should move forward after George’s departure on the 10th, John wonders if they should get George back at all, suggesting his role as a Beatle is replaceable (unlike his own or Paul’s), and likens this unkindly to how Ringo first replaced Pete Best. Paul notes that John has been the top buck in getting himself heard (and getting his way) since the inception of the group (which John protests) and quickly reassures Ringo when he wryly declares himself to be little more than rabbit food for the group.

Paul admits that both he and John have done one over on George, albeit unconsciously as an effect of the competition and unaware of how it may have hurt George in the process, but John argues that he’s known since early childhood how manipulative he himself can be, and has tried to curb it to little avail.

PAUL: See, I’m just assuming he’s coming back, you know. I tell you, I’m just assuming he’s coming back.

RINGO: If he wants—

JOHN: What if he isn’t?

PAUL: If he isn’t, then… if he isn’t, then it’s a new problem.

RINGO: He would like the four of us to sit down.

JOHN: It’s like we’ve said—

PAUL: Yeah.

RINGO: He wants the four of us to actually—

JOHN: See, if we want it – if we do want it, I still won’t tour, man, but I do want to—

PAUL: But you seem to – you seem to think—

JOHN: But if we do end up deciding we want it, as a policy, I can go along with that. Because the policy has kept us together.

RINGO: But the thing is that if we want him—

JOHN: If we want him, because we want him – but the thing is, like George said, it’s that The Beatles, to me, isn’t just limited to the four of us. I think that I, alone, could be a Beatle. [to Paul] I think you could. [to Ringo] I’m not sure whether you could, because you’re doing… Well, like, but I’m just telling you what I think! I don’t think The Beatles revolve around the four people! It might be like a job—

PAUL: But you know what, John, I’ll tell you one thing—

JOHN: [to Ringo] It’s like you joining the band instead of Pete. It’s like – to me, it is like that.

PAUL: Tell you what— [inaudible] Let me tell you what I think. [pause; inaudible] —thing is this. [to John] You have always been at the front of the chute. Now, there have been some secondary rungs, but George has been third rung—

RINGO: And I’ve been the cabbage.

PAUL: [immediately] Never.

JOHN: [dismissive] No, we haven’t—

PAUL: No, just, no – listen here. You’re the rabbit, he’s right.

JOHN: But not always, though—

PAUL: [anxious] No, listen here – listen – always! But! But! [pause] I do think – no, I do think that as grim as it all is, that [George]’s right. And I do think that like our sole approach is exactly what he’s been saying. And that our brains sort of… con him. It’s all nothing. I do think that is a – I mean— [stumbling] As a first way out, I can’t really even say that, but I do think, you know, that when you get right down to it—

JOHN: Yes.

PAUL: ’Cause the moments of clarity, that I’ve just been – are just so innocent, and so simple, that all my connive, and all my – urge, or— [inaudible]

JOHN: But don’t give me like – ’cause I’ve at least been aware of my conniving since fourteen. Real aware of it.

PAUL: Sure.

JOHN: And before that. You realize that I’ve known I’ve been conniving from – from Dovedale, you know that. I’ve been aware of that. Just because – I don’t know whether it’s him. It’s not him. It’s just me. That I’ve realized where it’s nowhere – but the thing is, I only know where it is when I’m in the middle of all of it—

PAUL: Yeah.

JOHN: —that I am sort of at it again. And that’s why I’ve had to fight for the last three years. And I’ve done it – the other way. Just – rather than allow myself to connive, I thought, “Stop it now. Stop it.”

### I want you all for whatever you are

January 13th, 1969 (Twickenham Film Studios, London): In the middle of a personal discussion with John and Ringo about the band, its tenuous future, and their relationships with one another, Paul (in response to John’s admission of insecurity in the face of external pressures from the public and media to perform) is emphatic about his faith in them and their abilities and contends that whatever interpersonal problems they have can be resolved, for what their music is worth. (Note: I am sheepishly and frustratedly uncertain of my transcription. And yes, Yoko and Linda seem to be having a fascinating conversation about Paul and George.)

PAUL: [trying] If all of you were for sale on a shop, I’d want you as, you know, that, but I really don’t want you as that!

JOHN: Yes.

PAUL: But I want you as that! I don’t want him as that. You see, I want you to want yours. You’re [inaudible]. Ringo wanted— When I say those things, you know, I can hear myself sort of – but I don’t know what it is you want me to do! In period and in fact, I want you all for whatever you are. Because I’m placing it – after all the bests, and all it bloody does, and what’s best, is that what you are is alright. Because if it isn’t, then it’s just stupid of me [inaudible], you know? Because it’s what you are, and I would [inaudible] anywhere! So I’m placing all the money, all the fame, and everything, on what you are. So if this is what you two are, then get on with it.

### It doesn’t give me the same satisfaction anymore

January 13th, 1969 (Twickenham Film Studios, London): While Yoko and Paul conduct their own conversation with each other, Linda talks to John about the inevitable difficulties any relationship faces - even in the context of a musical partnership - and why it doesn’t prove the relationship itself is an expired one. John (inexplicably or not) laments the the White Album doesn’t sound like the genuine, inspired band collaboration they achieved in the past. 

LINDA: You were saying that—

JOHN: [pained] It’s like George said. It just doesn’t give me the same sort of satisfaction anymore. Because of the compromise we’d have to make, to be together. [long pause] You know, it’s that the end result of the records now aren’t… enough. Because now, we – we know it so clearly, how we arrived at it, and for what it was and all. Before, it was always a surprise when we – you know. We weren’t so aware of how we reacted to it. When the – something came out, like Revolver or Pepper or whatever, there was still that element of surprise that we didn’t know where it came from. But now we know exactly where it came from, and how we arrived at that particular noise, and how it could have been… much better. Or it needn’t have been at all. The only way to do it – satisfactory, for y– yourself – is to do it on your own. And then that’s fucking hard.

LINDA: But you were saying yesterday, you know. And you know something, you – you’ve always been sort of thinking that it can’t be any better than it was; you’re not just a studio musician. You always say it. I mean, [inaudible] – I’m saying, hey, you make good music together. And you like it or not, you know.

JOHN: [furtive] I like it.

LINDA: And making good music is also—

JOHN: But it’s just—

LINDA: It’s really hard working at a relationship.

JOHN: I – I know.

LINDA: Of course! That’s what you said yesterday. It happens all the time, you know. And you also said you wanted [inaudible] The Beatles—

JOHN: It’s like all of us are dissatisfied with The Beatles LP. Now, it’s not because the way we got on doing it, because the end result was – was as good as it could’ve been. And – I don’t know what the reason could be. [offhand] Mal, could you get a little glass of wine?

MAL: Yeah. Red, or—?

JOHN: If I get down to my contributions, then I’m satisfied, you know. But the whole thing is less satisfactory.

RINGO: But I enjoy it more.

JOHN: But individually. Name any of them! There is no [inaudible]. Even George’s numbers are more satisfactory than any numbers we’ve done before. But as a whole thing, it’s just not satisfactory to me.

RINGO: Well, I mean, I dig it far more than Sgt. Pepper or anything—

LINDA: You know, it really—

JOHN: And I dig it too. I dig it, individually, far more than Sgt. Pepper. But as a whole – as a Beatles thing, I think it didn’t – it couldn’t work as a Beatles thing. I think it’s one of the best Beatles work we could have, you know, but as a – as an entity, as a whole coming out of all of us here – no.

### You’re unsure whether to go left or right

January 13th, 1969 (Twickenham Studios, London): As Paul encourages an unconfident Ringo to go ahead with his plans to record a solo LP, John hedgingly brings up his own apprehensions about following his instincts (especially when he’s not even sure what he really wants to do). In their inimitable and emotionally non-committal fashion, John and Paul engage in metaphors about intentions, conveying these intentions in actions, and how these actions may be conveyed by those who see it. (Basically: what John and Paul talk about when they talk about love.)

PAUL: [to Ringo] The great thing is that you singing like how you really sing – will be it. It will be! 

RINGO: Yes, but the only way is to do it on your own. 

PAUL: Until then – yeah, sure. Until then – until you reach how you really sing, you’ll sing your half-soul. 

RINGO: Yeah. 

PAUL: And it’s probably when we’re all very old, that we’ll all sing together. 

RINGO: Yeah.

PAUL: And we’ll all really sing, and we’ll all show each other how good we are, and in fact we’ll die, then, I don’t know. [Linda laughs; diffident] Probably, you know, probably something sappy or soft like that… I don’t know, but really, I mean, i– it’s really down to all those sort of simple, silly things to me. 

YOKO: But those are the important things, you know. 

PAUL: It’s got to be simple. It’s got to be simple. It can’t be A plus B equals X plus Y plus Z, because that’s them, you know. And it couldn’t be— 

JOHN: [quiet] Maybe that’s what’s evading me. 

PAUL: Yes. [sincere] But it’s okay, that, you know. 

JOHN: [hesitating] I just, uh… because I’m not really sure what or how I feel about it. 

PAUL: No, but you’re—

JOHN: Because any time— 

PAUL: You’re unsure because you’re not sure whether to go left or right on an issue. You’ve noticed the two ways open to us. You know the way we all want to go. And you know the way you want to go. Which is positive! ‘Cause you want to go – now, okay. So your positive thing might actually be to kick that telephone box in. It might occasionally be to do that. So you know that’s the way you’ve gotta go.  

YOKO: Everybody would want to see that, actually.

PAUL: But you don’t want to actually look like you’re kicking the telephone box in. So you have to sort of say to everyone, “Look at that over there, everyone!” And while they’re not looking, you’ll kick the telephone box in, and sort of— [whistles innocently] 

JOHN: I don’t think that’s a fair representation. [laughs] 

PAUL: [conceding] Oh, well, it involves me, that’s me. I do that, too. And I think we all do that. But I think the answer is, that – while you’ve got us all looking at nothing over there, and you’ve thrown us for a minute, we would actually all have dug to see you kick that telephone box in.  Because we wanna see you do it. 

YOKO: But we’d have to say it too, though. That’s another thing. 

PAUL: We would actually want to watch the Steve McQueen film, where he kicks the telephone box in. We all want to see that. You know. And I really think that’s—

YOKO: Yes, but sometimes it’s very—

JOHN: But it must be our own faults, that we’ve built it up that I can’t kick the telephone box – apart from it being my fault— 

PAUL: You can. You could. 

JOHN: But – the feeling that, that – that I – like Ringo said about his album, that what – we’re – you know. I won’t do it, ‘cause I’m gonna let us down, or – look a fool. 

PAUL: Yeah.

JOHN: You know, and we’ve each done that to each— [audio glitch] That bit. 

PAUL: We all know we can do that, you know. I mean, I’m really trying to sort of learn, really— [inaudible] —meaning.

JOHN: Well, it’s like – we’ve all found – we can do it on our own. 

PAUL: But on our own, I’m just gonna have to sort of just say it to you all. Through the song. Now I know if I – when I’m saying to you all, “Listen, this is how this song goes,” you know, then I know if I half-tell you how it goes, that there’ll be two of you who’ll like it, and then there’s only [inaudible]. You know. 

JOHN: Yeah. 

PAUL: A certain amount of you will like it, and some of you won’t. Because, and I know – and you know, this is where it gets heavy. Because you’ve got to blame yourself, for that. Because I know I half-sang it. 

JOHN: Yes. 

PAUL: And I know that if – say I’m pissed, at the end of an evening, and I just, and I get on a piano because I really just want to get on a piano. And I’m singing because I don’t particularly want to show off, too. I want to really sing this song, now, and say what I wanna say, and so on and so on and so on. I’ll do it, and everyone in that room will dig it, because it’s me really doing it. And I know that we all have this. [inaudible] And everyone will be really crazy about it. Now if I were really doing it, everyone will listen, and everyone will dig it, and no one will go against it. It’s when I half-mean it, or it’s when I nearly mean it, but there’s – there’s always that one person that can spot that – that—

JOHN: Yeah.

PAUL: Spot them doing a mistake. You know, there’s always someone who can spot that little bit where Charlie Chester didn’t quite mean it, or Charlie Drake, when he didn’t quite mean the joke. You know, it’s all in that.

YOKO: But then sometimes it doesn’t matter to you, so. 

PAUL: It’s like if we could really… See, that’s why I think this is where we’ve got a problem now, you know.

(Note: Significant - and frustrating, and hilariously sad - in hindsight, for reasons that are obvious. Paul: “I’m telling you to leave me in the hopes that you’ll tell me you won’t, because it’ll prove you still care about me and want to stay.” John: “I’m telling you I’m moving on in the hopes that you’ll tell me not to, because it’ll prove you still care about me and want me to stay.”)

### How much more have I done towards helping you write?

January 13th, 1969 (Twickenham Film Studios, London): John and Paul have an obfuscating conversation about their songwriting partnership and creative process, which has been incapacitated by a lack of direction, misplaced (misread) intentions, and the unmet (unrealised) expectations they’ve inflicted upon each other. (In other words: issues. And some projecting of issues onto George, for good measure.)

PAUL: That’s why I think this – we’ve got this problem now, you know. What I’d like to do, is for the four of us – and you know, we’ve all have done [inaudible] things – to different degrees, I see it as you go one way, you go one way, George goes one way, and me another. But I know it will apply to all us, if one day, we can all be singing like we’re singing, [to Ringo] you can be drumming like you’re drumming, George can be really playing – I mean, like he plays, not as if I’m trying to make him play like me. But now it’s like I keep trying to make him play like – how I’ve played guitar—

JOHN: But you don’t, you see. The point – the point that we both – or, mainly me—

PAUL: Back up, back up.

JOHN: Yeah, okay. Is that you try and make George play… competently, because you’re afraid that how he’ll play won’t be like you want him to play. And that’s what we did. And that’s what you did to me. [pause]

PAUL: Yeah.

JOHN: And – I – that’s the difference with you saying that the competen— [audio glitch] —so annoyed by the conniving on The Beatles album, was that I’d—

PAUL: Yeah.

JOHN: I got to a bit where I thought – it’s no good, me telling you what or how to do it, you know? All I tried to do on that album was just sing it to you like I was drunk, you know.

PAUL: Yeah.

JOHN: Just did me best to say, “Look, this, this stands up on its own.”

PAUL: Yeah.

JOHN: And I’m not doing this quite well, ‘cause I – like even with ‘Don’t Let Me Down’, the first time I sang it. Because I hadn’t allowed meself to say it, as a whole song.

PAUL: Yeah.

JOHN: I couldn’t work – it was only after we’d done it that I’d realised  it was done. You know, and on The Beatles album, I just sort of said, “[inaudible] This is me singing it drunk, but I’m pretending as if I’m not. What would you do with it?”

PAUL: [laughs] Drunk.

JOHN: You know? “George, you play whatever you like.”

PAUL: Yeah.

JOHN: You know, and that’s what it was. It wasn’t – it wasn’t the arrogance of, “Listen. This is it, baby.” It was that – I can’t tell you what to do because you won’t play, here, like how I think you should play.

PAUL: Yeah, right.

JOHN: And—

PAUL: You see, that’s – that’s the thing.

JOHN: I’m not going to tell you what to play—

PAUL: That seems to be the trouble, is that—

YOKO: It is. [pause]

PAUL: Okay. And that’s great, you know. And then – it’s just that being able to say that, on the occasion. I just mean to say, “Look, I’m not going to say anything about the song, because – really, I’m going to really try, now—”

JOHN: But we tried it—

PAUL: “—to sing it to you—”

JOHN: [exasperated] Yeah, I know, but you wouldn’t say—

PAUL: Listen to me— [inaudible]

JOHN: We arranged it, you know?

PAUL: I know, I know.

JOHN: You can’t see— Listen, uh, you— [inaudible]

PAUL: I say that, of course, when [inaudible] when you say that to me, because I haven’t got it off of you.

JOHN: Yeah, but the point is you—

PAUL: And you’ve sort of – I think—

JOHN: Well, I’m saying that ‘Dear Prudence’ is arranged. Can’t you hear bom, bom, bom, bom, bom…?

PAUL: Yeah.

JOHN: That – that is the arrangement, you know.

PAUL: Yeah, well.

JOHN: But I’m too frightened to say “This is it,” I just sit there and say, “Look, if you don’t come along, and play your bit, I won’t do the song,” you know? I can’t do any better than that. Don’t ask me for what boogie you’re gonna play on it.

PAUL: Yeah.

JOHN: Because… apart from not knowing, I can’t tell you better than you have, what grooves you can  play on it. You know, I just can’t work. I can’t do it like that. ‘Course I could, you know! But when you think of the other half of it, just think: how much more have I done towards helping you write? I’ve never told you what to sing, or what to play.

PAUL: Yeah.

JOHN: You know, I’ve always done the numbers like that. Now, the only regret, just for the past numbers, is when – because I’ve been so frightened, that I’ve allowed you to take it somewhere where I didn’t want—

PAUL: Yeah.

JOHN: —and then – my only chance was to let George [audio glitch] take over, or interest George in it, because I knew he’d—

PAUL: Like ‘She Said, She Said’?

LINDA: Yes, yes.

JOHN: ‘She Said, She Said’. Then he’d – he’d– ’cause he’d take it as is. You know? [inaudible; drowned out by voice marking] So on that last album— [inaudible] —arrangements on it— [inaudible] —it’s probably George, you know. If there’s anything wrong with it. Because I don’t want your arrangement on it. I only want your… If you give me your suggestions, let me reject them, or in the case there’s one I like – it’s when we’re writing songs.

PAUL: Mm.

JOHN: The same goes for the arrangement. I don’t want it – to… [sighs] I don’t know.

PAUL: No, I know. I know what you mean, yeah.

YOKO: I know exactly what you mean.

PAUL: Yeah, yeah—

JOHN: I want it to be like I’m just doing it, but— [audio cuts off]

### I don’t hear any of the flutes playing

January 13th, 1969 (Twickenham Studios, London): In the midst of a personal discussion about working together within the band, John tries to explain the disconnect in their process, and why he can’t envision their songs the way Paul can. As both John and Paul circle around the issues of honest communication and (living up to) each other’s expectations, they eventually project onto George bring George into the quandary of the Lennon-McCartney partnership. 

JOHN: And that’s all I did on the last album was say, “Okay, Paul, you’re out to decide where my songs are concerned, arrangement-wise.” [exasperated] I don’t know the songs, you know. I’d sooner just sing them, than have them turn into – into ‘Mr. Kite’, or anything else, where— I’ve accepted the problem from you that it needs arrangement. And then, because I’m an ape, I don’t know. I don’t see any further than me, the guitar, and the drums, and – and George Martin doing the— [audio glitch] I don’t hear any of the flutes playing, you know? I suppose I could hear ‘em if I sat down and worked very hard! I could turn out a mathematical drawing if you’d like, but I could never do it off me own backside, I always have to just – [brushing sound from strumming motion] do that, you know?

PAUL: Yeah. 

JOHN: I mean— 

PAUL: [quiet] Yeah. Yeah. [pause] I’m onto the same thing, you know. That’s – that’s – we’re all at that. It is only, like, if you can just remember that we’re – you know. That the four of us are trying to do that. Because I mean, all of those things you say, you know, in some way, apply to me. Not all ways—

JOHN: Yes, yes, because everything applies a little bit to you, too.

PAUL: [inaudible] —it is just you saying it. They’re all – you know, in some way, to some degree, will apply to me. 

JOHN: ‘Cause once there was a period where none of us could actually, uh, say anything, about your criticisms. 

PAUL: [quiet] Yeah. Yeah.

JOHN: [bleak] ‘Cause you would reject it all.

PAUL: [quiet] Yeah, sure. 

JOHN: And so George and I would just go – you know, “I’ll give you a line here,” “Okay,” you know, “We’ll do four in a bar, and I’ll do…” And a lot of the times you were right.

PAUL: Yeah. 

JOHN: But a lot of the times you were – [the songs were] the same as they always are. But I can’t see the answer to that.

PAUL: No, but – no, that’s good you see. The thing is, like, within each other, within ourselves, we reach something that’s nearly perfect. And everyone else who’s listening will think, “That’s it. They’ve got it.” You know – you know what I mean. So okay, we know we nearly made it, but we’ve really made it, for everyone else. ‘Cause it’s okay, we’re into the fine, finest, finest technicalities – I mean, that’s where it’s at, you know. If one day, we can even keep all – if all the people who are listening to this, nearly nearly made it, they’ll think we’ve made it, you know. They’ll think that’s it. So okay, if we can nearly, if we can creep up on it – and that’s, see, that’s what I’m trying to do. Like last week, yesterday [inaudible] doing alright for me, I was really trying to just say to George, “Take it there,” you know, whereas I wouldn’t have gone [inaudible] and said, “Take it there – with diddle-a-diddle-a-da.” But I was trying last week, to say, “Now, take it over there, and it needs to be like – but, oh, what, like, whatever you—”

JOHN: You see, the point is now – George – is we both did that to George, this time.

PAUL: Mm.

JOHN: And because of the build up to it, that – now he can’t even take that. 

PAUL: Treating him a bit like a mongrel, yeah. 

JOHN: He can’t even – you know. [audio glitch] It’s like if I say, “Alright, take it,” he’ll say, “Well, look, I can’t take it. I’ll forget it.”

PAUL: Yeah…

JOHN: I have to, uh—

PAUL: ‘Cause he knows what we’re all about.

JOHN: Yeah.

PAUL: So he knows that when we say, “Take it,” we expect doo-doo-duh-duh-doo. If I said that, then you’d expect—

JOHN: But it’s just that bit. The bit where we’ve – ‘I’ve Got A Feeling’.

PAUL: Yeah.

JOHN: We – there’s no way we could have translated it to him, to say… you know. 

## 1/14

### ‘The Back Seat Of My Car’

January 14th, 1969 (Twickenham Film Studios, London): Paul plays work-in-progress ‘The Back Seat Of My Car’ for the first time in the studio.

### It’s just for you that I sing this song each morning

January 14th, 1969 (Twickenham Film Studios, London): Paul sings a song he’s written (or is simply improvising on the spot) in the spirit of Johannes Brahms’ ‘Hungarian Dance No. 4′ (and which was quite probably inspired by the 1947 film Song of Love, which features the piece). 

PAUL: It’s just for you that I sing this song of winter / It’s just for you that I sing a song of spring / And every time the raindrops fall I think of summer / It’s just for you that I sing a song of love. 

### Disillusioned by the church

January 14th, 1969 (Twickenham Film Studios, London): While John and Yoko are being interviewed by CBC, a bored Paul decides to have a go at climbing the chain/rope equipment in the studio. Ringo and Mal do likewise. When John and Yoko return, Paul encourages John to have a go as well; John bemoans that he’s too old, and starts in on interviewing Paul and Ringo in a humorous imitation of the interview he just had. (Note: John and Yoko return at around the 8:05 mark, for those who’d prefer to skip all the banter and faffing about with equipment.)  

PAUL: Okay, John. Right up the chains, to the top. 

JOHN: Alright, Paul!

PAUL: Come on, son, you can do it, son, I know you can do this, lad. [John attempts to climb] 

YOKO: John…

PAUL: My money’s on him. [John presumably falls] See! [general sounds of sympathy and laughter] 

YOKO: [sweet] You’re not eighteen, you know. 

JOHN: No, no. [high-pitched voice] It’s alright. Don’t worry about a thing, Yoko.

YOKO: He’s not that young anymore, you see. [laughs] 

JOHN: No, I’m not eighteen anymore. I couldn’t do it at bloody twelve, never mind… [Michael presumably helps out; to Michael] You’re so kind. 

MICHAEL: Yeah, I’m courteous. [inaudible] 

JOHN: [pause; formal voice] Now, we were going to discuss, this afternoon, what religion meant to a pop star. And the pop star we’ve chosen is Ringo McCartney. Tell me, McCartney, does religion mean much to you in this present day, with all the trends and the swinging miniskirts that are about? [Yoko laughs] 

PAUL: Fuck all! Fuck all. 

JOHN: Well, I can see that’s he’s been disillusioned by the church in general in his remark of “Fuck all.” 

PAUL: Yeah well I went to, uh, Brighton with the Maharishi. Fuck all it meant to me! 

JOHN: Was it an important step to you?

PAUL: Nothing, nothing. He didn’t groove me. 

JOHN: He didn’t groove.

PAUL: No. 

JOHN: He didn’t smoke pot, by any chance?

PAUL: No. 

JOHN: What about the Reverend Nipples?

PAUL: Not a chance. 

JOHN: Not a chance. [pause] Well, do you like “X”[-rated] films?

PAUL: Yeah. Yeah. Lulu, Barry Ryan, and “X” films. But Maharishi – no. 

JOHN: That was a pretty concisive opinion of the youth of today. Now we’re going on to a rather different group, uh, generation gap, and that’s Tumble Starker! Who’s sitting here. Now, what do you think about mock-Tudor shithouses in Weybridge and places like that? [Yoko laughs]

RINGO: [posh voice] Well, I don’t mind them being in Weybridge. It’s just when they try and put them in London, I think they get in the way of all the traffic.

JOHN: Yes, you’re so right. As you said yesterday, “Neither your arse nor your elbow.”

RINGO: [sage-like] I said that. 

JOHN: I couldn’t – I’d never forget it. Well that’s all for this evening. [hums broadcast theme tune] Hmm hmm hmm, hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm…

### You are definitely inclined towards it

January 14th, 1969 (Twickenham Studios): With George still out of the band, the rest of The Beatles loll around unproductively in the studio. Ringo casually suggests for John and Paul to write together again, just to fill the time. John (being John) answers in the form of a less-than-conspicuous ditty.

RINGO: Yeah, why don’t you get together—

PAUL: [facetious] Yeah, are you interested at all? 

RINGO: —and write a song?

PAUL: [laughs] Really, yeah. 

JOHN: Actually, I’d say I started one last night. It goes something like this. You are definitely inclined towards it… Although sometimes I doubt it… 

YOKO: What are you joking about? [laughs] 

JOHN: Just… doing my new number. 

MAL: Is that the middle eight?

JOHN: That’s the middle – I need a sort of chorus, and an outline. A format, to the, uh— 

PAUL: Common-garde. [general laughter]

### Who’s the fool on the hill, Paul?

January 14th, 1969 (Twickenham Film Studios, London): Hard pressed to work on any new material, the group (sans George, who is still out of the band) talk idly about producer Glyn Johns’ ancestry, the train sets an unrelated production company is preparing for a film inside the studio, and the plans for the next day’s sessions. John and Paul interview each other about their non-existent projects, skirt the issue of John’s health, and communicate in alternations of absurdity and obscurity. (In other words: John and Paul, in approximation of Beckett. Doug Sulpy describes the tone of John’s voice as having “an interesting quality […] as if, wanting to say something serious for a change, he’s forgotten quite how”.) 

JOHN: Who’s the fool on the hill, Paul?

PAUL: John. 

JOHN: [long pause] I’m trying to sell the house. [long pause] When I was young, so much younger than today, I never needed anybody’s help, in any way. But now my life has changed in oh so many ways. A-whop-bop-a-luma… a-lim-bam-boom. [long pause] We should hold some sanctions against George. Very tightly. 

PAUL: Wheat. Coal.

JOHN: Yes. Wheat and coal. Bread loaves. Meat biscuits. Cardboard cut-outs. 

PAUL: You see the Thirty-Minute Theatre? 

JOHN: I did, but in a blue fuzz. But it didn’t get through to me. Nice colour, though. [pause] I had a visit from a hippie family. Wondered why I had so many bedrooms. 

PAUL: [long pause] Were you able to tell them?

JOHN: Oh, yeah. I told them I’ve got a lot of bedrooms because I’ve got too many. And I offered them accommodation in Ireland, which they took up. 

PAUL: [long pause] Let’s crack on. [sighs] 

MICHAEL: Who’s got a match, as opposed to a lighter? 

PAUL: I have. 

JOHN: I have. 

MICHAEL: As opposed to a lighter. 

RINGO: A wooden one?

PAUL: Blue gold?

MICHAEL: A wooden one do, a wooden one not do… thank you. 

PAUL: I wooden wanna… 

MICHAEL: Are you [inaudible] John?

GLYN: [laughs] No, I am not related. 

RINGO: Stratford John?

GLYN: Nope. 

PAUL: Farmer John?

GLYN: Augustus John, apparently. 

MICHAEL: The John. 

GLYN: Rumour has it Augustus John is a grandfather twice removed or something. [laughs] 

MICHAEL: That’s the way with most of us offspring [inaudible]. 

PAUL: [referring to the film equipment] Is that the new trick, the playback speed is up there?

RINGO: They’ve been there for several years. 

PAUL: Still feeding back. [laughs]

MICHAEL: Should we knock off early today or not?

PAUL: Probably, yeah. 

MICHAEL: Should we knock on early tomorrow?

JOHN: Yes, I’ll do that. 

PAUL: Knock on early?

JOHN: Yes, I just uh… was up late, you know. 

PAUL: Yeah?

MICHAEL: At the moment you’re a guest for lunch. 

JOHN: I was sort of stoned and high and watching films and I wouldn’t have made it anyway. And uh… 

PAUL: Check up. 

JOHN: [subdued] Yeah, but it’s not good if – I’m gonna come at ten, I should come at ten, you know.  

PAUL: Up with the dawn, down with the sun. 

JOHN: Mm. 

PAUL: Ringo ever, Eric never. 

YOKO: [referring to the previous night?] It was worthwhile, though, wasn’t it?

JOHN: Oh, it was worthwhile. [Paul and Yoko laugh] 

PAUL: Does he make a lot of fun of you, Yoko?

YOKO: Not enough. [laughs] 

PAUL: Not enough. [John laughs] 

MICHAEL: I think they’re painting the train. They’ll be doing that while – whilst the time we’re here. 

JOHN: We’d better get on before it leaves, then. 

PAUL: Please believe me. I’d hate to miss the train. Oh yeah. [pause] Like the shoes?

YOKO: Is that the fashion?

PAUL: This is the thing now, you know. 

YOKO: Mm. 

PAUL: The next thing. The socks are – the socks are with them, they come with them. 

JOHN: You did introduce oxford bogs, didn’t you? [Paul and Yoko laugh]

PAUL: Yeah, yeah. I am an innovator in many ways. 

JOHN: Well, apart from your part-time work, what are you doing?

PAUL: Well, I do a lot of dramatic work, in and out of the country. 

JOHN: Presently, I’m working on a Welsh TV series called Land for Wecken, in which I appear as a Danish singer of royal blood who turned to folk singing after a disaster in the First World War where the Nazis bombed his house. 

PAUL: Mm. 

JOHN: And he had to move into, uh, Norway I think it was. Why, I was born on the train between Ostograd and Fensborough. 

PAUL: Jamaica?

JOHN: Sometimes. [Ringo laughs] But generally I have a hell of a mi-graine. So I usually take uh, frantic, which usually gets rid of it. It dissolves in half the time, you see. [pause] It gave me a great background for the job I’m doing now. 

MICHAEL: It’s funny – it’s funny, really. The guy said to me, do you mind if they store their trains quietly in the back? And they’ve come totally populated with painters and the rest of them.

JOHN: Now, the one thing you find about – we’re not pushy. 

PAUL: No. 

JOHN: People want to put trains in the middle of our set— 

PAUL: —they get it. 

JOHN: [inaudible]

PAUL: [pause] Yeah. Mind you, we’re not mugs. 

JOHN: Oh no. 

PAUL: Oh no. 

JOHN: [referring to Apple] We gave it all away. It was our plan. 

### All this camp on TV

January 14th, 1969 (Twickenham Film Studios, London): With John, Paul and the others present seemingly loathe to rehearse or work on new material, John improvises a scene based on an earlier discussion about filming a Beatles detective thriller story in the studio. When director Michael Lindsay-Hogg expresses concern about how they should handle George’s walk-out in their proposed documentary of the sessions, John, whom along with Yoko, Paul, and Ringo has been speaking in non-sequiturs and idle thoughts for the past hour, suggests their current inhabitance of boredom would make a far more compelling film. As Yoko returns from making a phone call, John hooks onto the topic of Robert Baden Powell’s dissuasion of masturbation amongst the Boy Scouts.

JOHN: Is Cilla Black? [Paul laughs] Read next week’s TV Times… and you’ll never know. [phone rings coincidentally in the studio] Ah! [Paul laughs; John pretends to hold a phone conversation] Sir Joseph. It’s about this deal with FBI. I need another million and the written acclimation of Dick James. [pause] I know it’s hard, I know it’s hard! But you’re in position to do it, George.

MICHAEL: We were talking, earlier—

JOHN: About the space between us?

MICHAEL: [laughs] About the gap between us. But about also like the documentary, which is grinding to a halt. How we’d do it.

JOHN: Grinding to a halt? I think it’s taking off.

PAUL: [laughs] Taking— Here we go.

JOHN: “Loop the loop,” as Frankie once said, the one-legged wonder.

MICHAEL: Ringo said that he thought we ought to just tell it like it is, which is what I thought, but Mal thought we oughtn’t tell it like it is.

PAUL: I think we are.

MICHAEL: I think we are.

JOHN: Well uh…

MICHAEL: So those are the two camps, you might say, which goes back to the remark you were making earlier about Noël Coward.

JOHN: [facetious] Well I do object to all this camp on TV, including Baden Powell on his foreskin. It’s one of the most upsetting things I’ve ever seen. Discouraging boys from masturbating in case he wets the sheets. [laughter] It’s funny you should say that. [Yoko returns]

YOKO: What are you talking about?

JOHN: I’m talking about the Boy Scouts who aren’t allowed to masturbate.

YOKO: Oh.

JOHN: It’s very tempting when you’re wearing shorts. If they only wore long trousers, maybe they’d stand a chance, you know. But I can tell you, you don’t go blind, but very short-sighted. [uproarious laughter]

YOKO: Are you talking from experience, or just…?

JOHN: From experience. [laughter] I remember during an English lesson, as I came, I suddenly noticed I needed glasses. I thought, “God, they were right.” But I’m not gonna give it up for anything! [Yoko laughs] All the tax I’ve earned. I should coco. [silence] We should dub on a spiritual message of that. [Paul and Yoko laugh]

### No business like no business

January 14th, 1969 (Twickenham Film Studios, London): As the day trudges forth without any productivity for the Beatles’ second day without George in the group, Paul asks John about Two Virgins (under the flippant guise of a journalist) to which John responds with stiff sincerity. As director Michael Lindsay-Hogg comes round to confer, Ringo admits that he isn’t feeling well and wonders about having some rest. Michael commiserates, but expresses concern about the impetus of the group and is worried that they will individually (and indifferently) wander off to their own devices if they don’t have a routine schedule to solder them together as a working band - which prompts John and Ringo to sing a sentimental folk bar. Not being of the disposition to have serious discussions about the direction of the (Get Back/Let It Be) sessions, John, Paul, and Ringo (dis)engage in frivolous wit and references to the Laugh-In.

PAUL: So what’s the point behind Two Virgins? [Yoko laughs]

JOHN: It’s a six-inch nail. [long pause] The main point behind it is to open people’s minds to what’s happening today. There are people all over the country humming into tape recorders, and we hope to bring them out into the open. And hum together. [pause] You understand?

PAUL: Hmm.

JOHN: Now sold one thousand three hundred due to the great promotion from Apple Dietetics.

YOKO: [laughs] Which is a figure you don’t want to expose, necessarily.

PAUL: Is it very neat to do this in public, Mr. Lennon?

JOHN: I feel obliged, in the position that I am today as a pop idol and the power I have, to do something for the good, and uh, I feel obliged to speak out… [pause] And that’s as simple as I can put it, really. Take Downing Street. South Orderly Street. Wimpole Street. All owned by the Queen. ‘Nuff said. [silence; fidgeting]

MAL: [in background] Is anybody – wanna rehearse, or do songs, or—?

YOKO: [inaudible]

RINGO: I feel ill, actually.

MICHAEL: Do you? Was this a mistake [inaudible]?

RINGO: I don’t. [laughter]

JOHN: I think a few days in bed…

RINGO: Yes, I think so too.

JOHN: Or maybe three days on the couch, depending on what your job is.

RINGO: I think two days in bed.

MICHAEL: Do you really not feel well?

RINGO: No, I just feel a bit… ill.

PAUL: [to Michael] Well, do you?

MICHAEL: I don’t feel well, but I can’t say, ‘cause I’m the captain of the ship.

JOHN: Oh you can. [Yoko laughs]

PAUL: Why?

MICHAEL: No, I don’t want to let the crew down.

JOHN: Nowadays, the captain gets off first.

MICHAEL: No, I go down with the ship.

YOKO: [inaudible]

JOHN: No he does, really.

MICHAEL: I feel tired, but I think it’s tiring – disappointing.

JOHN: [bored] Hmm.

MICHAEL: But I have a feeling if we decide not to meet one day, we may never meet again.

PAUL: Well…

JOHN: Along this dusty road…

RINGO: We’ll always meet again…

JOHN: On this dusty road.

YOKO: As they say, there’s no business like no business.

JOHN: Again.

PAUL: Yeah.

YOKO: Again.

PAUL: And still the boom [mic] wasn’t over them.

JOHN: Ooh, the Queen of Sheba wore falsies.

RINGO: [mock-surprise] I didn’t know that!

JOHN: Didn’t you know that? You weren’t there at the time. [pause] Cleopatra was a carpet manufacturer.

RINGO: I didn’t know that!

JOHN: ‘Cause you weren’t there at the time. [pause] Edgar Allen Poe was a shithouse.

RINGO: I didn’t know that!

YOKO: What was John Lennon?

JOHN: A patriot. [Yoko laughs] I didn’t know that. [laughter]

JOHN & PAUL: “Goodnight, Dick.” [laughter]

JOHN: [sighs] That was Lennon and McCartney. Northern Sheds. Great Western Railway.

PAUL: Songs for all functions.

JOHN: Ross-Upon-Wye.

PAUL: Nige-Whalley-Mange.

JOHN: Ilford two, Western Middlodeons – terrible.

### A serious program of work

January 14th, 1969 (Twickenham FIlm Studios, London): As Paul jokingly suggests for the (Let It Be documentary) camera crew to capture Ringo (who isn’t feeling well) if he sicks on the floor, John mentions superficially that he threw up during an interview filmed earlier in the day with Yoko for Canadian television - not from illness, but from recent irresponsible habits, possibly exercised the previous night. Paul, who is wearied by the lethargy of the proceedings, tries to engage John about the recording sessions and how they should work while George is gone, but John palters, and at turns they both fall back on oblique references and emotionally indeterminate allusions.

After John trades bad jokes with Ringo, Paul implores them to remember why they’re here and that they can’t idle forever, and John (seemingly contrite, if nonetheless facile) agrees to start rehearsing. Despite the others’ reservations about his health, a subdued Ringo reassures that he’s staying to play too.

RINGO: Kevin?

PAUL: I think if we hang around a bit longer we can get Ringo being sick. [laughter]

JOHN: You – see, you missed me this morning, I did it for CBS. Just leapt off in the middle of the interview.

PAUL: Did you?

KEVIN: [in background] As a matter of fact, yes.

JOHN: No reason at all, except that I’ve been mistreating my body.

YOKO: I thought it was a happening.

JOHN: It was a happening.

PAUL: There was a lot of nervous tension, you know.

JOHN: Oh, yes.

PAUL: I mean, there was a bloody funny atmosphere in that room, mother.

JOHN: Aye.

MICHAEL: We missed out on the other day.

JOHN: Hmm?

MICHAEL: We missed it the other day, but then they wouldn’t let us have it.

JOHN: They missed it too.

MICHAEL: Oh. Were they in colour or black and white?

YOKO: Colour.

JOHN: I never noticed that. Colour.

PAUL: [trying] See, what we need is a serious program of work. An endeavour. Not an aimless rambling amongst the canyons of your mind. [inaudible] —life.

JOHN: Take me on that trip upon that golden ship of shores… We’re all together, boy.

PAUL: To wander aimlessly is very unswinging. Unhip.

JOHN: And when I touch you, I feel happy inside. I can’t hide, I can’t hide. [pause] Ask me why, I’ll say I love you.

PAUL: What we need is a schedule.

JOHN: A garden schedule.

PAUL: Point A to Z. Travel to A to Z, and having reached the point – take a holiday.

JOHN: It’s holiday time.

PAUL: Achieve something, everyday. [pause]

YOKO: It’s a hell of a lot to ask for…

JOHN: That’s sort of hard to live up to, Paul.

PAUL: [very quiet] It’s very hard to live up to.

MICHAEL: Ernest Hemingway had a very good remark about that, which I’ve unfortunately forgotten. About achieving something everyday. It’s the only thing of his writings I like.

PAUL: It may in theory sound silly, but—

JOHN: In practice…

PAUL: —it’s even sillier. Well, if practice is all there is.

JOHN: This is where it’s at.

PAUL: This is where it’s at, unless that is where it’s at.

JOHN: This is where it’s at, now.

PAUL: Mm-hmm. [long pause] Teamwork. A good defense. And a line of forwards. A good strong pair of boots.

YOKO: [inaudible]

JOHN: You play ball with me, and I’ll play ball with you.

PAUL: Don’t swing the lead, sonny.

JOHN: Every cloud have a silver mouth boat.

PAUL: Could be learning something instead of this, you know.

JOHN: Bob Newridges is a tartan that covers Yorkshire.

PAUL: Rutland is the smallest county.

JOHN: Scarborough is a college scarf.

PAUL: Amo amas a minge.

JOHN: [laughs] Amanty meaty monkey monk… [Paul laughs]

YOKO: [to Michael] Are we going to see the rushes, or—?

PAUL: This is the – this is the typical end-product of an actor’s career.

JOHN: Alexander the Great was a bighead. Or a fireplace. [long pause] Why do they call it Great Britain? How long is it going to go on? Fantastic France. Amazing America.

PAUL: Huge Spain.

JOHN: [laughs] Huge Spain. I’ll drink to that. [pause] When is a door not a door?

RINGO: I don’t know.

JOHN: When it’s ajar.

PAUL: When it’s ajar.

RINGO: Two flies on a door. Which one was sick?

JOHN: I don’t know.

RINGO: The one on the panel.

JOHN: I don’t blame it. [pause] Why did the chickie cross the road?

PAUL: You see what you’ve done to us, pal?

RINGO: To get to the other side.

JOHN: You’ve heard it before!

RINGO: Yes.

JOHN: Clichés…

RINGO: What goes over water, under water, and never gets wet?

JOHN: Hmm… a rubber mac.

RINGO: No, an egg in a duck’s belly.

PAUL: [cutting in] Now, alright, we can’t carry on like this indefinitely now, can we?

RINGO: I beg you?

PAUL: We can’t carry on like this indefinitely.

JOHN: Doing this?

RINGO: We seem to be.

PAUL: We seem to, but we can’t. Because our hearts are—

JOHN: Should we go play our group, then?

PAUL: There’s the other point.

JOHN: I think this is rather good.

PAUL: It’s alright, I must say, but we can’t carry on like this indefinitely.

JOHN: As some clips in between.

PAUL: Yeah.

JOHN: [pause] As I said, I’m just recovering from the day, you know…

PAUL: Dyspepsia.

YOKO: From the night, frankly.

JOHN: [stage whisper] Oh, don’t say that, you’re be revealings!

YOKO: [laughs] Oh… I didn’t think about that.

JOHN: “From the night”, indeed. Next thing you’ll be telling them about our black sheets! [laughter] Enriched with Marylebone Station… [fidgeting; gets up] Right. [to Paul] Guitars? I thought that’s what they do.

PAUL: That is what they do, but if you’re singing—

JOHN: Oh, I’ll even sing you half a song I was writing.

PAUL: [gets up; to Ringo] C’mon. Sounds. How’s – how’s about?

RINGO: [subdued] Sound city… Yes, go on, I’ll come.

PAUL: [concerned] How are you feeling?

RINGO: No, I just feel a bit off. Very—

PAUL: [joking; bleak] Last two years, actually.

RINGO: [laughs] No, it’s not that. It’s just that some days— [inaudible; drowned out by voice marking slate] —you don’t know how you feel.

(Note: Kevin Harrington is one of the production runners in the studio. The phrase “canyons of your mind” is in reference to the song by The Bonzo Dog Doo Dah Band. Doug Sulpy describes John and Paul’s exchange in part as “a duel of witticisms”.

During this period of time John was using heroin, which is the most probable cause - directly or indirectly - for his vomiting.)

### ‘In The Middle Of An Island’ / ‘Gilly, Gilly, Ossenfeffer, Katzenellen Bogen by the Sea’

January 21st, 1969 (Apple Studios, London): A singing of the 1957 song ‘In The Middle Of An Island’ segues naturally into ‘Gilly, Gilly, Ossenfeffer, Katzenellen Bogen by the Sea’.

### Too bad about sorrows, too bad about love

January 21st, 1969 (Apple Studios, London): Paul leads the band into a lively rendition of Ronnie Hawkins’ ‘Forty Days’ (itself a variant of Chuck Berry’s ‘Thirty Days’). John and Paul exchange some nascent wordplay on the Rolling Stone journalist Al Aronowitz and then break into an old Lennon-McCartney composition.

JOHN: Another Lennon-McCartney original entitled ‘All I Want Is You’.

PAUL: Al a one a two. Al Aronowitz. Al Aronowitz.

JOHN: Al Aronowitz if you’ll Aronowitz. We’ll both Aronowitz together.

PAUL: Too bad about sorrows / Too bad about love…

JOHN & PAUL: There’ll be no tomorrow…

PAUL: You said you were sleeping / But I can’t forget / The trouble you’re leaving…

### Shag! Everybody shag now!

January 21st, 1969 (Apple Studios, London): John and Paul sing brief racy takes of ‘You’re Gonna Lose That Girl’ and ‘Shout!’.

### ‘William Street Boogie’

January 21st, 1969 (Apple Studios, London): Paul gurgles ludicrously throughout a blues boogie with entirely improvised lyrics.

## 1/22

### For the sake of the boy you once knew

January 22nd, 1969 (Apple Studios, London): After John tells Yoko, Paul, and George about having received a letter from Millie Sutcliffe requesting his financial support, George reads aloud from the letter while John expresses his derision for Mrs. Sutcliffe’s justification of responsibility - his old friendship with Stuart - and points out that Stuart didn’t even have much regard for her.

GEORGE: Well, what’s Mrs. Sutcliffe want?

JOHN: Well, what they all want – money.

GEORGE: [reading] “This is the last cry for help. My bank is now to the wall—” [laughs] My “back”.

JOHN: “Back”, “bank”. [George laughs] I thought it was “bank” too.

GEORGE: “—as it’s been many times before, but this is the last time. Since [Stuart’s father] Charlie’s sudden death in March ’66, o my consequent o’ long—” What?

YOKO: [reading] “Illness”.

GEORGE: “—illness, I have managed to exist—”

JOHN: [withering] “Illness”? She’s an alcoholic.

GEORGE: “—but now it is the end of the road.”

JOHN: She’s an alcoholic, you know.

GEORGE: “I beg of you, please come if only for the sake of the boy you once knew.” Fucking hell…

JOHN: You know, what’s it got to do with me?

GEORGE: What’s it got to do with Stu?

JOHN: Yeah.

GEORGE: I mean, she didn’t know him.

JOHN: No, he hated her anyway. [laughter] I remember at college he used to tell me so. Except for she gave him twenty ciggies a day and five bob. [pause] So I mean, it’s registered [inaudible], I’ve just got to write her and say, “What?” Or something. I ought to… Should we carry on here, in the rock‘n’roll show?

GEORGE: [laughs] Yeah.

## 1/23

### Oh come on, Ringo, you really know how to swing

January 23rd, 1969 (Apple Studios, London): While waiting for Paul and George to arrive in the studio, Michael Lindsay-Hogg asks a piano-toying Ringo if he will have his own song for the upcoming Beatles album. (Note: The song Ringo will work on over the next few days is, of course, ‘Octopus’s Garden’.) 

MICHAEL: Are you going to sing [your own song on this record]? 

RINGO: Um, more than likely I’ll get one later on. 

MICHAEL: Good. 

JOHN: Didn’t George write you one too?

RINGO: George has written one for both of us. 

JOHN: You’re both in it?

RINGO: Yeah. [John and Yoko laugh] Hey hey Georgie— [starts playing piano]

JOHN: [laughs] Is it?

RINGO: —come on, play that thing! 

JOHN: [laughs] Is it?

RINGO: Yeah. [laughs] Oh come on, Ringo, you really know how to swing! One of those. 

### We could make it our last single

January 22nd, 1969 (Apple Studios, London): As the band works on ‘I’ve Got A Feeling’, an earlier conversation about Martin Luther King Jr. inspires Paul to improvise a line. John suggests they have a song about dreams as their last single. (Note: John could be thinking of Johnnie Taylor’s ‘I Had A Dream’ or Ray Charles’ ‘I Had A Dream’.)

PAUL: All that I’ve been looking for was somebody who looks like you / I had a dream this afternoon!

JOHN: I think somebody’s written it, actually.

PAUL: Oh.

JOHN: I have a feeling some spade wrote one called ‘I Had A Dream’.

PAUL: Oh, yeah. [pause] I have a dream…

JOHN: We could make it our last single.

### Very phallic

January 23rd, 1969 (Apple Studios, London): Gallery owner Robert Fraser drops in on the sessions to find the lights in the studio blown out after a circuit overload. Yoko asks Robert (who hosted John and Yoko’s You Are Here art show) whether he’s already seen John and Yoko’s short films, and Robert enquires about the anvil in the room (which is being used for ‘Maxwell’s Silver Hammer’) which John makes fun of, comparing it to a conceptual art piece. Paul, who has been playing the piano, chats with Robert about the song.

PAUL: We’re having a bit of trouble. [laughs]

ROBERT: Oh no.

JOHN: Not one emergency light in all of them!

ROBERT: You should have a candle. Or I’ll give you a candle. Is that piece of anvil from [inaudible]?

JOHN: Yes, it’s a Henry Moore we had brought in.

ROBERT: Yeah.

JOHN: Henry Moore’s anvil.

ROBERT: Very phallic. [pause]

PAUL: [laughs] It’s just a reminder. To remind you about ‘Maxwell’s Silver Hammer’ all the time. An anvil that will never be removed. Bang bang Maxwell’s silver hammer…

ROBERT: Was this, um, a blacksmith’s place, before? [Paul laughs] In the basement?

PAUL: This is Mal’s instrument. For a song called ‘Maxwell’s Silver Hammer’.

ROBERT: Oh I see, yeah.

PAUL: When Mal hits it. “Bang bang, Maxwell’s silver hammer.”

ROBERT: Why did you decide it had to be an anvil?

PAUL: It was just that – you see, it was just that sound that came to me one day. A silver hammer on an anvil.

ROBERT: Yeah. Very refined. Really terrific.

## 1/24

### We’re a couple of queens

January 24th, 1969: As John and Paul discuss their vocal arrangement for ‘Two Of Us’, John wryly points out the queerness in having them share lead vocals on a love song. Paul, undeterred, suggests the male-female singing duo Paul and Paula step in for them as a replacement.

PAUL: Okay, “two of us riding nowhere,” that’s as if – [that’s] said we’re like – two, but then “we’re on our way home—”

JOHN: It’s like we’re like a couple of queens.

PAUL: Yeah. Well, you know. Well, I mean, that’s—

JOHN: We’re a couple of queens…

PAUL: [American accent] That’s just too bad. Unless you want to get Paul and Paula in. [pause] Poetic license, John.

JOHN: [American accent] You’re telling me, Paul.

### It’s like you and me are lovers

January 24th, 1969: After John and Paul run through another take of ‘Two Of Us’, Paul comments on the narratives and discreet emotional correlation between their songs.

PAUL: It’s like, uh, “We have to get back.” “We’re on our way home.”

JOHN: Yeah.

PAUL: There’s a story. There’s another one – ‘Don’t Let Me Down’. “Oh darling, I’ll never let you down.” Like we’re doing—

JOHN: Yeah. It’s like you and me are lovers.

PAUL: [reserved] Yeah. [pause]

JOHN: We’ll just have to camp it up for those two.

PAUL: Yeah. Well, I’ll be wearing my skirt for the show, anyway.

### Balls to your partner, arses to the wall

January 24th, 1969 (Apple Studios, London): Paul briefly breaks into a curious ditty during a lull between takes. (Note: Mr. Bengelstein, I presume?) 

PAUL: Balls to your partner / Arses to the wall… 

### Boiled testicle

January 24th, 1969: John and Paul play through an old Lennon-McCartney song called ‘I Fancy Me Chances’, amuse themselves with their lunch orders, and ponder the etymological origins of “brer”. Paul then talks to himself about being a carpenter.

JOHN: Crepe corbett.

PAUL: Broccoli hors d'oeuvre.

JOHN: Sparrow on toast.

PAUL: … Boiled testicle.

### You pretend to be in with the in crowd

January 24th, 1969 (Apple Studio): During a break in the Let It Be sessions, Paul makes up a song about his (less famous) dog, Eddie. To John’s amusement and eventual participation, it turns into an extended ode to Beatles pets. (Note: Mentioned are Ringo’s dog Tiger, John’s dog Bernard, John’s late dog Nigel, and John’s cat Mimi. John’s poem Good Dog Nigel recounts his unfortunate demise - at the hands of Aunt Mimi.)

JOHN: [laughs] You have to sing it “There you go, Bernard”. ’Cause he was given away. 

JOHN & PAUL: [singing] There you go, Bernard, Bernard, Bernard… I’m so sad to see you go, Bernard, Bernard you dog. 

## 1/25

### After this is all over, you’ll be off in a black bag somewhere

January 25th, 1969 (Apple Studios, London): After a protracted discussion about the prospective production value of (what will eventually be) the Let It Be documentary, George tries to allay Paul’s underlying (overriding) concerns about the still-unstructured production and tells him that the group’s best efforts have tended to be spontaneous anyway, and John points out that Paul’s retainment of his original intentions for this project, in spite of its changes over the past three weeks, is what is causing him anxiety. Paul responds in a possible intimation of his own investment in the band in comparison to John’s, and John, in possible acknowledgment of it, contends that he would dig playing onstage as The Beatles again, if not for the inertia they would inevitably labour under as a touring group.

As Paul bleakly compares their present monotony in the studio precisely to the monotony they felt while on tour performing the same songs over and over again night after night, George reasons (not unkindly) that it’s an emotional cycle that everyone goes through, no matter the state of affairs they’re in, and in this case, feels the familiarity of Apple Studios (attendant film crew non-withstanding) would be better for the group’s musical finesse than having to involve themselves with the hassle of touring again. Paul, however, remains uncertain of his own feelings and wonders aloud about why he feels them at all. Producer Glyn Johns, who has been listening in, sincerely vouches for the buoyant studio atmosphere and heartening improvement the band has made in the past couple of days, and Yoko, likewise, encourages Paul to ride on the upswing and not tie himself down with the variables.

GEORGE: The things that’ve worked out best ever for us haven’t really been planned any more than this has. It’s just, you know, it’s like you just go into something and then it does it itself, you know. Whatever it’s gonna be, it becomes that, you know. 

JOHN: See, it’s turned out – that, for that, but it’s not what Paul wants. Like, you know, it was – it’s like if – say it’s his number, this whole show. Well it’s turned – it’s a compromise. So now it’s actually turned into our number more than his number. That’s all. 

PAUL: Yeah, and that’s— 

JOHN: And uh— 

PAUL: —and that’s alright, you know. It’s—  

JOHN: It’s alright, but I mean that’s what’s bugging you, really. Because it’s a different number, you know. It’s turned into a rock number as opposed to a choir number or something, you know, like that. And uh… [quiet] it’s just that, really. [silence] 

PAUL:

But it’s just funny to sort of realise that after this is all over, you’ll be off in a black bag somewhere – on the Albert Hall, you know.

JOHN: Yes. 

PAUL: And sort of doing shows and stuff, and you know, digging—

JOHN: Yeah, but I— 

PAUL: —digging that thing of it. 

JOHN: But I don’t – I would dig to play on stage, you know. 

PAUL: Yeah. 

JOHN: I mean, if it was – if everything was alright and there was no messing, and we were just going to play onstage… you know.

PAUL: Yeah. But it’s only that. It’s only that. I’d like to see Ringo and us – [inaudible] you know, and all that. But I mean—

JOHN: That’s why I said yes to the TV show. I didn’t want the – the hell of doing it. 

PAUL: —and I’d like that. I’d like that, see, so that’s—

JOHN: Well, I like playing – ‘cause that’s why I went on the Stones show [Rock and Roll Circus], you know?

PAUL: Mm. 

JOHN: [faltering] And that’s why I’ll – I’ll do – things, but I mean if – if we all don’t want to do that… 

PAUL: [reserved] Yeah, I know, it is that. It’s like the majority decision to – yeah. 

JOHN: [wary] But I don’t want to sort of, uh, go on the road again. [silence; guitar playing] 

PAUL: Yeah. I just feel as though we are on the road again. I mean, we are, but we’re in the studio. Like, and we just keep to the same environment, totally. Always. We don’t ever attempt to break out of that. 

JOHN: Well, we did, though! We did.  

PAUL: And that’s – you know. So I mean— 

GEORGE: Yeah. It’s just, you break out of one into another and then you want to break out of that. 

PAUL: Yeah, but I mean – you know. 

YOKO: Maybe next week— 

PAUL: [preoccupied] It is like the reason it’s nice to live on the country, you know. Just because it’s nice out there. It’s nice in a warm environment, you know. 

YOKO: [to Paul referring to the other Beatles?] Maybe next week they might change their minds, though. 

JOHN: [to Yoko] [inaudible]

GEORGE: In my opinion this is the nicest place I’ve been for a long time, this studio. 

PAUL: Yeah, it is. 

GEORGE: No, really, you know. I mean, and also we’ve played – this is the most I’ve ever played, by playing everyday. And I can just, you know, feel myself getting – me fingers getting loose, a bit. Because we don’t get a chance for that. But if we go out on the road, then – or whatever – it falls, it gets back into that one. But really I just want to play, and you can play better without having to, you know, do all those things. 

PAUL: [preoccupied] Yeah. 

GEORGE: I mean, it’s not so bad now – but it is, really, it would be easier to play without all these mics and without all the cameras and things like that. But uh… 

PAUL: Yeah, it’s alright. [silence; George starts playing Bob Dylan’s ‘All I Really Want To Do’]

…

PAUL: I don’t know what it is, you know, that I’m moaning about, but it’s just sort of—

GLYN: I must admit, I can’t really see it like – [laughs; optimistic] because it’s – it’s just seeing the last two days, everything’s gone so ridiculously well. 

PAUL: It is, it’s going great, really good. 

YOKO: It’s going great. 

GLYN: We still need—

YOKO: [to Paul; encouraging] And maybe next week it might change, you don’t know.

PAUL: Yeah, sure, I mean… 

YOKO: I mean, it might be great… and everyone might feel like going outside, you know.

PAUL: Mm. 

### ‘I Lost My Little Girl’

January 25th, 1969 (Apple Studios, London): Uninterested in discussing the technical vagaries of the Get Back/Let It Be production with Paul and Michael-Lindsay Hogg any longer, John starts to riff on Paul’s very first composition, ‘I Lost My Little Girl’. Everyone else in the group eventually joins in to jam. (Note: John actually starts singing the song about three minutes prior to the start of this clip, when Paul is still in discussion with Michael Lindsay-Hogg. So, he’s been going on for a while.)

### Eins zwei drei vier! You and I have memories

January 25th, 1969: John and Paul amuse themselves with ‘Two Of Us’, singing it in German accents, Scottish accents, Jamaican accents, and… whatever else besides.

### I’ll have you banned from bloody Apple

January 25th, 1969 (Apple Studios, London): As the band starts to meander after several imperfect and increasingly unserious rehearsals of ‘Let It Be’ (including a stray comment from Paul that prompts John and George to break into Chuck Berry’s 'I’m Talking About You’), Paul tries to steer them back to a serious run-through. John protests in jest and, perhaps reminded of the Beatles’ improvised Christmas records, starts thanking the fans for all of the gifts they’ve sent. The next rehearsal of 'Let It Be’ is foiled again by Paul and Ringo, however, enabling John to get into a mock-tirade about not even reaching the part of the song where he comes in (to the amusement of the group). 

PAUL: Come on now, come on now, come on now. Come on now – back to the drudgery. 

JOHN: [mock-outrage] It’s you that’s making it like this, it’s you that’s bloody making it like—

PAUL: The real meaning of Christmas. [starts playing ‘Let It Be’]

JOHN: I’d especially like to thank you for all the birthday presents…  

…

PAUL: There will be an answer, let it be… [falters; laughs] Then, is it— 

JOHN: Ah! 

PAUL: Ah.

JOHN: You shook me. [to Ringo] You stuck in another verse there, Richard. 

PAUL: Yeah. You send me.

RINGO: What?

JOHN: He’s got another verse in there, now. You come in with the flugle. 

RINGO: Alright, John!

PAUL: [laughs] You only have to pick your nose and a camera and a boom is over there… 

JOHN: Okay, this is your last chance. 

PAUL: Now look boys, now come on. Enthuse a little.

JOHN: [mock-outrage] I can’t, I don’t even get up to my bit, you keep finishing! [everyone laughs] Shut up, will ya, or I’ll have you banned from bloody Apple if you don’t shut up! [Paul laughs; John subdues himself] Okay, “Let it be…” is where I come in… [laughter]

## 1/26

### Did you dream about me last night?

January 26th, 1969: Paul arrives at the studio accompanied by Linda and Heather just as George and Ringo are working out the melody for ‘Octopus’s Garden’ on the piano. John, who has been playing around on drums, chimes in none too discreetly with a question he’s been eager to ask Paul.

JOHN: Hey! Did you dream about me last night?

PAUL: [long pause] I can’t remember.

JOHN: Very strong dream. We both dreamt about it. It was amazing! Different dreams, you know, but I thought you must’ve been there. [inaudible] I was touching you. [inaudible]

PAUL: Nothing to worry about, though?

JOHN: Nothing to worry about, no.

### Octopuses pick up all the seashells

January 26th, 1969 (Apple Studios, London): As the Beatles work on the arrangement for Octopus’s Garden’, Ringo tells Paul about the basis for the song, piquing George’s memory of what he was once told about octopuses. (Note: John’s on drums. This clip from the sessions is shortly followed by Heather sharing her personal octopus anecdote with John - which I can’t make out, unfortunately - and more animal banter.)

GEORGE: Hey, it was somebody – he was telling me octopuses go and pick up all the seashells. You know about that?

RINGO: Yes, that’s why I wrote it! ‘Cause the guides told me [about them] on the boat in Sardinia. [inaudible]

GEORGE: Yeah. [to Paul] You know about that? They collect all nice-looking things and make a garden around where they are and just with all their groovy things to sleep behind.

RINGO: Yeah.

GEORGE: [laughs] It’s great.

### You don’t eat any cats

January 26th, 1969 (Apple Studio): While Paul, George, and Ringo work on the arrangement for ‘Octopus’s Garden’, John teases Paul and Linda’s daughter Heather about her new pets.

HEATHER: We’ve got some baby kittens only about that big—

JOHN: Are you going to eat them?

HEATHER: No!

JOHN: Lots of people do, you know. I don’t, I mean.

HEATHER: Kittens that have just been born yesterday, or a few days—

PAUL: On toast? On toast?

JOHN: You put pastry around them, and then you have cat pie.

HEATHER: A few days they were just born, weren’t they?

JOHN: Oh, you’d better wait a week or two before you eat them.

HEATHER: No, I’m never going to eat them!

JOHN: Aren’t you? Well, that’s very good.

HEATHER: And then we took the grown-ups, and one of them’s beautiful, like this Daddy cat. It’s got a big black spot there—

JOHN: Oh, you don’t eat them if they have black spots.

HEATHER: The other one’s like a tiger.

JOHN: You don’t eat them if they’re like tigers, either. [laughter]

HEATHER: You don’t eat any cats! They don’t taste good. [general laughter] And anyway, I’m just a pussycat who was just born.

JOHN: Are you?

PAUL: Okay, pussycat.

JOHN: There’s a good dog. Puss. 

…

HEATHER: Stop keep – stop keep calling me “dog”, I’m a cat.

JOHN: Okay, cat.

### Cat food tins are too small

January 26th, 1969: While listening to a playback of ‘For You Blue’, Paul and Linda’s daughter Heather tells everyone about her pet kittens, and starts a discussion amongst John, Yoko, Paul, Linda, and George about their cat food preferences. 

HEATHER: Then the other kittens will have other kittens, then the other kittens - listen, Paul! - then you know, the other babies will have other babies and the other babies will have other babies, and the other babies will have other babies… and then some will have to be in our room, and in your room, and in everybody’s room! And then it’ll be too much. 

…

JOHN: And they always make cat food tins too small.

…

JOHN: [laughs] I give them ping pong balls. [Heather roars] 

### Is that food? Cooking?

January 26th, 1969 (Apple Studios, London): After a couple dozen takes of ‘Let It Be’, John and George betray their restlessness and hunger, while Paul suggests a couple more takes before they take a break. John and Paul converse in mock-German.

JOHN: Should we do it once more and have dinner? It must be our dinner cooking, nobody else lives here.

GEORGE: Is that food? Cooking?

## 1/27

### How much does he love Yoko?

January 27th, 1969 (Apple Studios, London): Over breakfast, John shows Paul a book he’s had compiled of the various press articles covering John and Yoko’s You Are Here art show. Paul reads aloud from some of the articles to the amusement of John and Yoko.

PAUL: “Beatle John Lennon hugged actress Yoko Ono last night and said, ‘My marriage is over. I am in love with Yoko. Of course my wife and I are not through legally—’” 

JOHN: That they put “actress” is great. 

YOKO: [laughs] No, they thought I performed in the Bottoms film. [laughter] They took it so seriously… 

JOHN: Said it seriously. 

PAUL: “How much does he love Yoko? ‘Much more than I love the Queen.’” [laughter; Paul hums] 

JOHN:

The layout of the book’s really good though, the way he’s done it. 

PAUL: This – is this the layout?

JOHN: No, this is just the bit – that bit, you know. Because he’s gonna have that folding out of the book, sheets, like, because – to get them all together. But it’s just, you know. The packaging is great. 

PAUL: It’s good, yeah. Great. [inaudible; continues reading articles aloud]

?: What else is there?

JOHN: There’s hundreds of things, you know, this is just the press part of it. There’s all the letters I got, and the photos of the exhibition, and – yeah. 

?: Oh, just this topic. 

JOHN: Yeah. The whole You Are Here book, you know. Book of the film of the video. 

?: And the policeman. Is that included in the film? The statement—

JOHN: No, no. This is just – just that one day. Reaction to one day. 

YOKO: It’s amazing, isn’t it? Just for that one day. 

PAUL: Yes. 

JOHN: But it’s just great you know, it’s sort of like what we’re doing now. We’re doing a show, and then you bring in a book of the show— 

PAUL: Yeah. 

?: Who’s doing it?

JOHN: Uh, publishing it?

?: Yeah. 

JOHN: Cape. That’s what I think—

YOKO: That’s what – I think that’s where we’re going with, Cape. 

JOHN: Yeah, I’m gonna go to Cape. 

PAUL: Is there a next book that you’ll be expecting?

JOHN: Yeah, but I owe it [inaudible] in the contract. 

PAUL: Oh, indeed. Great. 

JOHN: So they’ll have to pay for it, and it’s expensive. The other one’s cost nothing to do. 

?: Who does this for you?

YOKO: Oh, the [inaudible] or something. 

?: Oh, you have a [clipping] service, do you? Yeah, great. 

### You can’t book me for that, Constable

January 27th, 1969 (Apple Studios, London): As producer Glyn Johns grouses about having been apprehended by the police on a petty driving charge (and causing him to be late to arrive in the studio), Paul commiserates and humorously shares his own peeved exchanges with policemen on the road. 

PAUL: Let me take you down, ‘cause I’m going to…

GLYN: Can you believe that bleeding copper! [stuffy voice] “Oh, alright, I’ll have to report this, you know, anything you say will be taken down,” and it went through all that! 

JOHN: Have you got a fag?

GLYN: Yeah. 

PAUL: I had a terrible scene the other day on the motorway with a copper. ‘Cause they stopped me, and I – I don’t like it, getting stopped by police. I always get – I get obnoxious with them, you know. [Yoko laughs] ‘Cause I’ll just sort of check around to see if I’m in the right, and once I know I am, and they’ve stopped me, I get very… But they just stopped me because I was hogging the outside lane, and you’re not supposed to do that. So he said, “You did, you know.” You’re going seventy. You’ve got to stay out there, but you’re not supposed to get back in. So he stopped me, and then it really got sort of nasty after a bit. ‘Cause Linda just had her hand round the back of my head, and then he said, “You can’t possibly be in – in control!” 

YOKO: [laughs] Oh, no.  

PAUL: “You see how that young lady was fondling the back of your neck…” [uproarious laughter] And I said, “Oh, what’s up with you, then? Don’t you get it?” [laughter] You know, and it got really like that. “Oh! You can’t book me for that, Constable!” You know, it got really sort of… “Oh, can’t I!” [laughter] And of course, my tax. [laughs] They got me. My tax wasn’t up to date and all.

JOHN:

Don’t they just do it at the office for us?

PAUL: No. 

JOHN: Oh. I probably haven’t had one done since I started, then. [laughter] 

PAUL: They keep doing that. I was going through Mersey Tunnel, and they keep stopping me in the Mersey Tunnel ‘cause they see you and they just want an autograph. So I sort of thought, “Right, this time, they’re not going to stop me.” And a fella comes up, and I just – all the way through the tunnel, I did thirty. Just saw him in the mirror all the time. I thought, “You… you’re going to stop me at the end and ask me for an autograph.”

So he just sort of drives in front of me waves me down, so I’m just — ah! [laughter] – crash in with him and say, “No, no, I have no time, no time!” And he just… [grumbling] So he stopped me and said, “… Your tax.” [laughter] Yeah. I can’t stand that, I really go sort of funny with police. You know, police [inaudible] when nothing’s been done, fighting against them before they’ve got me for anything. I don’t like it.

### Happy and a rocker

January 27th, 1969 (Apple Studios, London): A chipper George is the last to arrive at the studio while the rest of the group is having breakfast. He tells the group that he was up the previous night writing a song (prompting John to reveal that he’s been having trouble sleeping himself), in mind of John’s old advice to finish a song within the time you start writing it. This, in full awareness of John’s own less-than-disciplined creative process, incites knowing laughter from the group. (Note: The song George wrote was ‘Old Brown Shoe’.)

JOHN: I have a complaint as a director of Apple – no bog paper.

PAUL: Oh yeah? [Yoko laughs]

JOHN: Terrible disgrace. 

PAUL: They’ve got [it in] pink upstairs.  

JOHN: Have they?

PAUL: Yeah. [George arrives]

JOHN: Hi. 

PAUL: Hi, George. 

GEORGE: Hello, how are you? Happy new year!

JOHN: [joking] George’s just come from a party too. 

GEORGE: [laughs] Yeah, I thought… 

JOHN: Two hours extra sleep [inaudible].

GEORGE: Oh, I didn’t, I went to bed very late. I wrote a new song, actually.

JOHN: I couldn’t sleep. 

GEORGE: I wrote a great song actually. 

JOHN: About what? [taps out a familiar rhythm in question] 

GEORGE: No, though – oh that, no, I just played with that bit. Just – a different one, altogether. Very exciting. [laughs] 

JOHN: It’s such a high when you get home. 

YOKO: Mm.

GEORGE: Happy. Happy, and a rocker…

PAUL: Yeah?

GEORGE: Happy and a rocker! [laughs] Too much. 

…

JOHN: Well, it’s just so high when you get in at night. 

GEORGE: Yeah, it’s great, isn’t it? [laughs]

JOHN: I just – you know, that bit like on acid, where you see a little hand miles away. 

PAUL: Mm.

JOHN: I was just sitting there listening to the last bit. [stage whisper] “Help! What if I have? What if I haven’t, today?” [laughter] You know, “[inaudible] Do they have anything?”

YOKO: You should just try in general. 

JOHN: I just can’t sleep! I just— [starts making garbled noises and sounds] You know. “I’m a feeling a little thing here…” [makes the sound of a trumpet blaring; laughs] 

GEORGE: Uh, I keep thinking, “Oh, I’ll just go to bed now,” and then I keep hearing your voice from about ten years ago saying, “Finish ‘em straightaway. As soon as you start ‘em, you’ve got finish it too.” [pause] You once told me it was best to finish a song, so I was just there to… [uproarious laughter]  

JOHN: [laughs] But I never do it, you know. I can’t do it. But I know it’s the best. 

PAUL: Yeah. 

### ‘Oh! Darling’

January 27th, 1969 (Apple Studios, London): The Beatles play an extended run-through of ‘Oh! Darling’, with John offering harmony and call-and-response to Paul’s lead vocal. (Note: A considerably shorter and edited version of this take was included on Anthology 3.)

PAUL: When you told me…

JOHN: When you told me…

PAUL: You didn’t need me…

JOHN: You’d never leave me…

PAUL: Anymore / You know I nearly broke down and died / Oh when you told me / You didn’t need me anymore / You know I nearly broke down and died…

### ‘Bring It On Home To Me’ / ‘Oh! Darling’

January 27th, 1969 (Apple Studios, London): John and Paul sing an ephemeral mashup of Sam Cooke’s ‘Bring It On Home To Me’ and ‘Oh! Darling’ before segueing into ‘Oh! Darling’ proper. 

### ‘Get Back’

January 27th, 1969: Paul sings an amusing mock-German version of ‘Get Back’ (along with liberal doses of mock-French).

### I cried for water, water, all I want is drink

January 27th, 1969: John and Paul play a bluesy mash-up during the Let It Be sessions, with John taking lead vocal for ‘Get Back’, and Paul singing an unidentified song (possibly made up on the spot) full of holy, apocalyptic fervor.

PAUL: Order! Order! We’ve got to call order, John, I mean, you know, we’re wasting valuable time here, son.

JOHN: Don’t let me down, babe!

## 1/28

### Attracts me like a pomegranate

January 28th, 1969: The Beatles work on how to play ‘Something’, while George figures out the lyrics for the song. 

GEORGE: Attracts me like a pomegranate… [laughs] We could have that, “attracts me like a pomegranate.”

…

JOHN: What were you saying?

GEORGE: I was saying, uh, “Did you know who missed the show?” And to a chorus of, “I don’t know, I don’t know.”

### Even badness must pass

January 28th, 1969: After John and Paul play a lethargic and depressed run-through of ‘All Things Must Pass’, George tries to convince them that the song can be optimistic, too.

GEORGE: But it’s happy too, because it’s like – it’s like, if all things pass… it is sad [if] it means it’s always gonna leave something there. Doesn’t it? It means even badness must pass. You know. It’s like… [long pause]

PAUL: Nothing’s permanent.

GEORGE: ‘Cause it said, uh, the last one says, “Darkness doesn’t last all night time, and in the morning, it will fade away.” [pause] “Sunlight—” What is it? “Daylight – is—”

PAUL: “The sunrise doesn’t last all morning.”

GEORGE: “Daylight is good at arriving at the right time.” ‘Cause it always does. It gets so dark, and suddenly – it just comes at the right time, and, you know. Like this was—

PAUL: It’s another shade of darkness, isn’t it? Or light.

### I wish that for just one time you could stand inside my shoes

January 28th, 1969: In a not-uncommon instance of subliminal messaging (ergo musical commentary) during the Let It Be sessions, George sings a strain from Bob Dylan’s ‘Positively 4th Street’. Paul, unwittingly or not, joins in.

GEORGE: And I know you’re dissatisfied with your position and your place; don’t you understand it’s not my problem? I wish that for just one time, you could stand inside my shoes, and just for that one moment, I could be you… I wish that for just one time, you could stand inside my shoes… You’d know what a drag it is to see you…

## 1/29

### We could be into other things

January 29th, 1969 (Apple Studios, London): A scattered morning discussion with Michael Lindsay-Hogg, Glyn Johns, and George Martin on the advent of having the group perform on the Apple Studios rooftop leads Paul into a circular conversation with John about the multiple media ventures they’re trying to pursue with this one recording session, and the persisting concern that the Beatles’ apparent lack of restriction (and lack of tolerance for having others impose restrictions upon them) is actually counterproductive to their efforts to complete the recording of the album. At a loss for articulating in concrete terms what may be obstructing the group from performing as well as they could, Paul wonders if they can only be cured of their repression and/or indecision if they are thrust unexpectedly into a foreign situation and forced by circumstance to adapt and improve unquestioningly, as they experienced in the early days of the band.

(Note: An edited segment of this discussion was later included in the official Let It Be documentary, as is depicted in this gif set here. Overall, the reality of John and Paul’s exchange is less one-sided than it may seem in the film; this excerpt in itself is but a portion of it, and it shortly after expands to include George as well when he arrives at the studio.)

JOHN: I can’t wait to work, here, you know.

PAUL: Yeah.

JOHN: Either… Anyway, you know. I just can’t wait to just—

PAUL: Do it.

JOHN: —have it, you know.

PAUL: Yeah, but so… Hmm. But I’m just talking about this thing, like this thing we’ve entered upon now, we still haven’t got any aim for it, except another album, again. Our only aim, ever, is an album. Which is like a very non-visual thing, it’s very sort of… But it’s great, isn’t it, and we do albums, then. But—

JOHN: But albums is what we’re doing, at the moment.

PAUL: [uneasy] Yeah, but I don’t know. Like—

JOHN: I mean, that’s what we [inaudible] talk about.

PAUL: —like I was saying the other day, is that you – is that you – you— [hesitating] We’re into albums as the four of us, but I really think we could be into other things. But every time I talk about it, I really sound like I’m the showbiz correspondent, trying to hustle us to do a Judy Garland comeback, you know. But really, all I mean is – well, look, let’s get – let’s change, or let’s go into a studio, like a vision studio, after we’ve learnt all of these, that’s just as good as this for sound, that’s got the same sort of thinking…

JOHN: I think it’s daft to move from this one, you know, I mean—

PAUL: But it’s like we got much better takes after we moved from Twickenham to here.

JOHN: Oh, yeah, but I mean here, in our life it’s like home, you know.

PAUL: Yeah, sure, but our takes are getting not as good. So I’m just trying to think of a remedy.

JOHN:Yes, but it’s up to Glyn to take it.

PAUL: Which he has been doing all yesterday, now, and ‘Get Back’, like you said, you know, we’re not in it.

JOHN: Yeah, but that depends on the day.

PAUL: But the thing that puts us in it are the things – the only ever thing that has put us in it is a novelty. We’re, you know—

JOHN: Yes, yes.

PAUL: We’re ve– we work on novelty. If there’s a new approach, if he says, “Take”, we take for the first time.

JOHN: Mm.

PAUL: Oh, you know, I mean, we’re gonna be great in the rough dubs, these, because we don’t care, you know, and it’s great. And now it’s gonna be very hard to better those – that dub we’ve got. There’s just so much in it, even ‘Teddy Boy’, not having words. It’s just, there’s so much in all of that.

JOHN: Yeah. Yeah, I have to agree—

PAUL: And it’s like, it’s gonna be hard to better it.

JOHN: —but I don’t think another move is gonna be the answer. It’s just like every—[inaudible]

PAUL: You see, I said to Michael that he should really just—just black this, just make this black one day, so that when we come in in the morning, it’s – “What is it?” I mean, you know. You’ve got to be sneaky with the Beatles, or else we’ll just go on forever in a circle. We really won’t get out of it. ‘Cause whenever we talk about it, we have certain rules – like George was saying. “What do you want to do?” And he says, “No films.” But it’s wrong, that. It’s very wrong, though, because you don’t know. He says – what he means is, “No Help! or Hard Day’s,” and I agree, you know. But like, films – ‘cause this is a film – and he now doesn’t mind this.

JOHN: Yeah.

PAUL: But it’s like – it’s that kind of thing, like no TV shows, no audience. But, I mean – see, it’s like when we came back from Hamburg and did Leicester Du Montfort Hall, or wherever it was, Coventry – we played the ballroom, and we had the worst first night then, and we were all nervous, and it was terrible. Then we played another the next night, and we got a little bit better; the next night, hmm; and then the next! [vocalising] It was just too much, and we got into the playing because we got over the hang-up of the audience, and it was just like there was no one there, but it was a ner– a new sort of thing, and there was some fella in the front watching how you were playing… you know? And you just – we were just right into it. And those would have been – if we could have recorded those things, they will have been the greatest, because it is. It’s like Mal was saying, he said, “It’s the bounce thing,” you know. And we’re good at that, you know, once we get over the nervousness. But it’s like, it’s the hurdle of that nervousness is there, now. So that… you know. [hesitating] We’re – we can’t get over it now, unless – well, unless we really sort of, like, go to the Albert Hall and get in a black bag, you know.

JOHN: Mm.

PAUL: There’s no other way. We can’t think ourselves out of it. And we can’t sort of say, well, it will be alright. See, and then the only other alternative to that is to say, well, we don’t – we will never do it to an audience again. But if we intend to – to keep any sort of contact on that scene… [pause] Yeah. I do understand George’s just saying, “There’s no point,” you know, because it is like we’re Stravinsky, and it’s in the music. And he doesn’t sort of get up and play his ‘Joanna’ for them anymore. He just writes it, and just sort of maybe occasionally conducts it.

JOHN: But as long as there’s a good reason – like George wants to do a heavy show, like Dylan and Presley, all that.

PAUL: Mm.

JOHN: And that’ll be a large – I don’t know, like, I mean, that – that’s all this.

PAUL: Mm, yeah, I know, yeah. that’s always – that’s always just—

JOHN: Okay, yeah.

PAUL: That’s us again, you know.

JOHN: Yes, I know.

PAUL: It’s us going silly again.

JOHN: It is, and I think – I think we might do it.

PAUL: Yeah, sure, but I mean the thing is they could do that one after you’ve done your own one, you know.

JOHN: Yes, yeah. But I think that—

PAUL: It’s like, it’s like this thing, man. There is a show to be had out of what we’ve got here, which is just so incredible. It’s unbelievable. And you don’t have to go on the roof, you don’t have to go anywhere. You really only have to sing ‘em. And combined with the documentary material leading up to it, it’s just like an unbelievable thing. Because you’ll have the two elements and you’ve got it there, and there’s no – we don’t need any need to move from here. But somehow we need to get us for the – see, it’s like we’ve got all the lead-up, and the only thing we haven’t got for every song is the – the song, yet.

### I enjoy it too, sometimes

January 29th, 1969: John and Paul work carefully on their vocal harmony for the refrain of ‘Dig A Pony’. John, whose voice is tired and strained, is self-deprecating about his own efforts. Paul, perhaps attuned to it, is quick to profess his admiration for the song.

JOHN & PAUL: All I want is you…

JOHN: But see, now we get into adding a little bit more paint, you know.

PAUL: It’s alright, yeah. No, that’s good, that one.

JOHN: Okay, tick it.

PAUL: [sincere] I love that one.

JOHN: [reticent] Thank you.

PAUL: [insistent] I really really do.

JOHN: Thank you. [quiet] I enjoy it too. Sometimes. [pause] So that’s done.

PAUL: Um—

JOHN: Next, please

### I’m just gonna do me for a bit

January 29th, 1969 (Apple Studios, London): With some reservation (and/or hesitation), George expresses his desire to record and release an album of solo material after the sessions for Get Back/Let It Be are concluded, in mind of all the songs he’s written and accumulated over the years. John and Yoko support the idea, but George (perhaps sensing that John’s perception of “going solo” and what it symbolises is more absolute than his own) elaborates that he thinks it’d be a good thing not just for each member of the band, but for the Beatles as a band proper - they would be able to both free themselves creatively in their own personal outlets as well as play and record as a group without feeling stifled, innately in tune with one another.

(In other words, the band doesn’t  have to sever all ties to go their own way. Ultimately, it’s difficult to determine if George is merely expressing, in a carefully unassuming way, his own intentions for individuation in light of John’s recent solo output with Yoko and growing estrangement from the Beatles family, or if he is making a discrete appeal to John of making up instead of breaking up, and is still, despite all of the Beatles’ overlapping troubles over the past two years, not least the past two weeks, genuinely attuned to the idea of the band staying together. Your mileage may vary.) 

GEORGE: John.

JOHN: Yeah?

GEORGE: I tell you what I’d like to do. After this—

PAUL: After this TV—?

GEORGE: —after this show. Um, you know, I’ve got so many songs that I’ve got, like, my quota of tunes for the next ten – you know, years, or albums.

JOHN: Yeah.

GEORGE: And I’d just like to maybe do an album, of songs.

JOHN: Of – on your own?

GEORGE: Yeah.

JOHN: Yeah.

GEORGE: But I mean, I’d like it so that if… uh… [long pause] ‘Cause it would be nice, it would be nice to mainly get them all out of the way—

JOHN: Yeah. It’d be nice anyway.

GEORGE: And secondly, just to hear what I – what all mine are like all together.

JOHN: Yeah, as long – you see, it’s good. If we put [out] an LP and it’s all safe that will be ‘cause it’s together, but George is doing an album and—

GEORGE: Oh yeah, but I mean it’d be nice to, uh—

JOHN: It’d be the same as me doing an album.

GEORGE: —if any of us can do the separate things, like, as well.

JOHN:

Well, I mean—

GEORGE: That way, it also preserves this, the Beatle bit of it, more. ‘Cause then—

JOHN: This – there’s an outlet for every note you want.

GEORGE: You know, ‘cause all these songs of mine, I can give them to people who could do them good, but I suddenly realised – fuck all that. I’m just gonna do me for a bit. [laughs] You know?

YOKO: That’s great. That’s a good idea.

JOHN: Yeah.

GEORGE: And uh, you know. [pause] With all these tunes I could do ‘em like – I could them in a week, at the most. I could have it all, just record ‘em all, remixed and everything, ‘cause they’re all very simple, you know. I mean, I don’t think they need much. I mean with a Leslie it’s too much, just one guitar. [starts playing ‘Let It Down’] Looking like I don’t care / but I do, I do… / Hiding it all behind anything I see / Should someone be looking at me… [laughs]

JOHN: “She won’t be looking at me”?

GEORGE: “Should someone be looking at me.”

JOHN: Oh.

GEORGE: While I occupy my mind / I can feel you here / Love to us is so well-timed / But I do, I do… / Wasting away these moments so heavenly / Should someone be looking at me…

### ‘Three Cool Cats’

January 29th, 1969 (Apple Studios, London): The Beatles perform a boozy rendition of The Coasters’ ‘Three Cool Cats’.

### ‘Two Of Us’

January 29th, 1969: John and Paul amuse themselves with ‘Two Of Us’, singing it with grit teeth.

## 1/31

### ‘Oh! Darling’

January 31st, 1969 (Apple Studios, London): John sings harmony with Paul in a lackadaisical take of ‘Oh! Darling’, until Paul picks up the tempo at the end.
