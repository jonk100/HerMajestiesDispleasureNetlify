### **November 9, 1966: The First Meeting**

* **Event:** John Lennon, encouraged by gallery owner John Dunbar, visits a preview of Yoko Ono's conceptual art exhibition, "Unfinished Paintings and Objects," at the Indica Gallery in London. He is intrigued by her piece "Ceiling Painting/Y E S Painting," which requires climbing a ladder to see the word "YES" through a magnifying glass. They are formally introduced.
* **Cynthia's Awareness:** **None.** Cynthia was not present. John later described the event to her, portraying Yoko as a "weirdo" artist and the event as a curiosity. At this stage, Cynthia perceives Yoko as just another eccentric figure in London's art scene, not a personal threat.

### **Late 1966 – Late 1967: The Intellectual Courtship**

* **Event:** Yoko begins a persistent campaign to contact John. She calls their home in Kenwood repeatedly and sends him a series of cryptic, conceptual "art" pieces and notes (e.g., a broken cup meticulously repaired, with a note about repairing it). John is both annoyed and fascinated. In October 1967, he secretly provides half the funding (£5,000) for her "Half-A-Wind Show" at the Lisson Gallery.
* **Cynthia's Awareness:** **Partial and Dismissive.** Cynthia was aware of the phone calls and the strange packages arriving at their home. According to her memoirs, she found them intrusive and annoying. She saw Yoko as a persistent and strange "groupie" or "hanger-on," but still did not view her as a romantic rival. She was completely unaware of John's financial backing of Yoko's art show.

### **February 1968: The Trip to India**

* **Event:** The Beatles and their partners, including John and Cynthia, travel to Rishikesh, India, to study Transcendental Meditation with the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi. During this time, John and Yoko maintain contact through correspondence. John receives daily letters from Yoko, which he eagerly awaits and reads in private. His obsession deepens.
* **Cynthia's Awareness:** **Growing Suspicion.** Cynthia was aware that John was receiving letters but did not know their full content or the intensity of the correspondence. She notes in "John" that he became more distant and secretive during this period. The trip, meant to bring clarity, instead created a deeper emotional chasm between them. The idea of Yoko as more than just an eccentric fan begins to form, but it's still a vague unease, not a certainty.

### **May 19, 1968: The Point of No Return**

* **Event:** With Cynthia away on a pre-planned holiday in Greece with friends, John invites Yoko to his home, Kenwood. Fueled by drugs and creative energy, they spend the night recording experimental sound collages that would become the *Two Virgins* album. They consummate their relationship at dawn.
* **Cynthia's Awareness:** **None.** She is in Greece, believing her marriage is strained but salvageable. This night is the definitive betrayal, happening entirely behind her back.

### **May 22, 1968: The Discovery**

* **Event:** Cynthia's holiday is cut short. She returns to Kenwood unexpectedly. She finds John and Yoko in the kitchen, sitting cross-legged on the floor, staring at each other. Yoko is wearing Cynthia's white bathrobe. John's only words to her are a casual, "Oh, hi."
* **Cynthia's Awareness:** **Absolute and Devastating.** This is the moment of irrefutable, traumatic discovery. There is no ambiguity. She sees with her own eyes that her marriage is over. In her memoirs, she describes fleeing the house in shock. This event is the emotional climax of her personal story and the undeniable starting point of John and Yoko's public life together.

## Narrative Significance

This timeline provides the "official story" of the breakup, the one that Cynthia and the world understood.

1. **The Slow Burn:** It shows that the affair wasn't a single impulsive act, but a gradual, year-and-a-half-long process. This gives Operation Minuet's psychological campaign ample time to work on John, with his growing paranoia and alienation being easily misinterpreted by Cynthia as symptoms of his obsession with Yoko.
2. **Cynthia's POV:** Her initial dismissal of Yoko makes her eventual discovery more tragic. She is not paranoid or jealous from the start; she is a wife trying to understand her husband's increasingly erratic behavior, making her a highly sympathetic and reliable narrator of events, even if she's an unreliable narrator of their cause.
3. **The Perfect Cover:** The emotional and domestic drama is so powerful and all-consuming that it provides the perfect cover for the underlying political conspiracy. The audience sees the symptoms of MI5's psychological warfare, but Cynthia can only see the affair. The facts of the timeline support her conclusion, which is what makes the conspiracy so effective.
