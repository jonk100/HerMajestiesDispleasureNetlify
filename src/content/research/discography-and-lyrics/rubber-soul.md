# Rubber Soul (1965)

## Recording Context
* **Location:** EMI Studios (Abbey Road), London.
* **The "Pot" Album:** George Harrison famously referred to *Rubber Soul* as the band's "pot album." The influence of marijuana led to a more relaxed, communal, yet highly creative atmosphere in the studio.
* **Spiritual/Individual State:**
    * **The Collective:** The band began to view an album as a cohesive piece of art rather than just a collection of singles and "filler" tracks.
    * **John Lennon:** Reaching a new peak of lyrical vulnerability. Influenced by Bob Dylan, he moved away from pop clichés toward deeply personal, sometimes surreal storytelling ("In My Life," "Norwegian Wood").
    * **Paul McCartney:** Showcasing increasing musical sophistication, influenced by the burgeoning folk-rock scene and the Beach Boys' *Pet Sounds*.
    * **George Harrison:** A landmark moment as he introduces the sitar to Western pop music on "Norwegian Wood," a significant step in his lifelong spiritual and musical journey.

## 1. Drive My Car
*Writer(s): Lennon/McCartney*

Asked a girl what she wanted to be,
She said, baby can't you see?
I wanna be famous, a star of the screen,
But you can do something in between.

Baby, you can drive my car, yes I'm gonna be a star,
Baby, you can drive my car, and maybe I'll love you.

I told that girl that my prospects were good,
She said, baby it's understood,
Working for peanuts is all very fine,
But I can show you a better time.

Baby, you can drive my car, yes I'm gonna be a star,
Baby, you can drive my car, and maybe I'll love you.
Beep beep mm, beep beep yeah!

Baby, you can drive my car, yes I'm gonna be a star,
Baby, you can drive my car, and maybe I'll love you.

I told that girl I could start right away,
And she said, listen, babe, I've got something to say,
I got no car, and it's breaking my heart,
But I've found a driver, that's a start.

Baby, you can drive my car, yes I'm gonna be a star,
Baby, you can drive my car, and maybe I'll love you.
Beep beep mm, beep beep yeah!

## 2. Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown)
*Writer(s): Lennon/McCartney*

I once had a girl,
Or should I say
She once had me.
She showed me her room,
Isn't it good?
Norwegian wood.

She asked me to stay and she told me sit anywhere,
So I looked around and I noticed there wasn't a chair.
I sat on a rug
Biding my time,
Drinking her wine.

We talked until two,
And then she said,
'It's time for bed'.
She told me she worked in the morning and started to laugh,
I told her I didn't, and crawled off to sleep in the bath.

And when I awoke
I was alone,
This bird has flown,
So I lit a fire,
Isn't it good?
Norwegian wood.

## 3. You Won’t See Me
*Writer(s): Lennon/McCartney*

When I call you up your line's engaged.
I have had enough, so act your age,
We have lost the time that was so hard to find,
And I will lose my mind,
If you won't see me, you won't see me.

I don't know why you should want to hide,
But I can't get through my hands are tied,
I won't want to stay I don't have much to say,
But I can turn away.
And you won't see me, you won't see me.

Time after time you refuse to even listen,
I wouldn't mind if I knew what I was missing.

Though the days are few they're filled with tears,
And since I lost you it feels like years,
Yes it seems so long, girl since you've been gone,
And I just can't go on,
If you won't see me, you won't see me.

## 4. Nowhere Man
*Writer(s): Lennon/McCartney*

He's a real Nowhere Man,
Sitting in his Nowhere Land,
Making all his Nowhere plans for nobody.

Doesn't have a point of view,
Knows not where he's going to,
Isn't he a bit like you and me?

Nowhere man please listen,
You don't know what you're missing,
Nowhere Man, the world is at your command.

He's as blind as he can be,
Just sees what he wants to see,
Nowhere Man can you see me at all?

Nowhere Man don't worry,
Take your time, don't hurry,
Leave it all till somebody else,
Lends you a hand.

Doesn't have a point of view,
Knows not where he's going to,
Isn't he a bit like you and me?

Nowhere Man please listen,
You don't know what you're missing,
Nowhere Man, the world is at your command.

He's a real Nowhere Man,
Sitting in his Nowhere Land,
Making all his Nowhere plans for nobody.
Making all his Nowhere plans for nobody.
Making all his Nowhere plans for nobody.

## 5. Think For Yourself
*Writer(s): Harrison*

I've got a word or two
To say about the things that you do,
You're telling all those lies,
About the good things we can have
If we close our eyes.

Do what you want to do,
And go where you're going to,
Think for yourself,
Cause I won't be there with you,

I left you far behind
The ruins of the life that you had in mind.
And though you still can't see,
I know your mind's made up,
You're gonna cause more misery.

Do what you want to do,
And go where you're going to,
Think for yourself,
Cause I won't be there with you.

Although your mind's opaque,
Try thinking more,
If just for your own sake.
The future still looks good,
And you've got time to rectify
All the things that you should.

Do what you want to do,
And go where you're going to,
Think for yourself,
Cause I won't be there with you.

## 6. The Word
*Writer(s): Lennon/McCartney*

Say the word and you'll be free,
Say the word and be like me,
Say the word I'm thinking of,
Have you heard the word is love.

It's so fine, it's sunshine,
It's the word love.
In the beginning I misunderstood,
But now I've got it, the word is good.

Spread the word and you'll be free,
Spread the word and be like me,
Spread the word I'm thinking of,
Have you heard the word is love.

It's so fine, it's sunshine,
It's the word love.
Everywhere I go I hear it said,
In the good and the bad books that I have read.

Say the word and you'll be free,
Say the word and be like me,
Say the word I'm thinking of,
Have you heard the word is love.

It's so fine, it's sunshine,
It's the word love.
Now that I know what I feel must be right,
I mean to show everybody the light,
Give the word a chance to say,
That the word is just the way,
It's the word I'm thinking of,
And the only word is love,
It's so fine, it's sunshine,
It's the word love.

## 7. Michelle
*Writer(s): Lennon/McCartney*

Michelle ma belle
These are words that go together well,
My Michelle,

Michelle ma belle,
Sont les mots qui vont très bien ensemble
Tres bien ensemble.

I love you, I love you, I love you,
That's all I want to say,
Until I find a way,
I will say the only words I know that you'll understand.

Michelle ma belle,
Sont les mots qui vont très bien ensemble
Tres bien ensemble.

I need to, I need to, I need to,
I need to make you see,
Oh what you mean to me,
Until I do I'm hoping you will know what I mean.

I love you.
I want you, I want you, I want you,
I think you know by now,
I'll get to you somehow,
Until I do I'm telling you so you'll understand.

Michelle ma belle,
Sont les mots qui vont très bien ensemble
Tres bien ensemble.
I will say the only words I know that you'll understand,
My Michelle.

## 8. What Goes On
*Writer(s): Lennon/McCartney/Starr*

What goes on in your heart,
What goes on in your mind?
You are tearing me apart,
When you treat me so unkind,
What goes on in your mind?

The other day I saw you,
As I walked along the road,
But when I saw him with you
I could feel my future fold.

It's so easy for a girl like you to lie,
Tell my why?
What goes on in your heart,
What goes on in your mind?
You are tearing me apart,
When you treat me so unkind,
What goes on in your mind?

I met you in the morning,
Waiting for the tides of time,
But now the tide is turning,
I can see that I was blind.

It's so easy for a girl like you to lie,
Tell me why?
What goes on in your heart.

I used to think of no one else,
But you were just the same,
You didn't even think of me
As someone with a name,
Did you mean to break my heart and watch me die,
Tell me why?

## 9. Girl
*Writer(s): Lennon/McCartney*

Is there anybody going to listen to my story,
All about the girl who came to stay?
She's the kind of girl you want so much it makes you sorry,
Still you don't regret a single day.
Ah girl, girl.

When I think of all the times I tried so hard to leave her,
She will turn to me and start to cry,
And she promises the earth to me and I believe her,
After all this time, I don't know why.
Ah girl, girl, girl.

She's the kind of girl who puts you down
When friends are there, you feel a fool,
When you say she's looking good,
She acts as if it's understood,
She's cool 
Ah girl, girl.

Was she told when she was young the pain would lead to pleasure?
Did she understand it when they said
That a man must break his back to earn his day of leisure,
Will she still believe it when he's dead?
Ah girl, girl, girl.

## 10. I’m Looking Through You
*Writer(s): Lennon/McCartney*

I'm looking through you, where did you go?
I thought I knew you, what did I know?
You don't look different, but you have changed,
I'm looking through you, you're not the same.

Your lips are moving, I cannot hear,
Your voice is soothing but the words aren't clear.
You don't sound different, I've learned the game,
I'm looking through you, you're not the same.

Why, tell me why did you not treat me right?
Love has a nasty habit of disappearing overnight,
You're thinking of me the same old way,
You were above me, but not today.

The only difference is you're down there.
I'm looking through you and you're nowhere.
Why tell me why did you not treat me right?
Love has a nasty habit of disappearing overnight,

I'm looking through you, where did you go?
I thought I knew you, what did I know?
You don't look different, but you have changed,
I'm looking through you, you're not the same.
Yeah, baby you've changed.

## 11. In My Life
*Writer(s): Lennon/McCartney*

There are places I remember
All my life, though some have changed,
Some forever, not for better,
Some have gone and some remain.

All these places had their moments,
With lovers and friends I still can recall,
Some are dead and some are living,
In my life I've loved them all.

But of all these friends and lovers,
There is no one compares with you,
And these memories lose their meaning
When I think of love as something new.

Though I know I'll never lose affection
For people and things that went before,
I know I'll often stop and think about them
In my life I love you more.

---

## 12. Wait
*Writer(s): Lennon/McCartney*

It's been a long time, now I'm coming back home,
I've been away now, oh how I've been alone,
Wait till I come back to your side,
We'll forget the tears we cried.

But if your heart breaks, don't wait, turn me away,
And if your heart's strong, hold on, I won't delay,
Wait till I come back to your side,
We'll forget the tears we cried.

I feel as though you ought to know
That I've been good, as good as I can be,
And if you do, I'll trust in you,
And know that you will wait for me.

It's been a long time, now I'm coming back home,
I've been away now, oh how I've been alone,
Wait till I come back to your side,
We'll forget the tears we cried.

## 13. If I Needed Someone
*Writer(s): Harrison*

If I needed someone to love you're the one that I'd be thinking of
If I needed someone

If I had some more time to spend
Then I guess I'd be with you my friend if I needed someone

Had you come some other day then it might not have been like this
But you see now I'm too much in love

Carve your number on my wall and maybe you will get a call from me
If I needed someone

If I had some more time to spend
Then I guess I'd be with you my friend if I needed someone

Had you come some other day then it might not have been like this
But you see now I'm too much in love
Carve your number on my wall and maybe you will get a call from me
If I needed someone.

## 14. Run For Your Life
*Writer(s): Lennon/McCartney*

Well, I'd rather see you dead, little girl,
Than to be with another man.
You'd better keep your head, little girl,
Or you won't know where I am.

You'd better run for your life if you can, little girl,
Hide your head in the sand, little girl.
Catch you with another man,
That's the end - little girl.

Well you know that I'm a wicked guy
And I was born with a jealous mind,
And I can't spend my whole life trying
Just to make you toe the line.

You'd better run for your life if you can, little girl,
Hide your head in the sand, little girl.
Catch you with another man,
That's the end - little girl.

Let this be a sermon,
I mean everything I said,
Baby, I'm determined,
And I'd rather see you dead.

You'd better run for your life if you can, little girl,
Hide your head in the sand, little girl.
Catch you with another man,
That's the end - little girl.
