# Please Please Me (1963)

## Recording Context
* **Location:** EMI Studios (Abbey Road), Studio 2, London.
* **The "Marathon" Session:** Almost the entire album was recorded in one day—February 11, 1963. The band was fueled by tea, milk, and Zubes throat lozenges.
* **Spiritual/Individual State:** * **The "Gang" Mentality:** They are unified and fiercely protective of one another.
    * **John Lennon:** The dominant personality; pushing through a fever and a shredded throat to finish the session.
    * **Paul McCartney:** The diplomat and melodic architect, already showing a keen ear for arrangement.
    * **George Harrison:** Developing his "Gretsch sound"; his solos are concise and carefully practiced.
    * **Ringo Starr:** The newcomer (having joined only months prior), providing the rock-solid backbeat that defined their live energy.

## 1. I Saw Her Standing There
*Writer(s): McCartney/Lennon*

(One, two, three, four!)

Well, she was just seventeen
You know what I mean
And the way she looked
Was way beyond compare

So how could I dance with another (Ooh!)
When I saw her standing there?

Well, she looked at me
And I, I could see
That before too long
I'd fall in love with her

She wouldn't dance with another (Whooh!)
When I saw her standing there

Well, my heart went "boom"
When I crossed that room
And I held her hand in mine

Oh, we danced through the night
And we held each other tight
And before too long
I fell in love with her

Now I'll never dance with another (Whooh!)
Since I saw her standing there

(Guitar Solo)

Well, my heart went "boom"
When I crossed that room
And I held her hand in mine

Oh, we danced through the night
And we held each other tight
And before too long
I fell in love with her

Now I'll never dance with another (Whooh!)
Since I saw her standing there
Oh, since I saw her standing there
Well, since I saw her standing there

## 2. Misery
*Writer(s): Lennon/McCartney*

The world is treating me bad, misery
I'm the kind of guy who's always been alone
I'm so unlucky I'm the kind that's always on my own

I've lost her now for sure, I won't see her no more
It's gonna be a lonely world, misery

I'll remember all the little things we've done
Can't she see she'll always be the only one, only one

Send her back to me, 'cause everyone can see
Without her I will be in misery

I'll remember all the little things we've done
Can't she see she'll always be the only one, only one

Send her back to me, 'cause everyone can see
Without her I will be in misery
(Misery, misery)
Oh, misery
(Misery, misery)

## 3. Anna (Go to Him)
*Writer(s): Arthur Alexander*

Anna, you come and ask me, girl
To set you free, girl
You say he loves you more than me
Well, so I set you free
Go with him (Anna)
Go with him (Anna)

Anna, girl, before you go now
I want you to know now
That I still love you so
But if he loves you more, go with him

All of my life I've been searching for a girl
To love me like I love you
But every girl I've ever had
Breaks my heart and leaves me sad
What am I, what am I supposed to do?
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

Anna, girl, before you go now
I want you to know now
That I still love you so
But if he loves you more, go with him
(Anna) Go with him (Anna)
You can go now, girl (Anna)
Go with him

## 4. Chains
*Writer(s): Goffin/King*

Chains, my baby's got me locked up in chains
And they ain't the kind that you can see
Whoa, these chains of love got a hold on me, yeah

Chains, well I can't break away from these chains
Can't run around, 'cause I'm not free
Whoa, these chains of love got a hold on me, yeah

Now I believe my lips and yours could be so close together
If only I could break these chains and be free here forever

But chains, my baby's got me locked up in chains
And they ain't the kind that you can see
Whoa, these chains of love got a hold on me, yeah

(Guitar Solo)

Chains, chains of love
(Chains) Chains of love
(Chains) Chains of love

## 6. Ask Me Why
*Writer(s): Lennon/McCartney*

I love you, 'cause you tell me things I want to know
And it's true that it really only goes to show
That I know that I, I, I, I should never, never, never be blue

Now you're mine, my happiness still makes me cry
And in time you'll understand the reason why
If I cry, it's not because I'm sad
But you're the only love that I've ever had

I can't believe it's happened to me
I can't conceive of any more misery
Ask me why, I'll say I love you
And I'm always thinking of you

I love you, 'cause you tell me things I want to know
And it's true that it really only goes to show
That I know that I, I, I, I should never, never, never be blue

Ask me why, I'll say I love you
And I'm always thinking of you

I can't believe it's happened to me
I can't conceive of any more misery
Ask me why, I'll say I love you
And I'm always thinking of you
You, oh, you...

You'll never know how much I really love you
You'll never know how much I really care

Nobody knows, just we two

Say the words you long to hear
I'm in love with you, ooh
Ooh, ooh...

## 12. A Taste of Honey
*Writer(s): Scott/Marlow*

A taste of honey
Tasting much sweeter than wine
Doo-n-doo-doo
Doo-n-doo-doo

I dream of your first kiss and then
I feel upon my lips again
A taste of honey
Tasting much sweeter than wine

I will return, yes I will return
I'll come back for the honey and you

I dream of your first kiss and then
I feel upon my lips again
A taste of honey
Tasting much sweeter than wine

## 13. There's a Place
*Writer(s): Lennon/McCartney*

There is a place where I can go
When I feel low, when I feel blue
And it's my mind, and there's no time
When I'm alone

I think of you, and things you do
Go round my head, the things you've said
Like "I love only you"

In my mind there's no sorrow
Don't you know that it's so?
There'll be no sad tomorrow
Don't you know that it's so?

There is a place where I can go
When I feel low, when I feel blue
And it's my mind, and there's no time
When I'm alone

There's a place (There's a place)
There's a place (There's a place)
There's a place...
