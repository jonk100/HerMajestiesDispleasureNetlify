# Yellow Submarine (1969)

## Recording Context
* **Location:** EMI Studios (Abbey Road) and De Lane Lea Studios, London.
* **The Project:** A contractual obligation to provide new music for the United Artists animated film. The band was initially uninterested in the project, but they were so impressed by the film's innovative animation that they eventually contributed more material.
* **Spiritual/Individual State:**
    * **The Collective:** The album serves as a bridge between the peak psychedelia of 1967 and the more rock-oriented 1968. It is unique for featuring two significant George Harrison compositions on a single-disc release.
    * **John Lennon:** Provided the "nursery-rhyme" style rock of "Hey Bulldog," showcasing a rare moment of lighthearted band collaboration during the tense early '68 period.
    * **George Harrison:** Exploring cynicism toward the music industry ("Only A Northern Song") and profound philosophical transcendence ("It's All Too Much").
    * **George Martin:** Side Two of the original LP featured his orchestral score for the film, emphasizing his vital role in the "Beatles sound."

## 1. Yellow Submarine
*Writer(s): Lennon/McCartney*

In the town where I was born
Lived a man who sailed to sea
And he told us of his life
In the land of submarines

So we sailed up to the sun
Till we found the sea of green
And we lived beneath the waves
In our yellow submarine

We all live in our yellow submarine,
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
We all live in our yellow submarine,
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine

And our friends are all on board
Many more of them live next door
And the band begins to play

We all live in our yellow submarine,
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
We all live in our yellow submarine,
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine

As we live a life of ease
Everyone of us has all we need
Sky of blue and sea of green
In our yellow submarine.

We all live in our yellow submarine,
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
We all live in our yellow submarine,
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine

We all live in our yellow submarine,
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
We all live in our yellow submarine,
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine

## 2. Only A Northern Song
*Writer(s): Harrison*

If you're listening to this song
You may think the chords are going wrong
But they're not;
He just wrote it like that.
It doesn't really matter what chords I play
What words I say or time of day it is
As it's only a Northern song
It doesn't really matter what clothes I wear
Or how I fare or if my hair is brown
When it's only a Northern song.

When you're listening late at night
You may think the band are not quite right
But they are, they just play it like that
It doesn't really matter what chords I play
What words I say or time of day it is
As it's only a Northern song.

It doesn't really matter what clothes I wear
Or how I fare or if my hair is brown
When it's only a Northern song.

If you think the harmony
Is a little dark and out of key
You're correct, there's nobody there.

It doesn't really matter what chords I play
What words I say or time of day it is
And I told you there's no one there.

*Writer(s): Lennon/McCartney*

One, two, three, four

## 4. Hey Bulldog
*Writer(s): Lennon/McCartney*

Sheepdog
Standing in the rain,
Bullfrog
Doing it again
Some kind of happiness is measured out in miles
What makes you think you're something special when you smile?

Child-like
No one understands,
Jack knife
In your sweaty hands,
Some kind of innocence is measured out in years
You don't know what it's like to listen to your fears.
You can talk to me
You can talk to me
You can talk to me
If you're lonely you can talk to me

Big man
Walking in the park
Whigwam
Frightened of the dark
Some kind of solitude is measured out in you
You think you know me but you haven't got a clue
You can talk to me 
You can talk to me 
If you're lonely you can talk to me
[Hey] 
Hey Bulldog
Hey Bulldog 
Hey Bulldog 
Hey Bulldog 
Hey Bulldog

## 5. It's All Too Much
*Writer(s): Harrison*

It's all too much, It's all too much

When I look into your eyes, your love is there for me
And the more I go inside, the more there is to see

It's all too much for me to take
The love that's shining all around you
Everywhere, it's what you make
For us to take, it's all too much

Floating down the stream of time, of life to life with me
Makes no difference where you are or where you'd like to be

It's all too much for me to take
The love that's shining all around here
All the world's a birthday cake,
So take a piece but not too much

Set me on a silver sun, for I know that I'm free
Show me that I'm everywhere, and get me home for tea

It's all to much for me to see
A love that's shining all around here
The more I am, the less I know
And what I do is all too much

It's all too much for me to take
The love that's shining all around you
Everywhere, it's what you make
For us to take, it's all too much

It's too much.....It's too much

Too much too much too much

## 6. All You Need Is Love
*Writer(s): Lennon/McCartney*

Love, Love, Love.
Love, Love, Love.
Love, Love, Love.

There's nothing you can do that can't be done.
Nothing you can sing that can't be sung.
Nothing you can say but you can learn how to play the game.
It's easy.

Nothing you can make that can't be made.
No one you can save that can't be saved.
Nothing you can do but you can learn how to be you in time.
It's easy.

All you need is love.
All you need is love.
All you need is love, love.
Love is all you need.

All you need is love.
All you need is love.
All you need is love, love.
Love is all you need.

Nothing you can know that isn't known.
Nothing you can see that isn't shown.
Nowhere you can be that isn't where you're meant to be.
It's easy.

All you need is love.
All you need is love.
All you need is love, love.
Love is all you need.

All you need is love (Paul: All together, now!)
All you need is love. (Everybody!)
All you need is love, love.
Love is all you need (love is all you need).

Yee-hai!
Oh yeah!
She loves you, yeah yeah yeah.
She loves you, yeah yeah yeah.
