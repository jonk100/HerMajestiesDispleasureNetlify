# Magical Mystery Tour (1967)

## Recording Context
* **Location:** EMI Studios (Abbey Road) and Olympic Sound Studios, London.
* **The Project:** Conceived by Paul McCartney shortly after the death of manager Brian Epstein. The film was unscripted and experimental, mirrored by the kaleidoscopic nature of the music.
* **Spiritual/Individual State:**
    * **The Collective:** Dealing with the loss of Epstein's guidance, the band leaned further into their role as studio pioneers. While released as a double EP in the UK, the US LP version (included here) collected their 1967 singles to create a definitive psychedelic document.
    * **John Lennon:** Exploring the limits of language and sound on "I Am the Walrus" and delivering the era-defining anthem "All You Need Is Love."
    * **Paul McCartney:** Crafting cinematic pop like "The Fool on the Hill" and the nostalgic, multi-layered "Penny Lane."
    * **George Harrison:** Contributing the atmospheric "Blue Jay Way," showcasing his interest in the Hammond organ and Indian-influenced drones.

## 2. The Fool on the Hill
*Writer(s): Lennon/McCartney*

Day after day, alone on a hill,
The man with the foolish grin is keeping perfectly still
But nobody wants to know him,
They can see he's just a fool
And he never gives an answer.
But the fool on the hill sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head see the world spinning round.
Well on the way, head in a cloud,
The man of a thousand voices talking perfectly loud.
But nobody ever hears him
Or the sound he appears to make
But he never seems to notice.
But the fool on the hill sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head see the world spinning round.
And nobody seems to like him,
They can tell what he wants to do
And he never shows his feelings.
But the fool on the hill sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head see the world spinning round.

(round and round and round and round)
He never listens to them,
He knows that they're the fools
They don't like him. The fool on the hill sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head see the world spinning round.

## 4. Blue Jay Way
*Writer(s): Harrison*

There's a fog upon L.A.
And my friends have lost their way
We'll be over soon they said
Now they've lost themselves instead.

Please don't be long, please don't you be very long
Please don't be long or I may be asleep

Well it only goes to show
And I told them where to go
Ask a policeman on the street
There's so many there to meet

Please don't be long please don't you be very long
Please don't be long or I may be asleep

Now it's past my bed I know
And I'd really like to go
Soon it will be the break of day
Sitting here in Blue Jay Way

Please don't be long, please don't you be very long
Please don't be long or I may be asleep
Please don't be long, please don't you be very long
Please don't be long, please don't be long please don't you be very long
Please don't be long, please don't be long , please don't you be very long
Please don't be long

Don't be long - don't be long - don't be long
Don't be long - don't be long - don't be long

## 5. Your Mother Should Know
*Writer(s): Lennon/McCartney*

Let's all get up and dance to a song that was a hit
Before your Mother was born
Though she was born a long long time ago
Your Mother should know - your Mother should know
Sing it again.

Lift up your hearts and sing me a song that was a hit
Before your Mother was born
Though she was born a long long time ago
Your Mother should know - your Mother should know
Your Mother should know - your Mother should know
Sing it again.

Though she was born a long long time ago
Your Mother should know - your Mother should know
Your Mother should know - your Mother should know
Your Mother should know - your Mother should know

## 6. I Am the Walrus
*Writer(s): Lennon/McCartney*

I am he
As you are he
As you are me
And we are all together.

See how they run
Like pigs from a gun
See how they fly. I'm crying.
Sitting on a cornflake - waiting for the van to come.

Corporation teeshirt, stupid bloody
Tuesday man you been a naughty boy
You let your face grow long.

I am the eggman, they are the eggman -
I am the walrus .

Mr. City policeman sitting pretty little policeman in a row,
See how they fly
Like Lucy in the sky
See how they run. I'm crying - I'm crying, I'm crying.

Yellow matter custard dripping from a dead dog's eye.
Crabalocker fishwife, pornographic
Priestess, boy you been a naughty girl,
You let your knickers down.

I am the eggman they are the eggmen -
I am the walrus

Sitting in an English garden waiting for the sun,
If the sun don't come, you get a tan from
Standing in the English rain.

I am the eggman, they are the eggmen -
I am the walrus .

Expert texpert choking smokers
Don't you think the joker laughs at you?
See how they smile,
Like pigs in a sty,
See how they snied. I'm crying.

Semoline pilchards climbing up the Eiffel Tower.
Elementary penguin singing Hare Krishna
Man you should have seen them kicking Edgar Allen Poe.

I am the eggman, they are they eggmen -
I am the walrus

## 7. Hello, Goodbye
*Writer(s): Lennon/McCartney*

You say yes , I say no
You say stop and I say go, go, go.
Oh no.

You say goodbye and I say hello, hello, hello.
I don't know why you say goodbye, I say hello, hello, hello.
I don't why you say goodbye, I say hello.

I say high, you say low
You say why, and I say I don't know.
Oh no.

You say goodbye and I say hello, hello, hello.
I don't know why you say goodbye, I say hello, hello, hello.
I don't know why you say goodbye, I say hello.

Why, why, why, why, why, why,
Do you say goodbye, goodbye.
Oh no.

You say goodbye and I say hello, hello, hello.
I don't know why you say goodbye, I say hello, hello, hello.
I don't know why you say goodbye, I say hello.

You say yes, I say no

You say stop and I say go, go, go.
.Oh no.

You say goodbye and I say hello, hello, hello.
I don't know why you say goodbye, I say hello, hello, hello.
I don't know why you say goodbye, I say hello, hello, hello.
I don't know why you say goodbye, I say hello, hello, hello.

## 8. Strawberry Fields Forever
*Writer(s): Lennon/McCartney*

Let me take you down,
Cause I'm going to Strawberry Fields.
Nothing is real
And nothing to get hung about.
Strawberry Fields forever.

Living is easy with eyes closed
Misunderstanding all you see.
It's getting hard to be someone.
But it all works out,
It doesn't matter much to me.

Let me take you down,
Cause I'm going to Strawberry Fields.
Nothing is real
And nothing to get hung about.
Strawberry Fields forever.

No one I think is in my tree,
I mean it must be high or low.
That is you can't you know tune in.
But it's all right.
That is I think it's not too bad.

Let me take you down,
Cause I'm going to Strawberry Fields.
Nothing is real
And nothing to get hung about.
Strawberry Fields forever.

Always know, sometimes think it's me,
But you know I know when it's a dream.
I think a no will mean a yes
But it's all wrong.
That is I think I disagree.

Let me take you down,
Cause I'm going to Strawberry Fields.
Nothing is real
And nothing to get hung about.
Strawberry Fields forever.
Strawberry Fields forever.

## 9. Penny Lane
*Writer(s): Lennon/McCartney*

In Penny Lane there is a barber showing photographs
Of every head he's had the pleasure to know.
And all the people that come and go
Stop and say 'Hello'.

On the corner is a banker with a motorcar,
The little children laugh at him behind his back.
And the banker never wears a mack
In the pouring rain - very strange.

Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes,
There beneath the blue suburban skies
I sit, and meanwhile back

In Penny Lane there is a fireman with an hourglass
And in his pocket is a portrait of the Queen.
He likes to keep his fire engine clean,
It's a clean machine.

Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes,
Four of fish and finger pies
In summer meanwhile back

Behind the shelter in the middle of the roundabout
The pretty nurse is selling poppies from a tray.
And though she feels as if she's in a play
She is anyway.

Penny Lane, the barber shaves another customer,
We see the banker sitting waiting for a trim
Then the fireman rushes in
From the pouring rain - very strange.

Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes,
There beneath the blue suburban skies
I sit, and meanwhile back
Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes,
There beneath the blue suburban skies...
Penny Lane!

## 10. Baby You’re a Rich Man
*Writer(s): Lennon/McCartney*

How does it feel to be one of the beautiful people
Now that you know who you are
What do you want to be

Friend have you traveled very far
(Far as the eye can see).

How does it feel to be one of the beautiful people
How often have you been there

(Often enough to know)
What did you see when you were there

(Nothing that doesn't show)

Baby you're a rich man
Baby you're a rich man
Baby you're a rich man too
You keep all your money in a big brown bag inside the zoo - what a thing to do

Baby you're a rich man
Baby you're a rich man
Baby you're a rich man too.

How does it feel to be one of the beautiful people
Tuned to a natural E
(Happy to be that way)

Now that you've found another key
What are you going to play

Baby you're a rich man
Baby you're a rich man
Baby you're a rich man too
You keep all your money in a big brown bag inside a zoo
What a thing to do

Baby you're a rich man
Baby you're a rich man
Baby you're a rich man too...

## 11. All You Need is Love
*Writer(s): Lennon/McCartney*

Love, love, love.
Love, love, love,

Love, love, love

There's nothing you can do that can't be done.
Nothing you can sing that can't be sung.
Nothing you can say but you can learn how to play the game
It's easy.

There's nothing you can make that can't be made.
No one you can save that can't be saved.
Nothing you can do but you can learn how to be you in time
It's easy.

All you need is love
All you need is love,
All you need is love, love
Love is all you need.

All you need is love
All you need is love,
All you need is love, love
Love is all you need.

There's nothing you can know that isn't known.
Nothing you can see that isn't shown.
Nowhere you can be that isn't where you're meant to be.
It's easy.

All you need is love
All you need is love,
All you need is love, love
Love is all you need.

All you need is love
All together now!
All you need is love
Everybody!
All you need is love, love
Love is all you need.
