## Recording Context
* **Location:** EMI Studios (Abbey Road), London; Pathé Marconi, Paris (Can't Buy Me Love).
* **The Film Tie-in:** The first side of the LP contains songs featured in the soundtrack of their motion picture. The title itself was a "Ringo-ism"—a malapropism uttered by Ringo after a long day of work that John immediately seized upon as a song title.
* **Spiritual/Individual State:** * **The "Closed Circle":** This is the height of their "us against the world" mentality. They are trapped in hotel rooms and cars, which bonds them tightly but also begins to create a sense of isolation from reality.
    * **John Lennon:** This is John’s era of absolute dominance. He wrote the lion's share of the album (10 out of 13 tracks), displaying a sharp, wordplay-heavy wit and a growing mastery of the middle-eight.
    * **Paul McCartney:** While John dominates the quantity, Paul provides the "global" hits like "Can't Buy Me Love" and the sophisticated "And I Love Her," showing his evolution into a master of the ballad.
    * **George Harrison:** The introduction of the Rickenbacker 360/12 (12-string guitar) defines the "jangly" sound of this album and would go on to influence The Byrds and the entire folk-rock movement.

## Tracks

### A Hard Day's Night

Written By: Lennon/McCartney

(Opening Chord)

It's been a hard day's night
And I've been working like a dog
It's been a hard day's night
I should be sleeping like a log

But when I get home to you
I find the things that you do
Will make me feel alright

You know I work all day
To get you money to buy you things
And it's worth it just to hear you say
You're gonna give me everything

So why on earth should I moan?
'Cause when I get you alone
You know I feel okay

When I'm home, everything seems to be right
When I'm home, feeling you holding me tight, tight, yeah

It's been a hard day's night
And I've been working like a dog
It's been a hard day's night
I should be sleeping like a log

But when I get home to you
I find the things that you do
Will make me feel alright, ow!

(Guitar Solo)

So why on earth should I moan?
'Cause when I get you alone
You know I feel okay

When I'm home, everything seems to be right
When I'm home, feeling you holding me tight, tight, yeah

It's been a hard day's night
And I've been working like a dog
It's been a hard day's night
I should be sleeping like a log

But when I get home to you
I find the things that you do
Will make me feel alright
You know I feel alright
You know I feel alright



### 2. I Should Have Known Better
*Writer(s): Lennon/McCartney*

I should have known better with a girl like you
That I would love everything that you do
And I do, hey, hey, hey, and I do

Whoa, oh, I never realized what a kiss could be
This could only happen to me
Can't you see, can't you see?

That when I tell you that I love you, oh
You're gonna say you love me too, oh
And when I ask you to be mine
You're gonna say you love me too

So, oh, I should have realized a lot of things before
If this is love you've gotta give me more
Give me more, hey, hey, hey, give me more

I should have known better with a girl like you
That I would love everything that you do
And I do, hey, hey, hey, and I do

Whoa, oh, I never realized what a kiss could be
This could only happen to me
Can't you see, can't you see?

That when I tell you that I love you, oh
You're gonna say you love me too, oh
And when I ask you to be mine
You're gonna say you love me too
You love me too, you love me too
You love me too



### 3. If I Fell
*Writer(s): Lennon/McCartney*

If I fell in love with you
Would you promise to be true
And help me understand?
'Cause I've been in love before
And I found that love was more
Than just holding hands

If I give my heart to you
I must be sure
From the very start
That you would love me more than her

If I trust in you oh please
Don't run and hide
If I love you too oh please
Don't hurt my pride like her

'Cause I couldn't stand the pain
And I would be sad if our new love was in vain

So I hope you see that I
Would love to love you
And that she will cry
When she learns we are two

'Cause I couldn't stand the pain
And I would be sad if our new love was in vain

So I hope you see that I
Would love to love you
And that she will cry
When she learns we are two
If I fell in love with you



## 4. I'm Happy Just to Dance with You
*Writer(s): Lennon/McCartney*

Before this dance is through
I think I'll love you too
I'm so happy when you're dancing with me

I don't want to kiss or hold your hand
If it's funny, try and understand
There is really nothing else I'd rather do
'Cause I'm happy just to dance with you

I don't need to hug or hold you tight
I just want to dance with you all night
In this world there's nothing I would rather do
'Cause I'm happy just to dance with you

Just to dance with you
Is everything I need
Before this dance is through
I think I'll love you too
I'm so happy when you're dancing with me

If somebody tries to take my place
Let's pretend we're in some other space
There is really nothing else I'd rather do
'Cause I'm happy just to dance with you

Just to dance with you
Is everything I need
Before this dance is through
I think I'll love you too
I'm so happy when you're dancing with me

If somebody tries to take my place
Let's pretend we're in some other space
There is really nothing else I'd rather do
'Cause I'm happy just to dance with you
No, oh, 'cause I'm happy just to dance with you
Oh, oh, oh...



## 5. And I Love Her
*Writer(s): McCartney/Lennon*

I give her all my love
That's all I do
And if you saw my love
You'd love her too
I love her

She gives me everything
And tenderly
The kiss my lover brings
She brings to me
And I love her

A love like ours
Could never die
As long as I
Have you near me

Bright are the stars that shine
Dark is the sky
I know this love of mine
Will never die
And I love her

(Guitar Solo)

Bright are the stars that shine
Dark is the sky
I know this love of mine
Will never die
And I love her... her...



## 6. Tell Me Why
*Writer(s): Lennon/McCartney*

Tell me why you cried, and why you lied to me
Tell me why you cried, and why you lied to me

Well, I gave you everything I had
But you left me sitting on my own
Did you have to treat me oh so bad
All I do is hang my head and moan

Tell me why you cried, and why you lied to me
Tell me why you cried, and why you lied to me

If it's something that I've said or done
Tell me what and I'll apologize
I'm so sorry I'm the unlucky one
I could see the mist before my eyes

Tell me why you cried, and why you lied to me
Tell me why you cried, and why you lied to me

Is it anything I'm gonna do?
No, no, no!
Is it anything I'm gonna say?
No, no, no!

Tell me why you cried, and why you lied to me
Tell me why you cried, and why you lied to me

Well, I gave you everything I had
But you left me sitting on my own
Did you have to treat me oh so bad
All I do is hang my head and moan

Tell me why you cried, and why you lied to me
Tell me why you cried, and why you lied to me
(Tell me why!)



## 7. Can't Buy Me Love
*Writer(s): McCartney/Lennon*

Can't buy me love, love
Can't buy me love

I'll buy you a diamond ring my friend
If it makes you feel alright
I'll get you anything my friend
If it makes you feel alright
'Cause I don't care too much for money
Money can't buy me love

I'll give you all I got to give
If you say you love me too
I may not have a lot to give
But what I got I'll give to you
I don't care too much for money
Money can't buy me love

Can't buy me love, everybody tells me so
Can't buy me love, no no no, no!

Say you don't need no diamond ring
And I'll be satisfied
Tell me that you want the kind of thing
That money just can't buy
I don't care too much for money
Money can't buy me love

(Guitar Solo)

Can't buy me love, everybody tells me so
Can't buy me love, no no no, no!

Say you don't need no diamond ring
And I'll be satisfied
Tell me that you want the kind of thing
That money just can't buy
I don't care too much for money
Money can't buy me love

Can't buy me love, love
Can't buy me love, oh!



## 8. Any Time at All
*Writer(s): Lennon/McCartney*

Any time at all, any time at all
Any time at all, all you've gotta do is call
And I'll be there

If you need somebody to love
Just look into my eyes
I'll be there to make you feel right
If you're feeling sorry and sad
I'd really feel bad
But you know I'll pay any price

Any time at all, any time at all
Any time at all, all you've gotta do is call
And I'll be there

If the sun has faded away
I'll try to make it shine
There is nothing I wouldn't do
When you need a shoulder to cry on
I hope it will be mine
Call me tonight and I'll come to you

Any time at all, any time at all
Any time at all, all you've gotta do is call
And I'll be there

Any time at all, any time at all
Any time at all, all you've gotta do is call
And I'll be there
Any time at all, all you've gotta do is call
And I'll be there...



## 9. I'll Cry Instead
*Writer(s): Lennon/McCartney*

I've got a chip on my shoulder that's bigger than my feet
I can't talk to people that I meet
If I could see you now, I'd try to make you sad somehow
But I can't so I'll cry instead

Don't want to cry when there's people there
I get shy when they start to stare
I'm gonna hide myself away, but I'll come back again someday
And when I do you'd better hide all the girls
I'm gonna break their hearts all round the world
Yes, I'm gonna break them in two
And show you what your loving man can do
Until then I'll cry instead

I've got a chip on my shoulder that's bigger than my feet
I can't talk to people that I meet
If I could see you now, I'd try to make you sad somehow
But I can't so I'll cry instead

Don't want to cry when there's people there
I get shy when they start to stare
I'm gonna hide myself away, but I'll come back again someday
And when I do you'd better hide all the girls
I'm gonna break their hearts all round the world
Yes, I'm gonna break them in two
And show you what your loving man can do
Until then I'll cry instead
Yes, I'll cry instead... cry instead



## 10. Things We Said Today
*Writer(s): McCartney/Lennon*

You say you will love me, if I have to go
You'll be thinking of me, somehow I will know
Someday when I'm lonely, wishing you were here
Then I will remember things we said today

You say you'll be mine girl, till the end of time
These days such a kind girl, seems so hard to find
Someday when we're dreaming, deep in love, not a lot to say
Then we will remember things we said today

Me I'm just the lucky kind, love to hear you say that love is love
And though we may be blind, love is here to stay and that's enough

To make you mine girl, be the only one
Love me all the time girl, we'll go on and on
Someday when we're dreaming, deep in love, not a lot to say
Then we will remember things we said today

Me I'm just the lucky kind, love to hear you say that love is love
And though we may be blind, love is here to stay and that's enough

To make you mine girl, be the only one
Love me all the time girl, we'll go on and on
Someday when we're dreaming, deep in love, not a lot to say
Then we will remember things we said today



## 11. When I Get Home
*Writer(s): Lennon/McCartney*

Whoa-ho, whoa-ho
I got a whole lot of things to tell her
When I get home
Come on, out of my way
'Cause I'm gonna see my baby today
I've got a whole lot of things to tell her
When I get home

When I'm getting home tonight
I'm gonna hold her tight
I'm gonna love her till the cows come home
I'll love her more than ever out of sight
And I'm gonna love her with all my might
When I get home

I got a whole lot of things to tell her
When I get home
Come on, if you please
I've got no time for trivialities
I've got a whole lot of things to tell her
When I get home

When I'm getting home tonight
I'm gonna hold her tight
I'm gonna love her till the cows come home
I'll love her more than ever out of sight
And I'm gonna love her with all my might
When I get home

I got a whole lot of things to tell her
When I get home
Whoa-ho, whoa-ho
I got a whole lot of things to tell her
When I get home...



## 12. You Can't Do That
*Writer(s): Lennon/McCartney*

I got something to say that might cause you pain
If I catch you talking to that boy again
I'm gonna let you down and leave you flat
Because I told you before, oh you can't do that

Well, it's the second time I've caught you talking to him
Do I have to tell you that I think it's a sin?
I'm gonna let you down and leave you flat
Because I told you before, oh you can't do that

Everybody's green, 'cause I'm the one who won your love
But if they'd seen, you're talking that way they'd laugh in my face

So please listen to me if you wanna stay mine
I can't help my feelings, I'll go out of my mind
I'm gonna let you down and leave you flat
Because I told you before, oh you can't do that

(Guitar Solo)

Everybody's green, 'cause I'm the one who won your love
But if they'd seen, you're talking that way they'd laugh in my face

So please listen to me if you wanna stay mine
I can't help my feelings, I'll go out of my mind
I'm gonna let you down and leave you flat
Because I told you before, oh you can't do that
You can't do that...



## 13. I'll Be Back
*Writer(s): Lennon/McCartney*

You know, if you break my heart I'll go
But I'll be back again
'Cause I told you once before goodbye
But I came back again

I love you so, I'm the one who wants you
Yes, I'm the one who wants you, oh, oh, oh, oh

You could find better things to do
Than to break my heart again
This time I will try to show that I'm
Not trying to pretend

I thought that you would realize
That if I ran away from you
That you would want me too
But I've got a big surprise, oh, oh, oh, oh

You could find better things to do
Than to break my heart again
This time I will try to show that I'm
Not trying to pretend

I wanna go, but I hate to leave you
You know I hate to leave you, oh, oh, oh, oh

You know, if you break my heart I'll go
But I'll be back again
