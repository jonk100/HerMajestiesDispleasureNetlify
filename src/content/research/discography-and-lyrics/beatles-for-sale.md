# Beatles for Sale (1964)

## Recording Context
* **Location:** EMI Studios (Abbey Road), London.
* **The Fatigue Factor:** Recorded during the height of 1964's global hysteria. The band was physically and mentally exhausted, which is visible on the album cover. To meet the Christmas market deadline, they returned to recording covers (6 out of 14 tracks) for the last time until the *Let It Be* sessions.
* **Spiritual/Individual State:**
    * **The "Tired" Collective:** The manic energy of *A Hard Day's Night* has been replaced by a more somber, autumn-hued reflection.
    * **John Lennon:** Deeply influenced by meeting Bob Dylan in August 1964. His lyrics become more autobiographical and "confessional" (e.g., "I'm a Loser").
    * **Paul McCartney:** Balancing John's darkness with his own "work-song" optimism, though even his contributions (like "I'll Follow the Sun") have a bittersweet, nostalgic quality.
    * **George Harrison:** Continuing to refine his rockabilly influence (Carl Perkins) while leaning into the folk-rock 12-string sound.
    * **Ringo Starr:** Given the spotlight on "Honey Don't," showcasing his affinity for country and rockabilly.

## 1. No Reply
*Writer(s): Lennon/McCartney*

This happened once before
When I came to your door
No reply
They said it wasn't you
But I saw you peep through
Your window

I saw the light, I saw the light
I know that you saw me
'Cause I looked up to see your face

I tried to telephone
They said you were not home
That's a lie
'Cause I know where you've been
And I saw where you've been
In the window

I saw the light, I saw the light
I know that you saw me
'Cause I looked up to see your face

If I were you I'd realize that I
If I were you I'd realize that I
Love you more than any other guy
And I'll forgive the lies that I
Heard before when you gave me no reply

I've tried to telephone
They said you were not home
That's a lie
'Cause I know where you've been
And I saw where you've been
In the window

I saw the light, I saw the light
I know that you saw me
'Cause I looked up to see your face
No reply, no reply

## 2. I'm a Loser
*Writer(s): Lennon/McCartney*

I'm a loser
I'm a loser
And I'm not what I appear to be

Of all the love I have won or have lost
There is one love I should never have crossed
She was a girl in a million, my friend
I should have known she would win in the end

I'm a loser
And I'm not what I appear to be

Although I laugh and I act like a clown
Beneath this mask I am wearing a frown
My tears are falling like rain from the sky
Is it for her or myself that I cry?

I'm a loser
And I'm not what I appear to be

(Harmonica Solo)

What have I done to deserve such a fate?
I realize I have left it too late
And so it's true, loneliness it's a drag
But I'm the loser and I've lost her for sure

I'm a loser
And I'm not what I appear to be

## 3. Baby's in Black
*Writer(s): Lennon/McCartney*

Oh dear, what can I do?
Baby's in black and I'm feeling blue
Tell me, oh what can I do?

She thinks of him and so she dresses in black
And though he'll never come back, she's dressed in black

Oh dear, what can I do?
Baby's in black and I'm feeling blue
Tell me, oh what can I do?

I think of her, but she thinks only of him
And though it's only a whim, she thinks of him

Oh, how long will it take till she sees the mistake she is making?
Dear, what can I do?

Baby's in black and I'm feeling blue
Tell me, oh what can I do?

(Guitar Solo)

Oh, how long will it take till she sees the mistake she is making?
Dear, what can I do?

Baby's in black and I'm feeling blue
Tell me, oh what can I do?

She thinks of him and so she dresses in black
And though he'll never come back, she's dressed in black

Oh dear, what can I do?
Baby's in black and I'm feeling blue
Tell me, oh what can I do?

## 4. Rock and Roll Music
*Writer(s): Chuck Berry*

Just let me hear some of that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
It's got a backbeat, you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
It's gotta be rock and roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me

I've no kick against modern jazz
Unless they try to play it too darn fast
And lose the beauty of the melody
Until they sounded like a symphony

That's why I go for that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
It's got a backbeat, you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
It's gotta be rock and roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me

I took my loved one over 'cross the tracks
So she could hear my man a-wailin' sax
I must admit they have a rockin' band
Man, they were goin' like a hurricane

That's why I go for that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
It's got a backbeat, you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
It's gotta be rock and roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me

Way down South they gave a jubilee
The Georgia crackers helped to set 'em free
They played a drinkin' in a wooden cup
The water taster, he was washin' up

That's why I go for that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
It's got a backbeat, you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
It's gotta be rock and roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me

Don't care to hear 'em play a tango
I'm in no mood to take a mambo
It's way too early for a conga
So keep on a-rockin' that piano

That's why I go for that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
It's got a backbeat, you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
It's gotta be rock and roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me

## 5. I'll Follow the Sun
*Writer(s): McCartney/Lennon*

One day you'll look to see I've gone
For tomorrow may rain, so I'll follow the sun
Some day you'll know I was the one
But tomorrow may rain, so I'll follow the sun

And now the time has come
And so my love I must go
And though I lose a friend
In the end you will know, oh

One day you'll look to see I've gone
For tomorrow may rain, so I'll follow the sun

(Guitar Solo)

And now the time has come
And so my love I must go
And though I lose a friend
In the end you will know, oh

One day you'll look to see I've gone
For tomorrow may rain, so I'll follow the sun
Yes, tomorrow may rain, so I'll follow the sun

*Writer(s): Roy Lee Johnson*

Mister Moonlight!

You came to me one summer night
And from your beam you made my dream come true
Say you'll never leave me
Please, Mister Moonlight

And I believe you, child

On the light because I love you

Say you'll never leave me
Please, Mister Moonlight

(Organ Solo)

And I believe you, child
But I want you to know
That I love you, child
I'm on the light because I love you

On the light because I love you
You came to me one summer night
And from your beam you made my dream come true
Say you'll never leave me
Please, Mister Moonlight
Mister Moonlight, Mister Moonlight

What's been wrong with you? (What's been wrong with you?)

Well, how can you say you will when you won't?
Say you love me then you don't
Tell me, baby, what's the reason why?
Honey, don't!

## 11. Every Little Thing
*Writer(s): Lennon/McCartney*

When I'm walking beside her
People tell me I'm lucky
Yes, I know I'm a lucky guy
I remember the first time
I was lonely without her
Can't stop thinking about her now

Every little thing she does
She does for me, yeah
And you know the things she does
She does for me, yeah

When I'm with her, my sleepy head
On her shoulder at night
I remember the things she said
I can't answer the reasons why

Every little thing she does
She does for me, yeah
And you know the things she does
She does for me, yeah

Every little thing she does
She does for me, yeah
And you know the things she does
She does for me, yeah

## 12. I Don't Want to Spoil the Party
*Writer(s): Lennon/McCartney*

I don't want to spoil the party so I'll go
I would hate my disappointment to show
There's nothing for me here so I will disappear
If she turns up while I'm gone please let me know

I've had a drink or two and I don't care
There's no fun in her not being there
If I'm sour and I'm blue and I'm hurting you
I'll take a walk and look for her everywhere

I wonder what went wrong, I've waited far too long
I think I'll take a walk and look for her

I don't want to spoil the party so I'll go
I would hate my disappointment to show
There's nothing for me here so I will disappear
If she turns up while I'm gone please let me know

(Guitar Solo)

I wonder what went wrong, I've waited far too long
I think I'll take a walk and look for her

I don't want to spoil the party so I'll go
I would hate my disappointment to show
There's nothing for me here so I will disappear
If she turns up while I'm gone please let me know

## 13. What You're Doing
*Writer(s): McCartney/Lennon*

Look what you're doing
I'm feeling blue and lonely
Would it be too much to ask of you
What you're doing to me?

You got me running
And there's no fun in it
Stop it, I'm begging of you
What you're doing to me?

I've been waiting here for you
Wishing you were coming too
Why do you keep me waiting here?
I'm so lonely

Look what you're doing
I'm feeling blue and lonely
Would it be too much to ask of you
What you're doing to me?

(Guitar Solo)

I've been waiting here for you
Wishing you were coming too
Why do you keep me waiting here?
I'm so lonely

Look what you're doing
I'm feeling blue and lonely
Would it be too much to ask of you
What you're doing to me?
What you're doing to me?
What you're doing to me?

## 14. Everybody's Trying to Be My Baby
*Writer(s): Carl Perkins*

Well, they took some honey from a hollow tree
Killed a bad old bear with a hickory
Took a little girl and I brought her home
To have a little honey of my very own

Well, everybody's trying to be my baby
Everybody's trying to be my baby
Everybody's trying to be my baby, now
(Wha-ho, wha-ho)

Well, I went out last night, I didn't stay late
'Fore I got home I had a nineteenth date
I came home and I went to bed
Nineteen women knocking at my head

Well, everybody's trying to be my baby
Everybody's trying to be my baby
Everybody's trying to be my baby, now

(Guitar Solo)

Well, I went out last night, I didn't stay late
'Fore I got home I had a nineteenth date
I came home and I went to bed
Nineteen women knocking at my head

Well, everybody's trying to be my baby
Everybody's trying to be my baby
Everybody's trying to be my baby, now
