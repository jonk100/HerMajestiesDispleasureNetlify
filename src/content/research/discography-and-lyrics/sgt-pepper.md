# Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (1967)

## Recording Context
* **Location:** EMI Studios (Abbey Road), London.
* **The Concept:** Paul McCartney conceived the idea of the Beatles "becoming" another band to escape the pressures of being the Fab Four. This allowed them to experiment with costumes, alter-egos, and sounds that were previously outside their pop identity.
* **Spiritual/Individual State:**
    * **The Collective:** Having permanently retired from touring in 1966, the band had unlimited time to create. They spent over 700 hours in the studio, using four-track recording technology to create dense, multi-layered "soundscapes."
    * **John Lennon:** Drawing inspiration from his childhood ("Strawberry Fields Forever" - recorded during these sessions), circus posters ("Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite!"), and the daily news ("A Day in the Life").
    * **Paul McCartney:** The primary driver of the album's structure and sonic optimism, exploring music hall traditions, Victorian storytelling, and avant-garde tape effects.
    * **George Harrison:** Deeply immersed in Indian philosophy and music, contributing the raga-influenced "Within You Without You," which serves as the album's spiritual centerpiece.
    * **Ringo Starr:** Delivering one of his most beloved vocal performances as the character "Billy Shears" in "With a Little Help from My Friends."

## 1. Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band
*Writer(s): Lennon/McCartney*

It was twenty years ago today, that
Sgt. Pepper taught the band to play
They've been going in and out of style
But they're guaranteed to raise a smile.
So may I introduce to you
The act you've known for all these years,
Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band.

We're Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band,
We hope you will enjoy the show,
We're Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band,
Sit back and let the evening go.
Sgt. Pepper's lonely, Sgt. Pepper's lonely,
Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band.

It's wonderful to be here,
It's certainly a thrill.
You're such a lovely audience,
We'd like to take you home with us,
We'd love to take you home.

I don't really want to stop the show,
But I thought you might like to know,
That the singer's going to sing a song,
And he wants you all to sing along.
So may I introduce to you
The one only Billy Shears
And Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band.

## 2. With a Little Help From My Friends
*Writer(s): Lennon/McCartney*

What would you think if I sang out of tune,
Would you stand up and walk out on me.
Lend me your ears and I'll sing you a song,
And I'll try not to sing out of key.

I get by with a little help from my friends,
I get high with a little help from my friends,
I'm gonna try with a little help from my friends.

What do I do when my love is away.
(Does it worry you to be alone)
How do I feel by the end of the day
(Are you sad because you're on your own)

No I get by with a little help from my friends,
I get high with a little help from my friends,
Oh, I'm gonna try with a little help from my friends.

Do you need anybody,
I need somebody to love.
Could it be anybody
I want somebody to love.

Do you believe in a love at first sight,
Yes I'm certain that it happens all the time.
What do you see when you turn out the light,
I can't tell you, but I know it's mine.

Oh I get by with a little help from my friends.
I get high with a little help from my friends,
Oh I'm gonna try with a little help from my friends.

Do you need anybody,
I just need somebody to love,
Could it be anybody,
I want somebody to love.

Oh I get by with a little help from my friends,
Mm I'm gonna try with a little help from my friends,
Oh I get high with a little help from my friends,
Yes I get by with a little help from my friends.

## 3. Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds
*Writer(s): Lennon/McCartney*

Picture yourself in a boat on a river,
With tangerine trees and marmalade skies
Somebody calls you, you answer quite slowly,
A girl with kaleidoscope eyes.

Cellophane flowers of yellow and green,
Towering over your head.
Look for the girl with the sun in her eyes,
And she's gone.

Lucy in the sky with diamonds,
Lucy in the sky with diamonds,
Lucy in the sky with diamonds, ah.

Follow her down to a bridge by a fountain
Where rocking horse people eat marshmallow pies,
Everyone smiles as you drift past the flowers,
That grow so incredibly high.

Newspaper taxis appear on the shore,
Waiting to take you away.
Climb in the back with your head in the clouds,
And you're gone.

Lucy in the sky with diamonds,
Lucy in the sky with diamonds,
Lucy in the sky with diamonds, ah.

Picture yourself on a train in a station,
With plasticine porters with looking glass ties,
Suddenly someone is there at the turnstile,
The girl with kaleidoscope eyes.

Lucy in the sky with diamonds,
Lucy in the sky with diamonds,
Lucy in the sky with diamonds, ah.

## 4. Getting Better
*Writer(s): Lennon/McCartney*

It's getting better all the time
I used to get mad at my school
The teachers who taught me weren't cool
Holding me down, turning me round
Filling me up with your rules.

I've got to admit it's getting better
It's a little better all the time
I have to admit it's getting better
It's getting better since you've been mine.

Me used to be angry young man
Me hiding me head in the sand
You gave me the word
I finally heard
I'm doing the best that I can.

I admit it's getting better
It's a little better all the time yes
I admit it's getting better
It's getting better since you've been mine.

I used to be cruel to my woman
I beat her and kept her apart from the
Things that she loved
Man I was mean but I'm changing my scene
And I'm doing the best that I can.

I admit it's getting better
A little better all the time
Yes I admit it's getting better
It's getting better since you've been mine.
Getting so much better all the time.

## 5. Fixing a Hole
*Writer(s): Lennon/McCartney*

I'm fixing a hole where the rain gets in
And stops my mind from wandering
Where it will go.
I'm filling in the cracks that ran through the door
And kept my mind from wandering
Where it will go.

And it really doesn't matter if I'm wrong
I'm right
Where I belong I'm right
Where I belong.

See the people standing there who
Disagree and never win
And wonder why they don't get in my door.

I'm painting the room in a colorful way
And when my mind is wandering
There I will go.

And it doesn't really matter if I'm wrong I'm right
Where I belong I'm right
Where I belong.

Silly people run around they worry me
And never ask me why they don't get past my door.

I'm taking the time for a number of things
That weren't important yesterday
And I still go.

I'm fixing a hole where the rain gets in
And stops my mind from wandering
Where it will go.

## 6. She’s Leaving Home
*Writer(s): Lennon/McCartney*

Wednesday morning at five o'clock as the day begins
Silently closing her bedroom door
Leaving the note that she hoped would say more
She goes downstairs to the kitchen
Clutching her handkerchief
Quietly turning the backdoor key
Stepping outside she is free.

She (We gave her most of our lives)
Is leaving (Sacrificed most of our lives)
Home (We gave her everything money could buy)
She's leaving home after living alone
For so many years.
Bye, bye.

Father snores as his wife gets into her dressing gown
Picks up the letter that's lying there
Standing alone at the top of stairs
She breaks down and cries to her husband
Daddy our baby's gone.
Why would she treat us so thoughtlessly
How could she do this to me.

She (We never thought of ourselves)
Is leaving (Never a thought for ourselves)
Home (We struggled hard all our lives to get by)
She's leaving home after living alone
For so many years.
Bye, bye.

Friday morning at nine o'clock she is far away
Waiting to keep the appointment she made
Meeting a man from the motor trade.

She (What did we do that was wrong)
Is leaving (We didn't know it was wrong)
Home (Fun is the one thing that money can't buy)
Something inside that was always denied
For so many years.
Bye, bye.
She's leaving home bye bye.

## 7. Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite!
*Writer(s): Lennon/McCartney*

For the benefit of Mr. Kite
there will be a show tonight on trampoline
The Hendersons will all be there
late of Pablo Fanques fair, what a scene
Over men and horses hoops and garters
and lastly through a hogshead of real fire
In this way Mr. K will challenge the world

The celebrated Mr. K
performs his feats on Saturday at Bishopsgate
The Hendersons will dance and sing
as Mr. Kite flies through the ring, don't be late
Messrs. K. and H. assure the public
their production will be second to none
And of course Henry the Horse dances the waltz

The band begins at ten to six
when Mr. K performs his tricks without a sound
And Mr. H will demonstrate
ten summersets he'll undertake on solid ground
Having been some days in preparation
a splendid time is guaranteed for all
And tonight Mr. Kite is topping the bill

## 8. Within You Without You
*Writer(s): Harrison*

We were talking - about the space between us all
And the people - who hide themselves behind a wall of illusion
Never glimpse the truth - then it’s far too late - when they pass away.

We were talking - about the love we all could share - when we find it
To try our best to hold it there - with our love
With our love - we could save the world - if they only knew.

Try to realize it's all within yourself
No-one else can make you change
And to see you're really only very small,
And life flows on within you and without you.

We were talking - about the love that's gone so cold and the people,
Who gain the world and lose their soul -
They don't know - they can't see - are you one of them?

When you've seen beyond yourself -
Then you may find peace of mind, is waiting there -
And the time will come when you see we're all one,
And life flows on within you and without you.

## 9. When I’m Sixty-Four
*Writer(s): Lennon/McCartney*

When I get older losing my hair,
Many years from now.
Will you still be sending me a Valentine
Birthday greetings bottle of wine.

If I'd been out till quarter to three
Would you lock the door.
Will you still need me, will you still feed me,
When I'm sixty-four.

You'll be older too,
And if you say the word,
I could stay with you.

I could be handy, mending a fuse
When your lights have gone.
You can knit a sweater by the fireside
Sunday morning go for a ride.
Doing the garden, digging the weeds,
Who could ask for more.

Will you still need me, will you still feed me,
When I'm sixty-four.

Every summer we can rent a cottage,
In the Isle of Wight, if it's not too dear
We shall scrimp and save
Grandchildren on your knee
Vera Chuck & Dave

Send me a postcard, drop me a line,
Stating point of view
Indicate precisely what you mean to say
Yours sincerely, wasting away
Give me your answer, fill in a form
Mine for evermore.
Will you still need me, will you still feed me
When I'm sixty-four

## 10. Lovely Rita
*Writer(s): Lennon/McCartney*

Lovely Rita meter maid.
Lovely Rita meter maid.

Lovely Rita meter maid.
Nothing can come between us,
When it gets dark I tow your heart away.

Standing by a parking meter,
When I caught a glimpse of Rita,
Filling in a ticket in her little white book.
In a cap she looked much older,
And the bag across her shoulder
Made her look a little like a military man.

Lovely Rita meter maid,
May I inquire discreetly,
When you are free,
To take some tea with me.

Took her out and tried to win her,
Had a laugh and over dinner,
Told her I would really like to see her again.

Got the bill and Rita paid it
Took her home and nearly made it
Sitting on a sofa with a sister or two.

Oh, lovely Rita meter maid,
Where would I be without you.
Give us a wink and make me think of you

## 11. Good Morning Good Morning
*Writer(s): Lennon/McCartney*

Nothing to do to save his life call his wife in
Nothing to say but what a day how's your boy been
Nothing to do it's up to you
I've got nothing to say but it's O.K.
Good morning, good morning, good morning...

Going to work don't want to go feeling low down
Heading for home you start to roam then you're in town
Everybody knows there's nothing doing
Everything is closed it's like a ruin
Everyone you see is half asleep.
And you're on your own you're in the street.

After a while you start to smile now you feel cool.
Then you decide to take a walk by the old school.
Nothing had changed it's still the same
I've got nothing to say but it's O.K.
Good morning, good morning, good morning...

People running round it's five o'clock.
Everywhere in town it's getting dark.
Everyone you see is full of life.
It's time for tea and meet the wife.
Somebody needs to know the time, glad that I'm here.
Watching the skirts you start to flirt now you're in gear.
Go to a show you hope she goes.
I've got nothing to say but it's O.K.

Good morning, good morning, good morning..

## 13. A Day in the Life
*Writer(s): Lennon/McCartney*

I read the news today oh boy
About a lucky man who made the grade
And though the news was rather sad
Well I just had to laugh
I saw the photograph

He blew his mind out in a car
He didn't notice that the lights had changed
A crowd of people stood and stared
They'd seen his face before
Nobody was really sure
If he was from the House of Lords.

I saw a film today oh boy
The English Army had just won the war
A crowd of people turned away
But I just had to look
Having read the book.

I'd love to turn you on ...

Woke up, fell out of bed,
Dragged a comb across my head
Found my way downstairs and drank a cup,
And looking up I noticed I was late.

Found my coat and grabbed my hat
Made the bus in seconds flat
Found my way upstairs and had a smoke,
And somebody spoke and I went into a dream.

I read the news today oh boy
Four thousand holes in Blackburn, Lancashire
And though the holes were rather small
They had to count them all
Now they know how many holes it takes
To fill the Albert Hall.

I'd love to turn you on.
