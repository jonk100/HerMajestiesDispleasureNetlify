# Help! (1965)

## Recording Context
* **Location:** EMI Studios (Abbey Road), London; Twickenham Film Studios; Location recording in the Bahamas.
* **The "Haze":** This period is often referred to by the band as their "marijuana breakfast" phase. They were frequently high during filming and recording, which led to more giggling but also expanded their musical horizons beyond the tight pop structures of earlier albums.
* **Spiritual/Individual State:**
    * **John Lennon:** Entering his "Fat Elvis" period. He felt trapped by his marriage and the overwhelming pressure of fame. The title track is a genuine cry for assistance, marking a major shift from "she loves you" to "I need help."
    * **Paul McCartney:** Continuing his rapid ascent as a composer. He delivers the most covered song in history ("Yesterday") on this album, effectively separating himself as a solo artist within the group context for the first time.
    * **George Harrison:** While still struggling to get songs on albums, he is exposed to Indian culture during the filming of the restaurant scene in *Help!*, leading to his purchase of a sitar—a pivotal moment for the band's future sound.

## 1. Help!
*Writer(s): Lennon/McCartney*

Help! I need somebody, 
Help! Not just anybody, 
Help! You know I need someone, 
Help! 

When I was younger, so much younger than today, 
I never needed anybody's help in any way, 
But now these days are gone and I'm not so self assured, 
Now I find I've changed my mind I've opened up the doors. 

Help me if you can, I'm feeling down, 
And I do appreciate you being around, 
Help me get my feet back on the ground, 
Won't you please please help me? 

And now my life has changed in oh so many ways, 
My independence seems to vanish in the haze, 
But every now and then I feel so insecure, 
I know that I just need you like I've never done before. 

Help me if you can, I'm feeling down, 
And I do appreciate you being ‘round, 
Help me get my feet back on the ground, 
Won't you please please help me? 

When I was younger, so much younger than today, 
I never needed anybody's help in any way, 
But now these days are gone and I'm not so self assured, 
Now I find I've changed my mind I've opened up the doors. 

Help me if you can, I'm feeling down, 
And I do appreciate you being around, 
Help me get my feet back on the ground, 
Won't you please please help me? 

Help me. Help me. Ooh, ooh, ooh!

## 2. The Night Before
*Writer(s): Lennon/McCartney*

We said our goodbyes (the night before), 
Love was in your eyes 
Now today I find, you have changed your mind, 
Treat me like you did the night before. 

Were you telling lies (the night before)? 
Was I so unwise (the night before)? 

When I held you near, you were so sincere, 
Treat me like you did the night before. 

Last night is the night I will remember you by, 
When I think of things you did it makes me wanna cry. 

We said our goodbyes (the night before), 
Love was in your eyes (the night before) 
Now today I find, you have changed your mind, 
Treat me like you did the night before. 

Last night is the night I will remember you by, 
When I think of things you did it makes me wanna cry. 

Were you telling lies (the night before)? 
Was I so unwise (the night before)? 

When I held you near, you were so sincere, 
Treat me like you did the night before

## 3. You’ve Got to Hide Your Love Away
*Writer(s): Lennon/McCartney*

Here I stand with head in hand, 
Turn my face to the wall. 
If she's gone I can't go on, 
Feeling two foot small. 

Everywhere people stare, 
Each and every day. 
I can see them laugh at me, 
And I hear them say. 

Hey, you've got to hide your love away. 
Hey, you've got to hide your love away. 

How can I even try, 
I can never win, 
Hearing them, seeing them, 
In the state I'm in. 

How could she say to me 
Love will find a way? 
Gather round all you clowns 
Let me hear you say. 

Hey, you've got to hide your love away. 
Hey, you've got to hide your love away.

## 4. I Need You
*Writer(s): Harrison*

You don't realize how much I need you, 
Love you all the time and never leave you, 
Please come on back to me, I'm lonely as can be, I need you. 

Said you had a thing or two to tell me, 
How was I to know you would upset me. 
I didn't realize as I looked in your eyes 

You told me, oh yes you told me 
You don't want my lovin' anymore. 
That's when it hurt me and feeling like this 
I just don't go on anymore. 

Please remember how I feel about you, 
I could never really live without you, 
So, come on back and see 
Just what you mean to me 
I need you. 

But when you told me you don’t want my lovin’ anymore, 
That’s when it hurt me and feeling like this, I just can’t go on anymore. 
Please remember how I feel about you 
I could lnever really live without you 
Some come on back and see just what you mean to me, 
I need you. 
I need you, I need you.

*Writer(s): Lennon/McCartney*

For I have got another girl, another girl, 
You're making me say that I've got nobody but you, 
But as from today I've got somebody that's new, 
I ain't no fool and I don't take what I don't want, 

For I have got another girl, another girl. 
She's sweeter than all the girls and I've met quite a few, 
Nobody in the world can do what she can do, 
And so I'm telling you this time you'd better stop, 

For I have got another girl. 
Another girl, who will love me till the end, 
Through thick and thin she will always be my friend.

But as from today well I've seen somebody that's new,

## 8. Act Naturally
*Writer(s): J. Russell-V. Morrison*

They're gonna put me in the movies 
They're gonna make a big star out of me 
We'll make a film about a man that's sad and lonely 
And all I gotta say is act naturally 

Well, I'll bet you I'm gonna be a big star 
Might win an Oscar you can never tell 
The movies gonna make me a big star 
Cause I can play the part so well 

Well I hope you come and see me in the movies 
Then I know that you will plainly see 
The biggest fool that ever hit the big time 
And all I gotta do is act naturally 

We'll make a scene about a man that's sad and lonely 
And begging down upon his bended knee 
I'll play the part but I won't need rehearsal 
All I gotta do is act naturally 

Well, I'll bet you I'm gonna be a big star 
Might win an Oscar you can never tell 
The movies gonna make me a big star 
Cause I can play the part so well

Then I’ll know that you will plainly see 
The biggest fool that ever hit the big time 
And all I gotta do is act naturally

## 9. It’s Only Love
*Writer(s): Lennon/McCartney*

I get high when I see you go by, 
My oh my, 
When you sigh, my, my inside just flies, 
Butterflies, 
Why am I so shy when I'm beside you? 

It's only love and that is all, 
Why should I feel the way I do? 

It's only love and that is all, 
But it's so hard loving you. 

Is it right that you and I should fight 
Every night? 
Just the sight of you makes my time bright, 
Very bright. 

Haven't I the right to make it up, girl? 
It's only love and that is all, 
Why should I feel the way I do? 

It's only love and that is all, 
But it's so hard loving you. 
Yes, it's so hard loving you, oh.

If you let me take your heart I will prove to you, 
We will never be apart if I'm part of you, 
Open up your eyes now, tell me what you see,

Big and black the clouds may be, time will pass away, 
If you put your trust in me I'll make bright your day. 

Look into these eyes now, tell me what you see, 
Don't you realize now what you see is me.

I've just seen a face I can't forget the time or place where we just met, 
She's just the girl for me and I want all the world to see we've met. 

Had it been another day I might have looked the other ways and, 
I'd have never been aware but as it is I'll dream of her tonight. 

Falling, yes I am falling, 
And she keeps calling me back again. 

I have never known the like of this I've been alone and I have 
Missed things and kept out of sight for other girls were never quite like this. 

Falling, yes I am falling, 
And she keeps calling me back again.

Yesterday, all my troubles seemed so far away 
Now it looks as though they're here to stay 
Oh, I believe in yesterday 

Suddenly, I'm not half the man I used to be 
There's a shadow hanging over me 
oh, yesterday came suddenly 

Why she had to go I don't know, she wouldn't say 
I said something wrong, now I long for yesterday 

Yesterday, love was such an easy game to play 
Now I need a place to hide away 
oh, I believe in yesterday 

Why she had to go I don't know, she wouldn't say 
I said something wrong, now I long for yesterday 

Yesterday, love was such an easy game to play 
Now I need a place to hide away 
oh, I believe in yesterday, Mm
