# With The Beatles (1963)

## Recording Context
* **Location:** EMI Studios (Abbey Road), London.
* **The "Sophomore" Pressure:** Recorded only four months after the release of *Please Please Me*, this album was created in the heat of a grueling tour schedule. Unlike the first album, which was captured in a single day, these sessions were spread over three months.
* **Spiritual/Individual State:**
    * **The Collective:** The band was high on their first taste of massive success but physically exhausted. They were essentially "working-class musicians" at this stage, focused on fulfilling their contract and keeping the momentum alive.
    * **George Harrison:** Significant for being the first album to feature a Harrison original ("Don't Bother Me"), signaling his emergence as a third songwriter.
    * **Lennon/McCartney:** They were consciously trying to write "hits" to satisfy their growing fanbase, heavily influenced by the Motown and R&B records they were importing from America.

## 4. Don’t Bother Me
*Writer(s): Harrison*

Since she's been gone I want no one to come knocking at my door
Don't take the time to change my mind because I'm lonely anymore
I've got a lot of things to learn
And till they're done I've got no time to burn
So go away, leave me alone, don't bother me

I can't believe that she would leave me on my own and sorrow
I've given her everything a boy could give, maybe tomorrow
She'll find her way home to me
And until then in misery I'll stay
Go away, leave me alone, don't bother me

I've got a lot of things to learn
And till they're done I've got no time to burn
So go away, leave me alone, don't bother me

## 5. Little Child
*Writer(s): Lennon/McCartney*

Little child, little child
Little child, won't you dance with me?
I'm so sad and lonely
Baby take a chance with me

If you want me to
I will dance with you
And after the dance
I'll be taking a chance with you

Little child, little child
Little child, won't you dance with me?
I'm so sad and lonely
Baby take a chance with me

## 6. Till There Was You
*Writer(s): Meredith Willson*

There were bells on a hill
But I never heard them ringing
No, I never heard them at all
Till there was you

There were birds in the sky
But I never saw them winging
No, I never saw them at all
Till there was you

Then there was music and wonderful roses
They tell me in sweet fragrant meadows of dawn and dew

There was love all around
But I never heard it singing
No, I never heard it at all
Till there was you

## 7. Please Mister Postman
*Writer(s): Georgia Dobbins/William Garrett/Freddie Gorman/Brian Holland/Robert Bateman*

(Wait) Oh yes, wait a minute Mister Postman
(Wait) Wait, Mister Postman

Mister Postman look and see
Is there a letter in your bag for me?
I've been waiting a long, long time
Since I heard from that girl of mine

There must be some word today
From my girlfriend so far away
Please Mister Postman look and see
If there's a letter, a letter for me

I've been standing here waiting Mister Postman
So patiently
For just a card or just a letter
Saying she's returning home to me

Mister Postman look and see
Is there a letter in your bag for me?
I've been waiting a long, long time
Since I heard from that girl of mine

## 8. Roll Over Beethoven
*Writer(s): Chuck Berry*

I'm gonna write a little letter
Gonna mail it to my local DJ
It's a rocking little record
I want my jockey to play
Roll over Beethoven, I gotta hear it again today

You know my temperature's rising
And the jukebox blows a fuse
My heart's a-beating rhythm
And my soul keeps singing the blues
Roll over Beethoven and tell Tchaikovsky the news

I got a rocking pneumonia
I need a shot of rhythm and blues
I think I got it from the writer
Sitting by the rhythm reviews
Roll over Beethoven rockin' in two by two

## 9. Hold Me Tight
*Writer(s): Lennon/McCartney*

It feels so right now, hold me tight
Tell me I'm the only one
And then I might, never be the lonely one
So hold me tight, tonight, tonight
It's you, you you you

Hold me tight, let me go on loving you
Tonight, tonight, making love to only you
So hold me tight, tonight, tonight
It's you, you you you

Don't know what it means to hold you tight
Being here alone tonight with you
It feels so right now, hold me tight
Tell me I'm the only one
And then I might, never be the lonely one
So hold me tight, tonight, tonight
It's you, you you you

I don't like you, but I love you
Seems that I'm always thinking of you
Oh, oh, oh, you treat me badly
I love you madly
You've really got a hold on me

Don't want to kiss you, but I need you
Oh, oh, oh, you do me wrong now
My love is strong now
You've really got a hold on me

## 12. Devil in Her Heart
*Writer(s): Richard Drapkin*

She's got the devil in her heart
But her eyes they sparkle like a star
She's got the devil in her heart
No no no, this can't be so

I'll take the chance with a girl like her
To experience what a girl like her can do
She's got the devil in her heart
No no no, this can't be so

No, she's an angel sent to me
And I'm gonna love her till the end
She's got the devil in her heart
But her eyes they sparkle like a star

## 13. Not a Second Time
*Writer(s): Lennon/McCartney*

You're giving me the same old line
I'm wondering why
You hurt me then, you're back again
No, no, no, not a second time

You left me with a broken heart
I was alone but I was smart
You hurt me then, you're back again
No, no, no, not a second time

Not a second time, no, no, no, not a second time
