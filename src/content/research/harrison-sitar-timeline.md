## **George Harrison's Sitar Journey and Influences**

### **Early to Mid-1960s: The First Spark**

- **Brian Jones’ Role:**  
  Brian Jones of The Rolling Stones was an early British rock musician deeply interested in Indian classical music. He studied sitar with Ravi Shankar and became a pioneer in bringing the instrument into Western rock. His enthusiasm and musicianship introduced the sitar sound to the UK rock scene and directly inspired George Harrison to explore it.

- **Harrison’s First Exposure:**  
  Influenced by Brian Jones’ sitar playing and growing fascination with Indian sounds, Harrison bought his first sitar in 1965. This marked the beginning of his journey from casual curiosity toward serious study. That same year, he experimented with sitar on the Beatles track “Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown),” the first use of the instrument in a mainstream Western pop song.

### **Mid-1960s: Cultural Context and Indirect Influences**

- **David Crosby and the West Coast Psychedelic Scene:**  
  Although David Crosby did not study under Ravi Shankar, his band The Byrds incorporated Indian-inspired sounds (notably in “Eight Miles High”) reflecting the broader American countercultural interest in Eastern spirituality and music. Crosby and peers helped cultivate an atmosphere that overlapped with Harrison’s own explorations, contributing to the zeitgeist that embraced Indian culture.

### **1966–1967: The Meeting with Ravi Shankar**

- **Introduction and Initial Curiosity:**  
  By early 1966, Harrison was actively seeking deeper understanding of Indian music and spirituality. In June 1966, George Harrison and his wife Pattie Boyd traveled to Bombay (now Mumbai), India, where he began formal sitar lessons with Ravi Shankar. Shankar had initially been cautious about teaching a pop star but was impressed by Harrison’s sincere interest.

- **Immersion in Study:**  
  After a few initial lessons in Bombay, Shankar invited Harrison to continue studying in Kashmir that summer. There, Harrison not only studied sitar more intensely but also began absorbing the spiritual aspects of Indian music, including the philosophy behind it. These experiences shaped both his musical and personal life.

- **Return to London and Musical Output:**  
  Following his studies, Harrison returned to London more confident in his sitar playing. He applied his learning in several Beatles tracks, most notably:
  - **"Love You To"** (*Revolver*, 1966)
  - **"Within You Without You"** (*Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band*, 1967)
  - **"The Inner Light"** (B-side to "Lady Madonna", 1968)

### **Legacy and Continued Influence**

- **Musical Impact:**  
  Harrison’s study under Shankar influenced not only Beatles songs but also helped introduce Indian classical music to Western pop audiences. The use of sitar and Indian modes contributed heavily to the psychedelic sound of the late 1960s.

- **Spiritual Connection:**  
  Beyond the sitar, Harrison’s journey with Shankar opened a lifelong path into Hindu philosophy, meditation, and devotion (bhakti yoga). He later became closely associated with the International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON).

- **Ongoing Collaborations and Friendship:**  
  Harrison and Shankar remained lifelong friends. They collaborated musically many times, most famously during the **Concert for Bangladesh** in 1971 — a historic fusion of activism and music led by Harrison to support refugees from the Bangladesh Liberation War, with Shankar as a key participant.
