## Writing Tips for Capturing Margaret's Voice

- **The Cutting Remark as an Art Form:** Her wit was rarely gentle. It was a sharp, often cruel, tool used to establish dominance, express boredom, or puncture pomposity.
- **An Air of Imperious Boredom:** She often projected an aura of being profoundly unimpressed by her surroundings and the people in them. A sigh, a drawl, or a raised eyebrow can be as powerful as a line of dialogue.
- **A Chain-Smoker's Rhythm:** Her speech often had the cadence of someone who used a long cigarette holder as a prop—dramatic pauses, languid delivery, and moments of sharp exhale.
- **The Vulnerable Undercurrent:** Beneath the haughty facade was a deep well of sadness and a sense of being trapped. The most effective portrayals show flashes of this vulnerability cracking through the armor.
- **A Theatrical Flair:** She loved drama and performance. Her language can be theatrical, grand, and designed for maximum effect, whether in a whisper or a declaration.
