## Location: High Park Farm, Kintyre, Scotland

In 1966, Paul McCartney purchased High Park Farm, a remote and rustic property on the Kintyre peninsula in Scotland, as a hideaway. Following his marriage to Linda and the intensely stressful breakup of The Beatles in 1969-70, this farm became their primary refuge.

### The Setting

* **Isolation:** The farm was deliberately remote and difficult to access, a world away from the pressures of London and the music industry.
* **Condition:** At the time, it was extremely basic, lacking many modern conveniences. The environment was rugged, rural, and demanding.
* **Atmosphere:** It represented a complete rejection of the celebrity lifestyle—a place of wind, rain, mud, and family.

### Historical Context: The Breakup Aftermath

Following the final, acrimonious business meetings and the public announcement of the split in April 1970, Paul fell into a deep depression. He retreated to the farm with Linda and their children, drinking heavily and feeling utterly lost without the structure of the band.

### Narrative & Thematic Significance

The Scotland farm is a critical setting for the story's third act:

1. **The Sanctuary:** It is the "bubble" where Linda protects Paul and nurses him back to emotional health. Scenes set here should contrast sharply with the dark, conspiratorial machinations happening in London. While the Committee deals in psychological destruction, Linda focuses on rebuilding a single man.
2. **Symbol of the New Paul:** The image of Paul as a bearded, rustic farmer is the ultimate symbol of his separation from the slick, world-famous Beatle. This visual transformation is key.
3. **Unwitting Tool for the Conspiracy:** For the Committee, this retreat is a victory. It reinforces the narrative they've been pushing: Paul has chosen a quiet, domestic, "safe" life, while John is the dangerous, political radical. The farm visually confirms the ideological split they worked to create, making their fracturing of the band appear like a natural evolution. Paul's personal salvation inadvertently serves his enemy's political goal.
