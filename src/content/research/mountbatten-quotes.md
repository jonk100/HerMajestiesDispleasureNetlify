## Writing Tips for Capturing Mountbatten's Voice

- **Grandiloquent and Self-Assured:** He spoke with the unshakable confidence of a man who believed he was at the center of history. His pronouncements are often sweeping and definitive.
- **A Master Storyteller:** He framed every event as a dramatic narrative in which he played the heroic, decisive role. He was the star of his own epic.
- **Name-Dropping as a Second Language:** He constantly and casually mentioned his connections to kings, queens, prime ministers, and generals to reinforce his own importance.
- **Naval and Aristocratic Terminology:** His speech was peppered with nautical metaphors ("rudder," "ship") and the casual authority of the British aristocracy ("my dear boy").
- **Charm as a Weapon:** His voice is often incredibly charming, persuasive, and engaging. This charm was a tool he used expertly to disarm opponents and get his way.
- **Underlying Ruthlessness:** Beneath the polished charm was a cold, pragmatic, and utterly ruthless operator. His advice and actions were almost always calculated to advance his own or his family's position.
