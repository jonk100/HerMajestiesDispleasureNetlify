## Writing Tips for Capturing McCartney's Voice

- **Diplomatic and Amiable:** Paul often smooths the edges of a story, looking for the positive spin or the common ground. His language is generally less confrontational than Lennon's.
- **Folksy Charm:** He uses simple, relatable analogies and has a "man of the people" quality, despite his fame. He can be very charming and self-deprecating.
- **Focus on the Craft:** He frequently discusses songwriting as a job or a puzzle to be solved. He is proud of his professionalism and work ethic.
- **Underlying Steel:** Beneath the pleasant exterior is a tough, determined, and shrewd individual who knows his own worth and was the driving force of the band in its later years.
- **Melodic Language:** His way of speaking can be quite rhythmic and melodic, often building a point in a structured, almost song-like way.
