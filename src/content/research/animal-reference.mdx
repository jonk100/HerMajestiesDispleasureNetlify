## **Introduction**

This document serves as a quick reference for the various animal species mentioned in research concerning Prince Philip's hunting activities.

### **Pheasant**

* **Habitat:** Native to Asia but introduced worldwide as a game bird. Thrives in woodland edges, scrubland, and agricultural areas.
* **Interesting Facts:** The male (cock) is brightly colored with a long tail, while the female (hen) is mottled brown for camouflage. They are poor flyers, preferring to run, but can burst into short, fast flight when startled.
* **Conservation Status (IUCN):** Least Concern. Their populations are heavily managed and supplemented by breeding programs for sport shooting.

### **Partridge**

* **Habitat:** Ground-dwelling birds found across Europe, Asia, and Africa. Prefers grasslands, farmland, and open scrub. The Grey Partridge is a common UK species.
* **Interesting Facts:** Partridges form a social group called a "covey." They are known for their explosive, whirring flight when flushed from cover.
* **Conservation Status (IUCN):** The Grey Partridge is listed as Near Threatened in some regions due to agricultural intensification, but the overall species group is generally Least Concern.

### **Red Grouse**

* **Habitat:** A subspecies of the Willow Ptarmigan, found exclusively in the upland heather moorlands of Great Britain and Ireland.
* **Interesting Facts:** Its diet consists almost entirely of the shoots, seeds, and flowers of heather. Its population numbers can fluctuate dramatically in natural cycles.
* **Conservation Status (IUCN):** Listed as a species of conservation concern in the UK (Amber List) due to habitat loss and population declines.

### **Red Deer**

* **Habitat:** Native across most of Europe, parts of Asia, and North Africa. Inhabits woodland, moorland, and mountains.
* **Interesting Facts:** It is one of the largest deer species. The male is called a "stag" and grows large, branching antlers which are shed each year. The "rut" is their dramatic autumn mating season, known for the stags' loud roaring.
* **Conservation Status (IUCN):** Least Concern.

### **Wild Boar**

* **Habitat:** Native to much of Eurasia and North Africa. Highly adaptable, living in woodlands, reed beds, and farmland.
* **Interesting Facts:** They are the wild ancestor of the domestic pig. They are omnivorous and use their powerful snouts for rooting in the soil for food. They can be aggressive if threatened.
* **Conservation Status (IUCN):** Least Concern.

### **Tiger**

* **Habitat:** Found in fragmented populations across Asia, from India to Siberia. Inhabits forests, grasslands, and mangrove swamps.
* **Interesting Facts:** The tiger is the largest cat species in the world. Each tiger has a unique stripe pattern, similar to a human fingerprint.
* **Conservation Status (IUCN):** Endangered. Its population has been decimated by poaching and habitat loss.

### **Crocodile**

* **Habitat:** The Nile Crocodile, likely the species hunted in The Gambia, is found throughout freshwater habitats in sub-Saharan Africa.
* **Interesting Facts:** They are apex "ambush predators," waiting for hours or days for suitable prey to come near. They have one of the most powerful bites in the animal kingdom.
* **Conservation Status (IUCN):** Least Concern. Once threatened, conservation efforts have been very successful.

### **Marco Polo Sheep**

* **Habitat:** A subspecies of the Argali sheep, native to the high-altitude Pamir Mountains of Central Asia.
* **Interesting Facts:** Named after Marco Polo, who described them in his travels. They are famous for having the longest horns of any sheep species, with a mature ram's horns sometimes spanning over 6 feet.
* **Conservation Status (IUCN):** Near Threatened, due to poaching and competition with domestic livestock.

### **Quail**

* **Habitat:** Small, migratory game birds. The Common Quail is found across Europe, Asia, and Africa, favoring farmland and grassland.
* **Interesting Facts:** They are notoriously difficult to see, preferring to creep through vegetation. Their call, often described as a "wet-my-lips" sound, is more frequently heard than the bird is seen.
* **Conservation Status (IUCN):** Least Concern.

### **Wild Duck**

* **Habitat:** This broad category often refers to the Mallard, the most common and widespread duck in the Northern Hemisphere. Found in any wetland habitat.
* **Interesting Facts:** The male Mallard has a distinctive iridescent green head. They are "dabbling ducks," feeding by tipping their bodies forward into the water rather than diving completely.
* **Conservation Status (IUCN):** Least Concern.

### **Snipe**

* **Habitat:** Wading birds with very long, slender bills. The Common Snipe is found in marshes, bogs, and wet meadows across the Northern Hemisphere.
* **Interesting Facts:** They are famous for their "winnowing" or "drumming" display flight. During this display, the male dives through the air, and the vibration of his outer tail feathers creates a unique, haunting sound.
* **Conservation Status (IUCN):** Least Concern.

### **Pigeon**

* **Habitat:** The primary quarry for sport is the Wood Pigeon, found in woodland, parks, and farmland across Europe. The Feral Pigeon (or Rock Dove) is found in urban areas worldwide.
* **Interesting Facts:** Wood Pigeons are larger than feral pigeons and are known for their cooing call and the white patches on their neck and wings. They can be significant agricultural pests.
* **Conservation Status (IUCN):** Least Concern.

### **Rabbit**

* **Habitat:** The European Rabbit is native to the Iberian Peninsula but introduced globally. Prefers dry grassland and scrub, living in complex burrow systems called warrens.
* **Interesting Facts:** Known for an extremely high reproductive rate. They are a keystone species in their native habitat but a destructive invasive pest elsewhere (e.g., Australia).
* **Conservation Status (IUCN):** Endangered in its native range (Spain and Portugal) but Least Concern globally.

### **Puffin**

* **Habitat:** The Atlantic Puffin is a seabird that spends most of its life at sea, breeding in large colonies on coastal cliffs and islands in the North Atlantic.
* **Interesting Facts:** Nicknamed "sea parrots" for their brightly colored beaks in the breeding season. They can carry multiple small fish back to their chicks by holding them crosswise in their bill.
* **Conservation Status (IUCN):** Vulnerable, due to threats including overfishing of their food sources.

### **Woodcock**

* **Habitat:** A wading bird found in damp woodlands across Europe and Asia. They are largely nocturnal or crepuscular (active at dawn and dusk).
* **Interesting Facts:** They have exceptional 360-degree vision due to the placement of their eyes high on the sides of their heads. Their camouflage is among the most effective of any bird.
* **Conservation Status (IUCN):** Least Concern.

### **Roe Deer**

* **Habitat:** Native to Europe and Asia, this small deer is highly adaptable, living in woodland, farmland, and even suburban gardens. A male is a "roebuck."
* **Interesting Facts:** Unlike most deer, they are generally solitary or live in small family groups. They are known for their loud, dog-like barking call when alarmed.
* **Conservation Status (IUCN):** Least Concern.

### **Spanish Ibex**

* **Habitat:** A species of wild goat endemic to the mountainous regions of the Iberian Peninsula (Spain and Portugal).
* **Interesting Facts:** Known for their large, ridged, backward-curving horns. They are incredibly agile climbers. Two subspecies have gone extinct in recent history, but the overall population has recovered well.
* **Conservation Status (IUCN):** Least Concern, following successful conservation efforts.
