## **Harold & Louise Harrison** (Parents)

### Their Role in Harrison's Life

* His father, Harold, was a bus conductor and his mother, Louise, was a shop assistant. They provided a stable, supportive, and loving working-class home in Liverpool.
* Unlike John's absent parents or Paul's tragic loss, George's family life was remarkably normal and encouraging.

### Nature of Their Influence

The Harrisons were the **bedrock of normality and encouragement** in George's life. His mother was a passionate music fan who was his earliest and most vocal supporter. His father instilled a quiet work ethic and a sense of doing things properly. This stable foundation gave George the confidence to pursue his passion but also a profound sense of being grounded, which later put him at odds with the surreal excesses of fame.

### Their Relationship with The Beatles & Influence on Harrison's Decisions

* **Relationship:** They were immensely proud and actively involved in the early days. Louise famously wrote back to fan mail and was a constant, cheering presence at early gigs.
* **Influence:** Because he never had to fight for approval at home, George could focus his battles elsewhere: namely, inside the band. His secure upbringing meant he wasn't seeking a replacement family in The Beatles. This gave him the psychological fortitude to eventually demand creative space from the dominant Lennon-McCartney axis and, ultimately, to seek fulfillment outside the group structure entirely.

## **Ravi Shankar** (Guru and Sitar Master)

### Shankar's Role in Harrison's Life

* A world-renowned master of the sitar and Indian classical music.
* He became George's music teacher, spiritual guide, and a lifelong friend after they met in 1966.

### Nature of Shankar's Influence

Ravi Shankar was the **architect of George's spiritual and adult identity**. He did more than teach George an instrument; he introduced him to a profound philosophy, a rich culture, and a spiritual worldview that offered a meaningful alternative to the empty materialism of Western stardom. Shankar provided the "answer" George had been searching for, giving him a purpose beyond being a Beatle.

### Shankar's Relationship with The Beatles & Influence on Harrison's Decisions

* **Relationship:** While respected by the others, Shankar's connection was intensely personal to George. His influence fundamentally changed the band's sound.
* **Influence:** This relationship was the single most important factor in George's artistic divergence. It led directly to him introducing the sitar on "Norwegian Wood" and composing the fully Indian-classical "Within You Without You" for *Sgt. Pepper*. This new spiritual path gave him the confidence to see his own songs as equally valid to John's and Paul's, and the courage to pursue projects they had no interest in, like the landmark Concert for Bangladesh, which he organized at Shankar's behest.

## **Eric Clapton** (The Peer)

### Clapton's Role in Harrison's Life

* A fellow rock guitarist, widely regarded in the mid-60s as a "God" of the instrument.
* He became one of George's closest friends, a musical collaborator, and for a time, a romantic rival for the affections of Pattie Boyd.

### Nature of Clapton's Influence

Clapton was the **source of external musical validation**. In a band where he was often overshadowed and his guitar parts dictated by Paul, George saw Clapton as a respected peer. Clapton's reverence for the blues and his identity as a pure musician—not just a pop star—represented an artistic authenticity that George craved. Their friendship was a partnership of equals.

### Clapton's Relationship with The Beatles & Influence on Harrison's Decisions

* **Relationship:** Clapton was a trusted friend who was famously invited into the band's "inner sanctum."
* **Influence:** Inviting Clapton to play the guitar solo on "While My Guitar Gently Weeps" was an unprecedented act of assertion by George. It broke the band's unwritten rule of no outside musicians on their records and was a power move to force John and Paul to take his songwriting seriously. It worked. This moment was a crucial step in George's journey toward self-confidence and a clear signal that he was willing to look outside The Beatles for artistic fulfillment.

## **Derek Taylor** (The Confidant)

### Taylor's Role in Harrison's Life

* The Beatles' sharp, witty, and deeply trusted press officer during two stints in the 1960s.
* He was an intellectual and a fellow traveler on the path of spiritual discovery, becoming a particularly close friend and ally to George.

### Nature of Taylor's Influence

Derek Taylor was the **sympathetic ear within the machine**. While others in the Beatles' circle were focused on business or music, Taylor was a writer and thinker who understood and shared George's burgeoning interest in spirituality and his disillusionment with fame. He offered intellectual and moral support, acting as a sounding board for ideas that the others might dismiss.

### Taylor's Relationship with The Beatles & Influence on Harrison's Decisions

* **Relationship:** As the head of Apple Corps' press office, he was a key insider who was uniquely loyal to all four Beatles, but he formed a special bond with George.
* **Influence:** Taylor's encouragement was vital. He helped George articulate his new worldview and championed his songs within the organization. When George felt most isolated and creatively stifled, having a trusted, high-level ally like Taylor bolstered his resolve. This support system was crucial for George to maintain his course, pursue projects like his solo album *Wonderwall Music*, and feel he had a voice and a future beyond the band's confines.
