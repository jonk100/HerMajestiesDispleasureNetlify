## Location: Kenwood, St. George's Hill, Weybridge

Kenwood was the mock-Tudor mansion John bought in 1964, located in a wealthy, private estate in the "stockbroker belt" outside London. It was here that he lived with his first wife, Cynthia, and their son, Julian, during the peak of Beatlemania.

### The Duality of Kenwood

The house represented the central conflict in John's life at the time. It was simultaneously:

1. **A Suburban Prison:** A symbol of the conventional, adult life of marriage and mortgages that he had fallen into. He increasingly saw it as a trap, a manifestation of the "phoney" establishment life.
2. **A Psychedelic Playground:** A place where he could retreat from the world, take LSD, write songs, and fill the house with gadgets, avant-garde art, and a rotating cast of friends.

Cynthia's role was to manage this duality, trying to maintain a stable home for Julian amidst the growing chaos.

### Narrative Significance

For the purposes of the conspiracy narrative, Kenwood is a crucial battleground for John's psyche:

* **The Stage for Unraveling:** It is here that Cynthia witnesses the tangible effects of the mounting pressure on John—his moods, his acid-fueled withdrawal, his growing paranoia. The audience knows this is amplified by Operation Minuet, but Cynthia can only see it as a personal failing or the effect of drugs.
* **Exploitable Weakness:** The Committee would view John's domestic life as a potential anchor holding him back from becoming the radical figure they need him to be. Their manipulations would be designed to make him feel trapped and resentful of the stability Kenwood represents.
* **Site of Betrayal:** Ultimately, Kenwood is the setting where the marriage ends—when Cynthia returns from a trip to find John with Yoko Ono. This moment is the culmination of years of psychological drift, a process secretly accelerated by outside forces. It is the point of no return, where John sheds his old life for a new one, perfectly aligning with the Committee's goals.
