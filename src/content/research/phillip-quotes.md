## Writing Tips for Capturing Philip's Voice

- **Military Brevity and Bluntness:** His speech is often short, direct, and devoid of pleasantries. He was a naval officer, and it shows in his concise, command-like phrasing.
- **Dry, Caustic Wit:** His humor is rarely warm. It's sharp, sarcastic, and often at someone else's expense. It’s a tool to puncture pomposity or awkwardness.
- **Unsentimental Pragmatism:** He approaches topics logically and practically, whether it's the monarchy, conservation, or family. He avoids emotional or sentimental language.
- **The Voice of a Bygone Era:** Many of his most famous "gaffes" are simply expressions of a worldview and vocabulary common for a man of his class and generation but jarring to modern ears.
- **Undercurrent of Restlessness:** There's often a sense of a highly intelligent and energetic man constrained by a purely ceremonial role, which comes out in his more provocative or frustrated remarks.
