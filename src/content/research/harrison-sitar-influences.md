## **George Harrison's Sitar Journey**

### **Phase 1: Initial Encounter and Curiosity (Early 1965)**

* **The Catalyst:** Harrison's first direct exposure to the sitar occurred during the filming of *Help!* in April 1965. A scene filmed in a fictional Indian restaurant featured session musicians playing the instrument. While the music was played for comic effect in the film, the unique, droning sound captivated Harrison.
* **The Acquisition:** Shortly after, Harrison was at a London studio session when a friend mentioned the Indian section of London. Intrigued, he visited a shop called Indiacraft and purchased his first, relatively cheap sitar. At this stage, it was an object of **exotic curiosity**, not a serious musical pursuit. He would toy with it at home, trying to figure out how to make sounds, but without any formal knowledge.

### **Phase 2: The First Experiment and Global Impact (Late 1965)**

* **The Song:** During the recording sessions for the *Rubber Soul* album in October 1965, John Lennon was working on the song "Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown)." The song's contemplative, slightly melancholic mood felt like a fit for a new sound. Harrison suggested using the sitar.
* **The Performance:** Harrison worked out a simple, melodic line that mimicked the song's main melody. It was not played in an authentic Indian classical style; rather, it was used as an **exotic texture**, a new color in the band's sonic palette.
* **The Impact:** The release of "Norwegian Wood" was a watershed moment in pop music. It was the first time a sitar had been featured so prominently on a Western pop record. The effect was immediate and immense, kicking off the "raga rock" trend and cementing the sitar as the definitive sound of psychedelia. For Harrison, its success transformed the instrument from a passing fancy into a serious point of focus.

### **Phase 3: The Meeting of the Master (June 1966)**

* **The Introduction:** Deepening his interest, Harrison was introduced to the world's foremost sitar virtuoso, **Ravi Shankar**, at the home of a mutual friend in London. This meeting was the single most important event in Harrison's journey with the instrument.
* **The Shift in Perspective:** Harrison asked Shankar to teach him. Shankar was initially hesitant, wary of a pop star's fleeting interest. But he sensed a genuine humility and spiritual hunger in Harrison. This meeting shifted Harrison's goal from simply "playing the sitar" to understanding the deep spiritual and philosophical tradition from which the music emerged. The sitar was no longer just an instrument; it became a **discipline and a path to enlightenment**.

### **Phase 4: The Path of the Disciple (Late 1966 – 1968)**

* **Immersion in India:** In September 1966, after the Beatles' final concert, Harrison and his wife Pattie flew to India, where he studied sitar formally under Shankar for six weeks. This demonstrated a profound commitment, removing himself from the chaos of Beatlemania to become an anonymous, humble student.
* **Artistic Evolution:** His study under Shankar is directly audible in his compositions.
  * **"Love You To" (*Revolver*, 1966):** His first composition to fully embrace Indian classical structure, featuring sitar, tabla, and a tanpura drone. It was a quantum leap from the simple melody of "Norwegian Wood."
  * **"Within You Without You" (*Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band*, 1967):** The apex of his Indian-influenced work. Recorded with Indian musicians and no other Beatles, it is a piece of pure Indian classical music fused with a Western string arrangement. Lyrically, it is a philosophical sermon, demonstrating that the music and the spiritual message were now inextricably linked for him.

### **Phase 5: The Withdrawal and Lasting Legacy (1968 onwards)**

* **The Realization:** By 1968, Harrison began to pull back from being the "sitar guy." He came to a critical realization: mastering the instrument would take a lifetime of dedication that he couldn't give. He felt the popularization he'd started had led to the sitar becoming a cheap gimmick in Western pop, a trend he felt guilty for creating.
* **Returning to His Roots:** He consciously decided to return to his primary instrument, the guitar. He famously said, "I'm a guitarist," re-engaging with rock and roll with a renewed vigor that led to songs like "While My Guitar Gently Weeps."
* **The True Legacy:** While his active period of playing sitar was relatively brief (approx. 3 years), its impact was permanent. The sitar was never the end goal; it was the **catalyst for a profound personal transformation**.
    1. It gave him a unique musical identity within The Beatles.
    2. It introduced him to Ravi Shankar, who became his lifelong friend and guru.
    3. It opened the door to Hindu philosophy and meditation, which became the bedrock of his life.
    4. The relationship with Shankar led directly to the 1971 **Concert for Bangladesh**, Harrison's greatest humanitarian achievement.

In essence, the sitar was the instrument that allowed George Harrison to find his own voice, not just musically, but spiritually, leading him out of the shadow of Lennon-McCartney and into the light of his own identity.
