## Overview

Prince Philip's involvement in hunting, shooting, and fishing was not a casual hobby but a central and defining aspect of his life and character. From his early youth until well into his old age, he pursued blood sports with immense passion and skill around the globe. This lifelong activity ran parallel to his pioneering work in conservation, creating a public paradox that he frequently had to defend.

### A Foundational Upbringing and Lifelong Practice

- Prince Philip was first taught to shoot as a young boy in Germany while staying with his brother-in-law, Berthold, Margrave of Baden, a keen huntsman. (Source: _Young Prince Philip: His Turbulent Early Life_ by Philip Eade).
- Shooting parties, particularly for [pheasant](/research/animal-reference#pheasant) and [partridge](/research/animal-reference#partridge), were a core part of the Royal Family's annual calendar at estates like Sandringham in Norfolk and Balmoral in Scotland. Philip was the organizer and master of these shoots for decades. (Source: Numerous royal biographies and documentaries, including Gyles Brandreth's _Philip: An Intimate Portrait_).
- The scale of shooting at Sandringham was immense. In a 13-year period from 1981 to 1994, it was reported that an estimated 30,000 [pheasants](/research/animal-reference#pheasant) were killed on the estate. Prince Philip himself was estimated to have shot over 10,000 [pheasants](/research/animal-reference#pheasant) personally at Sandringham by the late 1980s. (Source: _The Independent_, reporting on figures compiled by Animal Aid, 1994).
- Even in his final years, his passion remained. In 2011, at the age of 90, he was reportedly seen shooting [pheasants](/research/animal-reference#pheasant) at Sandringham just days after undergoing heart surgery. (Source: _The Telegraph_, December 2011).

### He Hunted a Vast and Global Variety of Game

- **UK Game:** His primary quarry in the United Kingdom included [red grouse](/research/animal-reference#red-grouse), [partridge](/research/animal-reference#partridge), and [pheasants](/research/animal-reference#pheasant) (on shooting estates) and [red deer](/research/animal-reference#red-deer) stags (stalking at Balmoral). (Source: General royal reporting, BBC documentaries).
- **Wild Boar:** He hunted [wild boar](/research/animal-reference#wild-boar) in Germany on numerous occasions throughout his life, continuing the tradition from his youth. (Source: _Philip: An Intimate Portrait_ by Gyles Brandreth).
- **Tiger:** In 1961, during a royal tour of India, Prince Philip shot and killed a large male [tiger](/research/animal-reference#tiger) in Ranthambore National Park while a guest of the Maharajah of Jaipur. The Queen accompanied him and photographed the hunt. (Source: Widely documented in news archives, including the BBC and Associated Press; featured prominently in documentaries like Netflix's _The Crown_).
- **Crocodile:** During a 1957 royal tour of The Gambia, he shot a 12-foot [crocodile](/research/animal-reference#crocodile) from a dugout canoe on the Gambia River. A famous photograph exists of him standing over the kill. (Source: Photo archives of Getty Images, Associated Press).
- **Wild Sheep:** He hunted [Marco Polo sheep](/research/animal-reference#marco-polo-sheep), a species of argali, in the Himalayas. (Source: _Philip and Elizabeth: Portrait of a Royal Marriage_ by Gyles Brandreth).
- **Other Game:** Over his lifetime, his quarry also reportedly included [quail](/research/animal-reference#quail), [wild duck](/research/animal-reference#wild-duck), [snipe](/research/animal-reference#snipe), [puffins](/research/animal-reference#puffin), [rabbits](/research/animal-reference#rabbit), and various other animals across the Commonwealth and beyond.

### His Hunting Created Significant Public Controversy

- **The 1961 India Tiger Hunt:** This incident is the most infamous. It occurred just weeks before Philip was set to become the first president of the World Wildlife Fund's (WWF) UK appeal. The timing was disastrous, creating headlines worldwide and accusations of blatant hypocrisy that would follow him for the rest of his life. (Source: _The Guardian_ and other international news archives from 1961).
- **The WWF Presidency Paradox:** Prince Philip was a co-founder of the WWF in 1961 and served as its international president from 1981 to 1996. He consistently defended his passion for shooting alongside his conservation work.
- **His Justification:** He argued that "culling" was an essential part of conservation to manage populations and prevent starvation. A famous quote summarizes his view: "I think that there is a difference between being a conservationist and an animal lover... you can be a naturalist and a hunter at the same time." He distinguished between the regulated hunting of game species and the illegal poaching of endangered ones. (Source: _The Guardian_, quoting his own writings and interviews, April 2021).
- **Family Disagreements:** It was reported in later years that he clashed with his grandson, Prince William, over conservation issues, particularly William's desire to destroy the royal ivory collection. Philip reportedly "berated" William, arguing the collection had historical value. (Source: _Daily Mail_, reporting on the book _Charles & The Queen_, 2015).

### The Passion Was Deeply Personal and Part of His Identity

- For Prince Philip, hunting was more than a sport; it was a connection to nature, a test of skill, and a way of life he saw as practical and unsentimental. Gyles Brandreth, his biographer and confidant, noted that Philip saw farming and game management as two sides of the same coin: managing livestock for a purpose.
- He saw the "antis" (anti-hunting protestors) as sentimental town-dwellers who did not understand the countryside or the realities of wildlife management. (Source: _Philip: An Intimate Portrait_ by Gyles Brandreth).
- His final public request regarding his funeral arrangements was to be driven to St. George's Chapel in a custom-built Land Rover Defender he had helped design, painted in military "dark bronze green"—a color synonymous with his practical, country-based, and outdoors-focused life.

## Further Incidents and Public Reactions

### The Spanish Ibex Controversy (1964)

- **Details:** In 1964, while on a private trip to Spain as a guest of his cousins, Prince Philip shot a rare [Spanish Ibex](/research/animal-reference#spanish-ibex). At the time, this subspecies of wild goat was protected, and hunting it was strictly controlled.
- **Context:** The World Wildlife Fund (WWF), with Philip as its UK President, was actively campaigning to save the [Spanish Ibex](/research/animal-reference#spanish-ibex) from extinction. His participation in the hunt was seen as a profound betrayal of the organization's mission.
- **Source:** This incident was reported in various international newspapers at the time, including Spanish and British press, and is often cited by biographers and critics.

### Deer Stalking at Balmoral: A Royal Tradition

- **Role as Mentor:** Prince Philip was instrumental in teaching the craft of stalking [red deer](/research/animal-reference#red-deer) to his children, particularly Prince Charles, and later to his grandsons, William and Harry.
- **The Practice:** Stalking is a physically demanding form of hunting that involves tracking a specific stag over many miles of difficult, hilly terrain. Philip, known for his physical fitness, excelled at it and saw it as a key part of the royal family's connection to Scotland.
