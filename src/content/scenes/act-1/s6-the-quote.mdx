t-DISSOLVE TO:

s-INT. PRINCE PHILIP'S PRIVATE STUDY - EVENING

a-A sanctuary of tradition. Deep shadows and perfect order. Leather-bound books line the walls. Polished silver frames reflect soft lamplight.

a-Philip, in an immaculate dark suit, pours a whiskey. The only sound is the clink of the decanter against crystal glass. He switches on a modest black-and-white television. The screen flickers to life. A BBC NEWSCASTER recaps the day.

c-BBC NEWSCASTER (V.O.)
d-...the highlight of today's investiture was undoubtedly the presentation of Members of the Order of the British Empire to the four members of The Beatles...

a-On screen: grainy footage of the press scrum we just witnessed. Philip sips his whiskey, watching with mild interest.

c-BBC NEWSCASTER (V.O.) (CONT'D)
d-However, an off-hand remark by Mr. John Lennon has raised some eyebrows.

a-We see John lean into the microphone. Now we hear him:

c-JOHN (ON TV)
d-I thought you had to drive tanks and win wars and kill people to get these things.

t-CLOSE ON PHILIP:

a-He freezes, whiskey glass halfway to his lips. The public mask of stoicism cracks and splinters, revealing a look of pure, unadulterated fury.

a-For a long moment, utter silence. Then he sets the glass down with a sharp, deliberate CLICK that echoes in the stillness.

c-PRINCE PHILIP
p-(to the screen, quietly)
d-You're not mocking the medal, boy. You're mocking duty. Sacrifice. Order.
p-(pacing, voice hardening)
d-Everything that built this nation... while you learned guitar chords in your...
p-(scowling with disgust)
d-...Liverpool basement.

a-His hand again moves to his naval service ribbons as he picks up the telephone and dials with precise, military movements.

c-PRINCE PHILIP (INTO PHONE)
d-Dickie.
p-(a pause, listening)
d-...mhm
p-(nodding slowly)
d-I'm in the study, let's talk.

a-He hangs up carefully, staring at the television, where John's frozen image smirks at him with an air of cultural superiority.
