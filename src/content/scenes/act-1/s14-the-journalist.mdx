s-INT. LONDON EVENING STANDARD OFFICE - DAY (FEBRUARY 1966)
a-The newsroom buzzes with Fleet Street energy. Typewriters clack. Phones ring. Cigarette smoke hangs in the air.

a-MAUREEN CLEAVE, 32, sharp and professional, sits at her desk reviewing notes.

a-She glances at a discarded fan magazine nearby. The cover reads "PAUL'S FAVORITE FOODS." She rolls her eyes.

a-Her own desk is crowded with Beatles coverage. Reviews of "Rubber Soul," concert reports, and thoughtful essays on cultural impact and artistic evolution. She picks up a copy of "Rubber Soul" and studies the cover.

c-MAUREEN
p-(to herself)
d-From "Love Me Do" to this in three years...

a-She writes on her notepad: "Individual profiles. Who are they becoming?"

a-DEREK TAYLOR, 35, the entertainment editor, approaches with a cup of tea.

c-DEREK
d-Maureen, tell me you have something for next week. The editor thinks we're neglecting the cultural event of the century.

c-MAUREEN
p-(looking up)
d-I've been thinking. Everyone covers them as a group. The phenomenon. The screaming. But not who they are as individuals.

a-She gestures to the album.

c-MAUREEN (CONT'D)
d-This isn't the same band that recorded "Please Please Me." They're becoming artists. Thinkers. John especially. He's reading more. Questioning more.

c-DEREK
p-(skeptical)
d-They're pop stars. What am I missing?

c-MAUREEN
p-(interrupting, passionate)
d-Are they? "In My Life." Indian music. Studio experimentation. These are cultural leaders, not just entertainers.

a-She picks up a slim paperback from her desk. “Why I Am Not a Christian — Bertrand Russell.” Its pages are dog-eared, underlined.

c-MAUREEN (CONT'D)
d-The youth are changing. Churches are empty. Concert halls are full. The Beatles are reflecting that shift and driving it.

c-DEREK
p-(considering)
d-So what are you proposing?

c-MAUREEN
d-Individual profiles. In-depth interviews. Ideas. Influences. Who they're becoming.

a-She spreads out her notes.

c-MAUREEN (CONT'D)
d-Start with John. He's more candid than ever. The intellectual engine of the band. I want him at home, surrounded by his books.

c-DEREK
p-(warming)
d-"The Thinking Beatle"?

c-MAUREEN
d-Exactly. Who he is when he's not performing.

a-Across the newsroom, partially hidden behind a filing cabinet, CLIVE BARROW lurks in disguise as a maintenance worker, toolbox in hand.

a-He scribbles furiously in a notebook.

c-CLIVE
p-(whispering)
d-"Individual profiles"... "intellectual leader"...

a-He writes: "PRESS MOBILIZING. COORDINATED ATTACK IMMINENT."

c-DEREK
d-And you think Lennon will agree?

c-MAUREEN
d-He wants it. He's frustrated with teen-mag questions. He wants to be taken seriously.

c-DEREK
d-All right. Set it up. Do it right.

c-MAUREEN
p-(confident)
d-I will. John Lennon has a lot to say about the state of the world.

a-Clive nearly drops his toolbox.

c-CLIVE
p-(urgent whisper)
d-"State of the world"... subversive agenda confirmed!

a-He hurries off, scattering papers.

c-OFFICE WORKER
d-Oi! Watch it!

c-CLIVE
p-(panicked, fake accent)
d-Sorry, guv. Maintenance business. Urgent maintenance.

a-He flees, leaving behind a screwdriver.

a-Maureen continues, unaware.

c-MAUREEN
d-I'll call Brian Epstein. Something intimate. Weybridge. Somewhere John feels comfortable.

c-DEREK
d-Just remember. He's still one of the most famous people in the world.

c-MAUREEN
p-(smiling)
d-That's what makes it interesting.

t-CUT TO:

s-EXT. LONDON EVENING STANDARD BUILDING - DAY
a-Clive bursts outside and rushes to a payphone.

c-CLIVE
p-(into phone, breathless)
d-Nigel, it's worse than we thought. The press is coordinating psychological profiling.

t-INTERCUT WITH:

s-INT. MI5 OFFICE - DAY
a-NIGEL FINCH sits at his desk, rubbing his temples.

c-NIGEL
p-(weary)
d-Clive, what exactly did you hear?

c-CLIVE
p-(over phone)
d-In-depth interviews. Individual profiles. Lennon's ideas. Influences.

c-NIGEL
p-(sighing)
d-Clive, that sounds like journalism.

c-CLIVE
p-(indignant)
d-This is how it starts!

c-NIGEL
d-Come back to the office. We need to talk.

c-CLIVE
p-(over phone)
d-This interview will expose his true agenda.

a-Nigel hangs up and stares at the phone.

c-NIGEL
p-(to himself)
d-Or it'll be a normal interview with a pop star who reads books.

a-He writes: "Evening Standard profile on LENNON. Monitor closely."
