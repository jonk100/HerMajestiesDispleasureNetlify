s-INT. BUCKINGHAM PALACE - PRIVATE BATHROOM - DAY (OCTOBER 26, 1965)

a-An ornate bathroom with marble fixtures and gilded mirrors. Crystal sconces cast warm light over royal appointments that have witnessed centuries of history.

a-The Beatles - JOHN LENNON (25), PAUL MCCARTNEY (23), GEORGE HARRISON (22), and RINGO STARR (25) - huddle nervously in their formal attire.

a-John checks the door, then produces a joint from his jacket pocket with casual irreverence.

c-JOHN
d-Right then. Last chance to calm the nerves before we meet Her Majesty.

c-PAUL
p-(weary but complicit, quietly)
d-I still think this is mad, John. We're in the Queen's bloody loo!

c-JOHN
p-(lighting the joint...)
d-We are where we are, lads. Best be relaxed. We're about to get medals.

a-George silently observes the ornate surroundings with detached amusement.

c-RINGO
p-(genuinely pleased, grinning)
d-My mum's going to be over the moon about all this.

a-Paul reluctantly accepts the joint when it's passed to him, his diplomatic nature warring with his anxiety.

c-PAUL
p-(taking a nervous drag)
d-This is exactly the sort of thing that'll end up in the papers, isn't it? "Beatles Caught Smoking Cannabis in Royal Bathroom." The headlines write themselves.

c-JOHN
d-Good. Let them print it. Maybe they'll finally understand we're not their trained little monkeys.

c-PAUL
d-We just need to get through this ceremony without incident. Smile, say thank you, don't mention the war... religion... Anything controversial—

c-JOHN
p-(with a working-class skepticism)
d-Or the fact that these are the same medals they give to the boys who go off and do the... actual work for the Crown?

a-A moment of silence. George finally speaks, his voice quiet and philosophical.

c-GEORGE
d-It's all just theatre though, all of it. Look at the ceiling tiles. It's theatre.

a-John stubs out the joint, his natural irreverence intact but focused.

c-JOHN
p-(checking his reflection)
d-Right then. Do I look sufficiently grateful to the Crown?

a-They straighten their formal attire, each processing the moment according to their nature. John opens the door with casual defiance.

c-JOHN (CONT'D)
d-Come on then, lads. Let's go meet the establishment.

a-They file out, leaving behind the faint scent of cannabis and the echoes of their boyish laughter.
