s-INT. BUCKINGHAM PALACE - PRIVATE STUDY - NIGHT

a-Two days later. A decanter of whiskey sits on a silver tray. The air is thick with unspoken tension.

a-PRINCE PHILIP stands by the fireplace, rigid with controlled fury. LORD MOUNTBATTEN sits in a wingback chair, observing. A man who has mastered the control of his emotion.

a-QUEEN ELIZABETH II sits opposite him, hands folded in her lap. A corgi sleeps at her feet. She is a small island of calm in her husband's tempest.

c-PRINCE PHILIP
d-It's a complete mockery. Not just of the honour, but of the entire system. All of us.

a-He turns from the fire.

c-PRINCE PHILIP (CONT'D)
p-(low and intense)
d-I wore that uniform. I served on those ships. I knew men who received these medals — many posthumously — for doing their duty without question or comment. And we give the same honour to a... a popinjay who jokes about "killing people" for it.
p-(gesturing dismissively)
d-And, of course, the press lap it up. They treat him like a philosopher king. This is how it starts. The slow, steady erosion of respect. A complete failure to understand the proper order of things.

a-The Queen rises calmly and moves to a side table, adjusting a silver-framed photograph by a fraction of an inch. A small act of order in the face of chaos.

c-QUEEN ELIZABETH II
p-(quietly, her back to them)
d-The Crown has weathered unruly poets, pamphleteers, and public figures of every stripe. They are dramatic, their time passes, and the institution endures. One imagines the best course of action is simply to ignore it. It will be forgotten in a week.

c-PRINCE PHILIP
d-Will it? Or will it be seen as yet another sign that we have no authority? That we are irrelevant? This is not just a family, it's a firm. And we must protect our interests.

a-He looks to his uncle for support. Mountbatten takes a slow, deliberate sip of his whiskey, allowing the silence to hang.

c-LORD MOUNTBATTEN
d-Her Majesty's caution is, as always, wise. A direct response would be disastrous. It would make them martyrs.
You know, Philip, in my day we fought actual revolutionaries. Communists. Anarchists. People with guns and manifestos. Not... whatever these rapscallions are up to.

a-Philip glares.

c-LORD MOUNTBATTEN (CONT'D)
p-(leaning forward)
d-But you're right. Cultural power is still power. And they're wielding it, whether they know it or not. So yes, we'll handle it. Quietly. Strategically.
p-(smiling faintly)
d-Consider it a training exercise. If we can't outmanoeuvre four musicians from Liverpool, we've no business running an intelligence service.

a-The Queen turns, intrigued by the re-framing.

c-LORD MOUNTBATTEN (CONT'D)
p-(back to his stern, commanding presence)
d-They are creating a new form of nationalism. Not loyalty to a country, but to a culture. To a tribe. It has its own anthems, its own leaders, its own symbols. It operates entirely outside our control. We can't command it, so we must persuade it. Or, failing that, dismantle it.

c-PRINCE PHILIP
d-Dismantle it? We can't have them arrested for irritating us anymore, Dickie.

c-LORD MOUNTBATTEN
d-Of course not. One doesn't use a battleship to sink a canoe. This requires a more... subtle approach. It's psychological. Think of them not as a monolith, but as a structure with existing fissures. We apply quiet, steady pressure to the weakest points, and they fracture from within.

a-He lets the idea hang in the air, his tone both charming and chilling.

c-LORD MOUNTBATTEN (CONT'D)
d-We amplify their natural tensions. We encourage their worst impulses. Lennon's paranoia. McCartney's ambition. Harrison's... spiritual wanderings. One doesn't send a gunboat. One simply ensures the right book on Eastern mysticism finds its way into the right hands at the right time.
p-(a faint, self-satisfied smile)
d-My great gift, as you know, is to accelerate the inevitable.

a-He lets the words hang in the air for a beat before delivering the name with the finality of a war command.

c-LORD MOUNTBATTEN (CONT'D)
d-We shall call it Operation Minuet. A delicate dance, performed in the shadows.

a-Philip's anger begins to cool, replaced by the focused intensity of a commander. He likes this. It's a plan.

c-PRINCE PHILIP
d-Operation Minuet. And who executes this dance?

c-LORD MOUNTBATTEN
d-I have men at the firm. Not my finest, I'll admit, but suitable for this kind of work. They understand the art of the nudge.

a-Philip nods, satisfied. He finally sits down, the immediate crisis replaced with a long-term strategy. He looks to his wife. There is an urgency in his eyes — a plea for her to see the necessity.

a-The Queen is silent for a long moment, stroking her sleeping dog. She meets her husband's gaze, her own unreadable, before looking away toward the dark window.

c-QUEEN ELIZABETH II
d-And one presumes this Operation Minuet has a budget?

a-Mountbatten and Philip exchange a look. Her question, so mundane and practical, is her reluctant, weary consent.
