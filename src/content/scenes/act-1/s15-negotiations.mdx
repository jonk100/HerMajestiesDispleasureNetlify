s-INT. BRIAN EPSTEIN'S OFFICE - DAY (FEBRUARY 1966)
a-A tastefully modern office in central London. Sleek furniture, framed Beatles memorabilia on the walls. The large desk is a model of organized chaos: neat stacks of contracts, a brimming but orderly inbox tray, and a leather-bound calendar filled with appointments.

a-MAUREEN CLEAVE, 32, sits comfortably but alert across from BRIAN EPSTEIN, 31, who reviews a document with subtle intensity.

c-MAUREEN
d-I'm not interested in fluff, Brian. This isn't for a teen mag. I want real access. Thoughtful conversations, not just press quotes.

a-Epstein doesn't look up.

c-EPSTEIN
d-You have invariably shown finer judgement than most, Maureen. John recognises that.

c-MAUREEN
d-It's not just John. I want to do all four of the boys — individually. Where they live. Who they are when the fans aren't watching.

a-He finally meets her gaze.

c-EPSTEIN
d-And what are you hoping to find?

c-MAUREEN
p-(with increasing firmness)
d-Who they're becoming. Not the legend — just the men. It's clear the roles are evolving. Paul's the diplomat. George is searching. Ringo's observing everything. And John... well, he's in flux.

c-EPSTEIN
p-(quietly amused)
d-Flux is one word for it.

c-MAUREEN
d-The Evening Standard wants this series. So do I. But more than that — I think the public's ready to know them as individuals. Not just mop-tops in suits.

a-Epstein rises and moves toward the window. Thoughtful. He lights a cigarette.

c-EPSTEIN
d-You realize what you're asking, Maureen. Privacy is sacred. Especially to John. And George's home is practically a temple now.

c-MAUREEN
d-No photographers. Just me, a recorder, and a notebook. No entourage. No gotcha questions. They know that's not my style.

a-Epstein pauses, staring through her, calculating.

c-EPSTEIN
d-We should consider the terms of engagement. No entourage is acceptable. We'll retain copy approval for factual accuracy, naturally. But the substance — the tone — I don't need surprises right now.

c-MAUREEN
d-You'll have copy approval for factual accuracy. But the substance — their words, their tone, the framing — that stays mine.

a-Epstein takes a long drag on his cigarette. Considering. Cautiously.

c-EPSTEIN
d-You'll begin with John?

c-MAUREEN
d-If he's willing.

c-EPSTEIN
d-He will be. He's been restless. Daring someone to ask real questions. Just...
p-(again, calculating)
d-We must be careful. His honesty can be utterly forthright when his mind is engaged.

c-MAUREEN
d-I'd expect nothing less.

a-Epstein returns to his desk and opens a small leather-bound address book.

c-EPSTEIN
d-I'll schedule it for next week. Kenwood. Weybridge. My office will coordinate with you.

c-MAUREEN
d-Thank you, Brian.

a-She stands to leave. A soft BUZZ from the intercom. Epstein presses a button, lighting a second cigarette from the first.

c-EPSTEIN
p-(into intercom)
d-Yes, Wendy?

c-WENDY (V.O.)
d-Mr. Epstein, the American tour promoters are here for the two o'clock.

c-EPSTEIN (CONT'D)
p-glancing at his watch.
d-Thanks, Wendy. Give me two minutes.

a-He releases the button and turns fully back to Maureen. The outside chaos held at bay.

c-EPSTEIN
d-This isn't about headlines. It's about their respectability. Remember that when he starts talking... consider where those words might travel.

c-MAUREEN
d-I will.

a-As Maureen exits quietly, Brian sighs and watches the door close behind her. 

c-EPSTEIN
p-under his breath
d-Let's hope the world's ready to hear what he has to say.

a-He sighs deeply again and leans back, gazing at the London skyline. Alone now, the control slips. He pulls a bottle of pills from a desk drawer, casually tosses a handful in his mouth, closes his eyes and swallows.
