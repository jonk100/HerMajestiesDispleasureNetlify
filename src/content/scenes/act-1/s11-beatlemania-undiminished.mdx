s-MONTAGE - RUBBER SOUL HITS #1 - DAY (DECEMBER 1965)
a-A rapid-fire sequence showing the album's unprecedented success:

s-— EXT. RECORD STORE - OHIO - DAY:
a-A massive crowd surrounds a small record shop. A TEENAGE GIRL, 16, clutches a copy of "Rubber Soul" to her chest, tears streaming down her face.

c-TEENAGE GIRL
p-(screaming to her friend)
d-They're getting even better! This isn't just pop music anymore - this is art!

a-She holds up the album cover, studying the distorted faces with reverence.

s-— INT. UNIVERSITY DORMITORY - LONDON - DAY:
a-A COLLEGE STUDENT, 20, plays "Norwegian Wood" on a small record player. His ROOMMATE listens intently, both smoking cigarettes and looking deeply contemplative.

c-COLLEGE STUDENT
p-(in awe)
d-This is the future of music, lad. They've gone from "Love Me Do" to... to this, innit?

c-ROOMMATE
d-That sound.. Never heard that sound in a pop record before.

s-— INT. RADIO STATION - LONDON - DAY:
a-A RADIO DJ, 35, sits before his microphone, practically vibrating with excitement. Charts and sales figures are scattered across his desk.

c-RADIO DJ
p-(breathlessly, into microphone)
d-Ladies and gentlemen, we have just received the latest sales figures for "Rubber Soul," and I can barely believe what I'm reading. Number one simultaneously in Britain AND America. The Beatles have done it again, but this time... this time it's different.

a-He holds up the album, studying the cover.

c-RADIO DJ (CONT'D)
d-This isn't the same band that sang "She Loves You." This is something deeper. This album is going to change everything.

s-INTERCUT — INT. BUCKINGHAM PALACE PRIVATE STUDY — DAY:

a-PRINCE PHILIP sits rigidly behind his desk, watching a small black-and-white television. The radio DJ's voice continues over the TV audio. Philip's jaw tightens with each word of praise.

a-On the TV screen: footage of screaming fans, record store crowds, newspaper headlines proclaiming "BEATLES EVOLVE" and "RUBBER SOUL: THE SOUND OF THE FUTURE."

a-Philip reaches for the remote and turns up the volume, his knuckles white.

c-RADIO DJ (V.O.)
p-(continuing from radio)
d-The sophistication of songs like "In My Life" and "Norwegian Wood"... it's as if The Beatles have graduated from entertainers to... to cultural philosophers.

a-Philip's face darkens. He stands abruptly, walks to the window overlooking the palace grounds.

c-PRINCE PHILIP
p-(scoffing coldly to himself)
d-Cultural philosophers.

a-He turns back to the television, where footage shows young people gathered in record shops, discussing the album with the intensity usually reserved for political movements.

c-PRINCE PHILIP (CONT'D)
p-(under his breath)
d-Exactly what I was afraid of.

t-BACK TO MONTAGE:

s-— EXT. RECORD STORE - MANCHESTER - DAY:
a-Another crowd, this one more diverse - teenagers, college students, even some adults. Everyone clutching copies of "Rubber Soul." The energy is different from typical Beatlemania - more thoughtful, more intense.

a-A YOUNG WOMAN, 22, emerges from the store, carefully examining the album liner notes.

c-YOUNG WOMAN
p-(to her boyfriend)
d-"Though I know I'll never lose affection for people and things that went before." These aren't just lyrics, they're... they're Shelley. When did pop stars start writing like Shelley?

s-— INT. COFFEE SHOP - LIVERPOOL - DAY:
a-A group of TEENAGERS, 16-18, huddle around a table, the album spread between them like a sacred text. They're not screaming - they're analyzing.

c-TEENAGER #1
d-The sitar on "Norwegian Wood" - that's Indian classical music. They're bringing Eastern philosophy into Western pop.

c-TEENAGER #2
d-"In My Life" is just... pure. It's recollection, not just a love song. It's about being an adult and still remembering your street, your mates, isn't it? It gives all our stories weight, it does.

t-BACK TO:

s-— INT. BUCKINGHAM PALACE PRIVATE STUDY - CONTINUOUS:
a-Philip watches this footage with growing alarm. The TV now shows a NEWS REPORTER standing outside Abbey Road Studios.

c-NEWS REPORTER (on TV)
d-What we're witnessing isn't just musical evolution - it's cultural revolution. The Beatles have transformed from teen idols into something far more significant: voices of a generation coming of age.

a-Philip snaps off the television. The room falls into heavy silence.

a-He walks to his desk, picks up a framed photograph of himself in naval uniform, stares at it for a long moment.

c-PRINCE PHILIP
p-(quietly, to the photograph)
d-Twenty years of service. Twenty years of duty. And here we are, up against four deadbeats from Liverpool who dare reshape British culture.

a-He sets down the photograph with deliberate control.

c-PRINCE PHILIP (CONT'D)
p-(with growing intensity)
d-This is the front line. This cultural rot. We're not fighting the Russians anymore. We're fighting anarchists with guitars who think a song about a carpet is poetry...

a-He takes a deep, calculated sip of whiskey. His gaze points to nothing in particular.

c-PRINCE PHILIP (CONT'D)
p-(under his breath, coldly)
d-Not on my watch.

t-FINAL MONTAGE SHOT:

s-— EXT. RECORD STORE - LONDON - DAY:
a-The largest crowd yet - hundreds of people queued around the block. The energy is celebratory but also reverent, as if they're participating in something historically significant.

a-PUSH IN on the crowd to reveal, in the background, a familiar MI5 SURVEILLANCE VAN parked across the street.

s-— INT. MI5 SURVEILLANCE VAN - CONTINUOUS:
a-NIGEL FINCH sits behind the wheel, staring through the windshield at the massive crowd. His usual bureaucratic composure is cracking. He looks overwhelmed, almost defeated.

a-He picks up his radio, speaks into it with weary resignation.

c-NIGEL (into radio)
d-Control, this is Surveillance Unit Seven. I'm looking at roughly... three.. four hundred civilians queued for Beatles merchandise. Repeat: three to four hundred.

a-He pauses, watching as more people join the queue.

c-NIGEL (CONT'D)
p-(quietly, to himself, rubbing his temples)
d-And they expect me to conduct a covert operation against this?

a-He looks up helplessly at the crowd - young and old, working class and middle class, all united in their enthusiasm for an album that's clearly more than entertainment.

a-A YOUNG BOY, 12, walks past the van carrying his copy of RUBBER SOUL like a treasure. He's studying the liner notes - the track list, the credits - with the precise, total focus of a young officer studying a battle plan.

a-Nigel watches the boy disappear into the crowd, then looks down at his surveillance notes. Pages and pages of observations about four young men from Liverpool.

c-NIGEL
p-(into radio, with growing doubt)
d-Control... I think we're going to need a bigger bus.

a-The camera slowly pulls back from the van, showing it dwarfed by the massive crowd celebrating The Beatles' artistic evolution.
