s-INT. MI5 BRIEFING ROOM - DAY
a-The room is an exercise in government-mandated misery. Fluorescent lights hum over a scarred wooden table.

a-SIR DEREK FINCHLEY (54), impeccably dressed, sits at the head of the table, a picture of calm authority. Beside him, LORD MOUNTBATTEN's (65) presence lends the drab room an unearned gravity.

a-Across from them sit NIGEL FINCH (48) and CLIVE BARROW (41). Nigel is perfectly still, his hands clasped around a pen, his expression neutral. Clive fidgets, buzzing with an energy the room cannot contain, his eyes darting between the two powerful men.

c-SIR DEREK
d-Gentlemen. Thank you for coming. We have a matter of some national sensitivity. A delicate but vital undertaking that requires the utmost discretion.

a-He pulls a thin folder from his very fancy, oversized briefcase and slides it across the table. It is labeled "OPERATION MINUET".

c-SIR DEREK (CONT'D)
d-This initiative concerns a unique cultural asset. One that has... begun to operate outside of its preferred parameters.

a-Mountbatten cuts in, his voice like iron.

c-LORD MOUNTBATTEN
d-To be precise, it's become a cultural threat. Their influence is organic and it's spreading... It's infectious - cancerous. It can't be commanded, and must be managed with nuance.

a-Clive leans forward, his eyes wide with excitement. He opens the folder and his face lights up.

c-CLIVE
d-The Beatles. Of course. A classic case of aesthetic subversion! Their semiotic framework is... it's pure psychological warfare wrapped in a three-minute pop song! We must eradicate this disease!

a-Nigel slowly closes his eyes for a single, weary beat. Two fingers land on each temple as he opens his eyes and looks at Sir Derek.

c-NIGEL
d-And the objective, sir? What, precisely, are we to... achieve?

c-SIR DEREK
d-An excellent question, Nigel. The objective is not elimination, but realignment. We encourage the existing entropic forces within the group dynamic. We help them fall apart. Lord Mountbatten has devised a multi-pronged approach.

a-Mountbatten points a finger at Clive.

c-LORD MOUNTBATTEN
d-Barrow. You'll take the primary asset. Lennon. The file suggests he is prone to paranoia, intellectual vanity, and grandiosity. Your job is to amplify those traits. Feed his ego. Make him believe he is a revolutionary, not a pop star. He must become the public threat we already perceive him to be.

c-CLIVE
p-(breathless)
d-A... cognitive infiltration. Sir, I've spent significant time developing a methodology, perfect for this. I call it 'The Klaus Technique'. I pose as a German art critic... discuss the Situationalists... Guy Debroad, perhaps. I gain his trust through aesthetic symbiosis... It's truly revolutionary.

a-Nigel makes a small, almost inaudible sigh. Mountbatten ignores Clive's outburst and turns to Nigel.

c-LORD MOUNTBATTEN
d-Finch. You will take the other two. McCartney and Harrison. McCartney fancies himself a diplomat, a traditionalist. We will flatter that. Make him feel the establishment values him more. Create an ideological wedge. As for Harrison... the file is thin. He seems interested in... sitars.

c-NIGEL
d-... Sitars, sir?

c-LORD MOUNTBATTEN
d-Indeed. Some sort of guitar-harp hybrid as I understand it. Nurture that. A man focused on finding the perfect drone is a man less focused on the team. It's a simple pressure point.

a-Nigel does his best to get something down in his notebook, but after crossing out several misspellings of sitar, just ends up with: "ENCOURAGE SITAR STUDIES?"

c-NIGEL
d-And the drummer, sir? Starr?

a-Mountbatten waves a dismissive hand.

c-LORD MOUNTBATTEN
d-The drummer is psychologically inert. A control group. Ignore him.

a-Sir Derek closes his own (entirely empty now) portfolio with a soft click.

c-SIR DEREK
d-Excellent. I'm confident your considerable expertise will guide you toward the most... appropriate resolutions. Keep me apprised of your progress. Through the appropriate channels, of course. Gentlemen.

a-He and Mountbatten stand and leave. They don't look back.

a-Nigel and Clive are left alone in the humming silence of the room. Clive is practically vibrating with joy, already lost in his delusions of grandeur.

a-Nigel stares down at the words he's just written, tapping is pen against his shoulder with a look of utter confusion on his face: "encourage sitar studies?"

a-He slowly, precisely, underlines the phrase twice.
