s-INT. THE ASHER FAMILY HOME (WIMPOLE STREET) - ATTIC ROOM - DAY (JANUARY 1966)
a-A cramped but vibrant room under a slanted ceiling. This is Paul's creative cocoon. It's dominated by a small upright piano, littered with handwritten lead sheets. Guitars stand in the corner. Stacks of vinyl--Motown, Luciano Berio, American blues--sit next to a copy of a Harold Pinter play.

a-A framed photo of a smiling JANE ASHER sits on the piano.

a-PAUL MCCARTNEY (23), dressed in a sharp knit sweater, sits at the piano, pencil tucked behind his ear. He's deep in thought, playing a simple, melancholic melody--the theme for "The Family Way."

a-He stops. His fingers idly drift into the iconic opening chords of "Yesterday," a moment of muscle memory. He catches himself, a small, private smile on his face -- that was then. He shakes his head slightly, getting back to the task at hand. He picks up the pencil and makes a crisp notation on the score. He's a craftsman at work.

t-DISSOLVE TO:

s-INT. EMI STUDIOS, STUDIO ONE - DAY:
a-The vast, hallowed space, normally home to rock and roll, is now filled with a 30-PIECE ORCHESTRA. String, woodwind, and brass sections, all in formal attire. The air is one of hushed, professional reverence.

a-Paul stands beside the CONDUCTOR (60s, distinguished, a George Martin type), looking slightly out of his element but exuding a quiet confidence. He's listening intently, the professional.

c-PAUL
p-(quietly, to the Conductor)
d-It needs to feel hopeful, but with a bit of a northern sadness to it. You know? Like a Sunday afternoon when the rain's just stopped.

a-The Conductor nods, understanding completely. He raises his baton.

c-CONDUCTOR
d-From the top, gentlemen. "Love in the Open Air."

a-The baton falls. The orchestra begins to play Paul's theme. It's lush, romantic, and sophisticated. It sounds like a 'proper' piece of film music. Paul closes his eyes, listening, a small smile playing on his lips. This is different. This is legitimacy.

s-INTERCUT – INT. EMI STUDIOS - CONTROL ROOM - CONTINUOUS:

a-Behind the thick glass, NIGEL FINCH (48) and CLIVE BARROW (41) watch the scene unfold. They are dressed in drab suits, posing as "acoustic consultants" from the BBC.

a-Clive leans forward, scribbling furiously in his notebook, his eyes alight with delusional insight.

c-CLIVE
d-Observe, Nigel. The subject is pivoting. This isn't rebellion; it's infiltration. A strategic move to co-opt the cultural establishment from within.

a-Nigel sighs, a sound of pure, existential weariness. He adjusts his wire-rimmed spectacles.

c-NIGEL
d-He's writing a film score, Clive.

c-CLIVE
p-(ignoring him)
d-Precisely! It's a calculated play for legitimacy. He's courting the very power structure Lennon affects to despise. A classic pincer movement against the band's own internal contradictions. This is... aesthetic co-option.

a-Nigel makes a single, precise note in his own logbook: "Subject P. McCartney composing instrumental music for a film score."

BACK IN THE STUDIO:

a-The orchestra finishes the piece with a final, beautiful chord that hangs in the air. There is a moment of silence, then the musicians lightly tap their bows on their music stands in a sign of professional respect.

a-Paul beams. It's not the screaming of fans; it's the quiet approval of his peers. He gives the orchestra a small, appreciative "thumbs-up."

c-PAUL
p-(to the Conductor)
d-That's the one. Boss.

s-INT. EMI STUDIOS - CONTROL ROOM - CONTINUOUS:
a-Clive watches Paul's thumbs-up, interpreting it with manic intensity.

c-CLIVE
p-(a hushed, triumphant whisper)
d-Did you see that? A clear signal. He's secured the asset. The entire orchestral establishment. He's building his own cultural army.

a-He underlines a sentence in his notebook twice: "SUBJECT A: McCARTNEY - IDEOLOGICAL PIVOT COMPLETE."

a-Nigel slowly closes his logbook. He stares through the glass at Paul, who is now cheerfully chatting with the first violinist. He sees a talented, ambitious young man being influenced by his surroundings. Nothing more, nothing less.

c-NIGEL
p-(to himself, quietly)
d-And we're the ones meant to be protecting the nation. God help us all.

a-The camera pushes in on Paul, who laughs at something the violinist says. He looks happy and confident. He's completely unaware of the absurd take-aways an ambitious agent is making in the next room.
