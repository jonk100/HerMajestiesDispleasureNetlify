s-INT. JOHN'S WEYBRIDGE HOME - LIVING ROOM - DAY (MARCH 4, 1966)
a-The same room seen earlier. Books everywhere. On the cluttered coffee table: notebooks, tea cups, a dog-eared paperback — ALDOUS HUXLEY, “THE DOORS OF PERCEPTION,” and eight small green boxes with winking red lights. JOHN LENNON, 25, pokes one whose light has just died.

c-JOHN
p-(to himself)
d-Another one gone...

a-He settles back into his armchair, a cup of tea balanced precariously. Casual sweater and jeans. Hair longer now, falling across his forehead. Relaxed. At ease.

a-MAUREEN CLEAVE, 32, sits opposite him. Notebook open. Tape recorder on the table between them. Her eyes move along the shelves: poetry, paperbacks, philosophy. COLIN WILSON. “THE OUTSIDER.”

a-The atmosphere is intimate and conversational — two intelligent people thinking aloud.

c-MAUREEN
d-I have to say, John, this isn’t what most people would expect from a pop star’s living room.

c-JOHN
p-smiling slightly
d-What would they expect? Gold records on the walls and a jukebox?

c-MAUREEN
d-Something like that. Instead, I see...

a-She picks up a book.

c-MAUREEN (CONT'D)
d-Hugh Schonfield. THE PASSOVER PLOT. Not exactly typical reading for someone who sings “She Loves You.”

a-John leans forward with excitement.

c-JOHN
p-animated
d-That’s exactly the point, isn’t it? Everyone thinks because we sing pop songs, we must be empty-headed. But why can’t you make music and think at the same time?

a-John reaches for another book, sets it down without ceremony: BERTRAND RUSSELL. “WHY I AM NOT A CHRISTIAN.”

c-JOHN (CONT'D)
d-I read everything I can get my hands on. Philosophy, religion, poetry. The more famous we get, the more I realize how little I actually know about… well, everything.

c-MAUREEN
p-scribbling with a practiced ease
d-And what are you discovering in all this reading?

c-JOHN
p-(thoughtful)
d-That most of what we’re taught to believe is just… stories. Useful stories, maybe, but stories nonetheless.

a-He picks up a slim volume. D.T. SUZUKI. “ZEN BUDDHISM.”

c-JOHN (CONT'D)
d-Take Christianity. I was brought up Church of England, like most people. But then you read about other religions, other ways of thinking, and you realize… it’s all just different attempts to explain the same mysteries.

c-MAUREEN
d-That’s quite a shift from your Liverpool upbringing.

c-JOHN
p-(laughing)
d-My Aunt Mimi would have a fit if she heard me now. But that’s what happens when you start thinking for yourself instead of just accepting what you’re told.

a-Maureen studies her notes, then looks up.

c-MAUREEN
d-You mentioned Christianity specifically. How do you see its role in modern Britain?

c-JOHN
p-settling back
d-Honestly? I think it’s dying. Not the ideas — some of the ideas are brilliant. Love your neighbor, help the poor, all that. But the institution, the organized bit...

a-He shakes his head.

c-JOHN (CONT'D)
d-Look around. How many young people do you know who actually go to church? Who really believe in all the ritual and ceremony?

c-MAUREEN
d-And you think that’s significant?

c-JOHN
p-warming to the subject.
d-I think it’s inevitable. Christianity will go. It will vanish and shrink. I needn’t argue about that; I’m right and I will be proved right.

a-He pauses, takes a sip of tea. Then, still casually—

c-JOHN (CONT'D)
d-We’re more popular than Jesus now. I don’t know which will go first, rock ’n’ roll or Christianity. Jesus was all right, but his disciples were thick and ordinary. It’s them twisting it that ruins it for me.

a-The words hang briefly. No drama. No emphasis. Maureen writes it down like any other observation.

c-MAUREEN
p-(thoughtful)
d-That’s quite a statement.

c-JOHN
p-(shrugging)
d-Is it? Look at the evidence. We fill stadiums with kids who know every word to our songs. When’s the last time you saw that kind of passion in a church?

a-He leans forward, earnest.

c-JOHN (CONT'D)
d-I’m not saying it’s good or bad. I’m just observing what’s happening. The world’s changing. Young people are looking for meaning in different places.

c-MAUREEN
d-And you think pop music is providing that meaning?

c-JOHN
p-(considering)
d-Some of it, maybe. When we sing about love, or confusion, or growing up… maybe that speaks more directly than ancient parables.

a-He picks up RUBBER SOUL.

c-JOHN (CONT'D)
d-We’re trying to say something real here. About memory. Change. Searching for something deeper than entertainment.

c-MAUREEN
d-So you see The Beatles as having a kind of… spiritual influence?

c-JOHN
p-(uncomfortable)
d-God, no. Don’t make us sound like prophets. We’re just four lads from Liverpool who got lucky.

a-He trails, then looks at her.

c-JOHN (CONT'D)
d-But if our music helps people think, or feel less alone, or question things they’ve taken for granted… maybe that’s useful.

s-EXT. JOHN'S WEYBRIDGE HOME - CONTINUOUS
a-An MI5 surveillance van parked down the street. NIGEL FINCH peers through binoculars. CLIVE BARROW scribbles furiously.

c-CLIVE
p-(whispering)
d-Twenty-three minutes straight! This is clearly a propaganda session!

a-Nigel lowers the binoculars, sighs, and looks back at Clive.

c-NIGEL
d-It’s called an interview, Clive.

c-CLIVE
d-The gestures! The leaning forward! Classic ideological indoctrination!

c-NIGEL
p-(deadpan)
d-Or he’s talking.

s-INT. JOHN'S WEYBRIDGE HOME - CONTINUOUS
a-John indicates an open book nearby. JOSEPH CAMPBELL. “THE HERO WITH A THOUSAND FACES.” Marginal notes in pencil.

c-JOHN
d-All religions start the same. Love. Compassion. Then come the rules. The hierarchies.

a-Dismissive wave.

c-JOHN (CONT'D)
d-Politics. Power instead of truth.

c-MAUREEN
d-And young people are rejecting that?

c-JOHN
d-Anything that feels imposed. They want authenticity.

a-He sits, thoughtful.

c-JOHN (CONT'D)
d-Maybe that’s why the music connects. We’re not pretending to have answers. We’re figuring it out in public.

c-MAUREEN
d-How has fame changed your sense of responsibility?

c-JOHN
p-(rueful)
d-It makes it urgent. When millions are listening, you can’t waste it.

a-A rare vulnerability.

c-JOHN (CONT'D)
d-Not to preach. Just to be honest.

c-MAUREEN
d-And that’s what this reading is about?

c-JOHN
d-Maybe. Or maybe I’m just trying to understand where the world’s going.

a-He looks out the window.

c-JOHN (CONT'D)
d-The old certainties don’t work anymore.

c-MAUREEN
d-And sometimes people look to you.

c-JOHN
p-(smiling)
d-Scary thought.

a-They laugh. The recorder clicks off.

s-EXT. JOHN'S WEYBRIDGE HOME - CONTINUOUS
a-Maureen walks to her car. The surveillance van idles.

c-CLIVE
d-Interview concluded. Recommend debrief.

c-NIGEL
p-takes the radio.
d-Disregard. Standard interview.

a-He starts the van.

c-NIGEL
d-Sometimes, Clive, a conversation is just a conversation.

a-The van pulls away. The house remains. Quiet. Ordinary. 

a-Through the front window, the living room sits exactly as before. Sunlight falls across a low bookshelf. 

a-Tucked between dense paperbacks: a battered copy of “ALICE’S ADVENTURES IN WONDERLAND”. Spine cracked. Well-loved.
