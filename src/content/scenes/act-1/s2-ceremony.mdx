s-INT. BUCKINGHAM PALACE - INVESTITURE ROOM - DAY (OCTOBER 26, 1965)

a-A room of silent, crushing history. Gold. Crystal. Dead monarchs watch from the walls.

a-QUEEN ELIZABETH II (39) stands on the dais, a portrait of practiced duty.

a-At a respectful distance, PRINCE PHILIP (44) watches — hands clasped behind his back, posture ramrod straight. Beside him, his uncle, LORD MOUNTBATTEN (65), surveys the room with the cool, analytical gaze of a strategist.

a-THE BEATLES — JOHN, PAUL, GEORGE, and RINGO — wait their turn. They look impossibly young in their dark suits, shifting their weight, a nervous energy contained within the room's crushing formality.

a-Paul flashes a quick, charming smile when he catches the Queen's eye. Ringo looks genuinely thrilled to be there. George seems to be studying the architecture with philosophical detachment.

a-John, however, has a subtle, almost imperceptible smirk playing on his lips. A glint of the bathroom's rebellious humor remains in his eyes.

a-Philip's gaze locks onto him. His expression, already stern, tightens.

c-PRINCE PHILIP
p-(a low murmur to Mountbatten)
d-There's a carelessness about that one.

c-LORD MOUNTBATTEN
p-(without taking his eyes off them)
d-They call it authenticity, Philip. It's the source of their influence.

a- Philip's jaw works silently in place of a reply. His hand moves to his naval service ribbons — an unconscious gesture, touching the medals he perceives John to have mocked.

a- One by one, they accept their honors — Paul with a polished, diplomatic bow. George with a quiet, respectful nod. Ringo with a wide, happy grin.

a- Then John steps forward. He gives a nod and takes the medal from the Queen, his eyes darting around the room for a moment, taking in the absurdity of it all.

a- To anyone else, it's nothing. To Philip, it's a fraction too casual — a clear sign of contempt. He looks away, his disapproval hardening into something colder.
