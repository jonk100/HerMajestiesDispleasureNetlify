s-INT. JOHN'S WEYBRIDGE HOME - LIVING ROOM - DAY (JANUARY 1966)

a-A Tudor-style mansion that screams expensive success but whispers spiritual emptiness. The living room is dominated not by luxury furniture, but by books. Stacks and stacks of them—philosophy, religion, Eastern mysticism, poetry—cover every surface like intellectual debris.

a-JOHN LENNON (25) sits cross-legged on the Persian carpet, surrounded by open books. His hair is getting longer, his clothes more casual. He’s deeply absorbed in reading *The Passover Plot* by Hugh J. Schonfield, making notes in the margins with intense concentration.

a-Scattered around him: *The Tibetan Book of the Dead*, works by Aldous Huxley, books on Hinduism and Buddhism, volumes of poetry. This isn’t casual reading—this is a man desperately searching for something.

c-JOHN
p-(reading aloud, to himself)
d-"The historical Jesus was a man, not a god... the Christ of faith is a creation of the early church..."

a-He looks up from the book, staring out the large window at the manicured suburban landscape. His expression is troubled, questioning.

c-JOHN (CONT’D)
p-(quietly)
d-If that’s true... then what exactly have we all been believing?

a-CYNTHIA LENNON (26) enters carrying a tea tray. She’s blonde, pretty, but there’s worry in her eyes as she surveys the chaos of books and her increasingly distant husband.

c-CYNTHIA
d-John? I’ve brought you some tea.

a-John doesn’t look up, already reaching for another book—this one on Eastern philosophy.

c-JOHN
p-(distracted)
d-Mmm. Thanks, love.

a-Cynthia sets the tray down carefully, moving books to make space. She picks up *The Tibetan Book of the Dead*, examining it with concern.

c-CYNTHIA
d-John... you’ve been reading for hours. Julian’s been asking for his daddy.

c-JOHN
p-(still reading)
d-In a minute, Cyn. This is... this is important.

a-He holds up a passage from the philosophy book.

c-JOHN (CONT’D)
p-(excited, finally looking at her)
d-Listen to this—“All conditioned things are impermanent. Work out your salvation with diligence.” Buddha’s last words. Doesn’t that just... doesn’t that change everything?

c-CYNTHIA
p-(gently)
d-I don’t know, love. Does it?

c-JOHN
p-(growing animated)
d-Don’t you see? We’ve been living this... this illusion. Fame, money, screaming fans—it’s all maya. Hindu concept. It means illusion, the veil that covers reality.

a-Cynthia sits on the edge of the sofa, watching her husband with growing concern.

c-CYNTHIA
d-You sound like George with all his Indian music talk.

c-JOHN
p-(defensive)
d-Maybe George is onto something. Maybe we all are. Maybe that’s why the music’s changing, why we can’t just sing “Love Me Do” anymore.

a-He gestures at the books around him.

c-JOHN (CONT’D)
d-There’s got to be more than this, Cyn. More than just... being famous.

c-CYNTHIA
p-(worried)
d-But John... you’re scaring me a bit. All this talk about illusions and... and questioning everything. What about us? What about Julian? Are we illusions too?

a-John looks at her. His intensity softens.

c-JOHN
p-(reaching for her hand)
d-No, love. You’re real. Julian’s real. It’s just... everything else. The whole bloody circus.

a-He picks up a newspaper from the coffee table—headlines about Beatles tours, fan hysteria, commercial success.

c-JOHN (CONT’D)
d-Look at this. “Beatles Conquer America Again.” “Rubber Soul Breaks Records.” It’s like we’re not even people anymore. We’re... products.

c-CYNTHIA
d-Maybe you need to get out more. See people. Instead of just... reading all the time.

c-JOHN
p-(with a bitter laugh)
d-See people? Cyn, I can’t walk down the street without being mobbed. This house is the only place I can think.

a-He stands, walks to the window, staring out at suburban perfection.

c-JOHN (CONT’D)
d-Sometimes I feel like I’m disappearing. Like John Lennon the person is being eaten alive by John Lennon the Beatle.

s-EXT. JOHN'S WEYBRIDGE HOME - CONTINUOUS

a-Across the street, NIGEL FINCH sits in a nondescript sedan, watching the house through binoculars. A notebook rests on his lap.

c-NIGEL
p-(into small tape recorder)
d-Subject continues extensive reading program. Observed titles include works on Eastern religion, alternative Christianity, and...

a-He adjusts the binoculars, squinting at book spines through the window.

c-NIGEL (CONT’D)
d-...what appears to be Buddhist philosophy. Recommend immediate investigation of local bookshops for purchase records.

a-Through the glass, John paces, gesticulating as he talks to Cynthia.

c-NIGEL (CONT’D)
p-(continuing)
d-Subject appears agitated. Possible radicalization in progress. Increased isolation may be accelerating ideological drift.

a-He lowers the binoculars, writes: “Day 47 — Intellectual subversion continues.”

s-INT. JOHN'S WEYBRIDGE HOME - CONTINUOUS

a-John is back on the floor, reading from a book on comparative religion. Cynthia watches uneasily.

c-JOHN
p-(reading aloud)
d-“The kingdom of heaven is within you.” That’s what Jesus actually said. Not in some church. Not through some priest. Within you.

a-He looks up, eyes alight.

c-JOHN (CONT’D)
d-What if organized religion got it all wrong, Cyn? What if the real message got buried under centuries of politics and power?

c-CYNTHIA
p-(quietly)
d-John... you’re starting to sound like you think you know better than the Church of England.

c-JOHN
p-(with conviction)
d-Maybe I do. Maybe we all do, if we just think for ourselves.

a-He picks up *The Passover Plot*.

c-JOHN (CONT’D)
d-Schonfield traces how the Jesus story got changed. Mythologized. The real Jesus was probably just a teacher. Like Buddha. Like anyone who tries to wake people up.

a-Cynthia stands.

c-CYNTHIA
d-I think I’ll go check on Julian.

c-JOHN
p-(oblivious)
d-You know what’s mad? We probably reach more people with our music than Jesus ever did.

a-Cynthia pauses at the doorway.

c-CYNTHIA
p-(quietly)
d-Just be careful, John. Some thoughts are dangerous to think out loud.

a-She exits. John stares at the window.

c-JOHN
p-(to himself)
d-If Christianity is just another myth... then what else are we meant to believe without question?

s-EXT. JOHN'S WEYBRIDGE HOME - CONTINUOUS

a-Nigel lowers his binoculars, satisfied.

c-NIGEL
p-(into recorder)
d-Subject questioning fundamental religious beliefs. Recommend escalation. Potential leverage identified.

a-He starts the engine and drives off.

a-The camera holds on John through the window—brilliant, restless, seeking truth—unaware his spiritual journey is being logged as ammunition.
