purpose: "To show The Beatles in their natural habitat, oblivious to the conspiracy. This creates dramatic irony and establishes the existing hairline fractures in the band that Operation Minuet will exploit."
conflict: "The celebratory mood is subtly undermined by the natural creative tensions within the group: John's artistic restlessness vs. Paul's commercial drive, and George's simmering creative frustration."
emotional_beat: "Triumphant celebration gives way to the first hints of creative friction, a glimpse of the fault lines beneath the surface of their unity."

notes: "This scene is the 'control group' before the experiment begins. The audience should see both their incredible bond and the cracks that make them vulnerable."

s-INT. BRIAN EPSTEIN'S TOWNHOUSE - NIGHT (NOVEMBER 1965)

a-The height of mid-sixties sophistication. A pristine townhouse filled with clinking champagne glasses, low laughter, and the glow of recent triumph.

a-BRIAN EPSTEIN, 31, immaculate and radiant with pride, stands at the center of the room as THE BEATLES enter together.

c-BRIAN
d-Y'alright, lads? To the boys. Members of the Order of the British Empire. I knew you could do it. I always knew. To The Beatles!

a-He raises his glass.

c-ALL
d-To The Beatles!

a-They drink. The mood is electric, loose, familial.

a-RINGO holds his MBE medal up to the light, grinning like a schoolboy.

c-RINGO
d-My mum's going to frame this. Right next to the good plates.

a-Laughter. PAUL is already half a step ahead, energized by the moment.

c-PAUL
d-This is brilliant, Eppy, truly. But things like this - they don't just last unless we keep them moving. I've got a melody - could be the next single. We need to book studio time.

a-JOHN rolls his eyes, amused but alert.

c-JOHN
p-(teasing)
d-Always the next single, he is. We just got medals from the Queen and you're on about another silly love song.

a-PAUL grins, unfazed.

c-PAUL
d-Someone once said, "But The Beatles were anti-materialistic." That's a myth. John and I literally used to sit down and say, "Now, let's write a swimming pool."

a-John laughs — but the laugh fades as he stares into his glass, swirling the champagne.

c-JOHN
d-A swimming pool's one thing. But we can do more. The sounds, the words... they can actually say something. Millions of people are really listening to us - looking to us for inspiration.

a-BRIAN senses the shift, moves to smooth it over.

c-BRIAN
p-(gently)
d-Enjoy the moment, boys. This is a triumph. For all of us.

a-GEORGE, quiet on the edge of the sofa, watches John and Paul. He takes a measured sip of his drink.

c-GEORGE
d-It's all just part of the big machine though, isn't it? Doesn't matter what you feed into it. Same sausages come out the other end. Feels like something's missing.

a-The room stills for a beat.

a-Paul looks slightly stung. John smirks — familiar territory. Brian looks pained.

c-PAUL
d-Go on then, George. It's not like that.

c-BRIAN
d-Let’s not turn tonight into a think-piece, eh? You’ve earned the right to just be happy for five minutes.

a-RINGO jumps in, cheerful, disarming.

c-RINGO
d-Hey, we're all in it. The four of us. Always has been. Best seat in the house, I've got.

a-The tension dissolves. George shrugs, half-conceding, finishes his drink and pours another. John swirls his drink and watches the liquid move for a beat.

c-JOHN
p-(smiling, but distant)
d-Feels like the beginning of something.. bigger..

a-John looks up. His smile grows wider as he raises his glass again.

c-JOHN
d-To Ringo. The only sane one among us. And to the toppermost of the poppermost!

a-They lift their glasses.

c-ALL
d-To the toppermost!

a-They drink, laughing again — the cracks papered over by history, affection, and shared momentum.

a-The camera holds on the four of them: united, victorious, and utterly unaware of the massive, brewing firestorm to come.
