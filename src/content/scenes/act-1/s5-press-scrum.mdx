s-EXT. BUCKINGHAM PALACE - GRAND ENTRANCE - DAY

a-—into a blinding wall of camera flash and shouted questions. A chaotic scrum of REPORTERS pushes forward. The Beatles are momentarily stunned before their public personas take over.

c-REPORTERS
p-(talking over each other)
d-Paul! Over here — What did she say? — How does it feel? — Will you tour again? — Ringo! — Smile!

c-PAUL
p-(charming, diplomatic)
d-We're just very honored..

c-RINGO
p-(grinning)
d-Me mum's going to frame it!

a-Laughter. Flash bulbs. A REPORTER shouts something to John — we see his mouth moving, but we don't hear the question over the chaos. John leans toward a microphone and says something, grinning. Some reporters laugh. Others scribble furiously.

a-We see Paul's smile tighten slightly — he caught it, whatever it was. The chaos continues.
