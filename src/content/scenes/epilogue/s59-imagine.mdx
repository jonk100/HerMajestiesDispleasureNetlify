purpose: "To deliver the final, satirical gut-punch. History is not shaped by grand conspiracies, but by tragic, senseless absurdity."
conflict: "The quiet, separate peaces found by the artists versus the shared, unending purgatory of the bureaucrats."
emotional_beat: "Hopeful montage gives way to a shocking, tragic, and deeply ironic final moment. The ultimate anticlimax."

status: "draft"
notes: "The visual and tonal shift from the warm montage to the cold final scene is everything. The final look between Nigel and Clive must be unreadable but heavy with the weight of their shared, useless secret."

t-MONTAGE

a-The simple, hopeful piano intro of "Imagine" begins to play. The visual style is warm, grainy, organic 16mm footage.

t-EXT. TITTENHURST PARK - DAY (1971)

a-JOHN and YOKO, dressed in white, walk hand-in-hand through a misty garden. John is smiling, genuinely at peace.

t-EXT. PAUL'S FARM, SCOTLAND - DAY (MID-70s)

a-PAUL, bearded and wearing a thick jumper, laughs as he gives his young daughter a piggyback ride through a field of wildflowers. He is a father. A husband. A man far from the chaos.

t-EXT. FRIAR PARK GARDENS - DAY (MID-70s)

a-GEORGE, his hair long, patiently tends to his magnificent garden. He looks up at the sun, a quiet, contemplative smile on his face. He has found his own kind of enlightenment.

t-EXT. FILM SET - DAY (MID-70s)

a-Ringo, in a flamboyant costume, shares a joke with a fellow actor. He throws his head back and laughs, a picture of uncomplicated joy.

a-The piano melody continues, full of hope and possibility...

a-And then, ABRUPTLY, it cuts to:

t-INT. FALKLANDS OFFICE - NIGHT (DECEMBER 8, 1980)

a-The sound of the relentless, howling WIND.

a-The room is exactly the same, but ten years have passed. It is a tomb of perfect, miserable symmetry.

a-An older NIGEL (63) and an older CLIVE (56) sit at their identical desks under the harsh fluorescent glare. They are greyer, heavier. Their movements are slow, worn down by a decade of monotony.

a-The small transistor radio on the filing cabinet crackles.

c-RADIO NEWSCASTER (V.O.)
d-...we are interrupting this program with breaking news. Reports from New York are confirming that John Lennon, the musician and former Beatle, has been shot and killed outside his Manhattan apartment building. Police have a suspect in custody, described as a 'deranged fan'...

a-Nigel slowly stops writing. He looks up from his paperwork. He stares across the small, miserable room at Clive.

a-Clive's face is a blank mask. He betrayed his country, his conscience, and his career for a mission that ended in farce. And now, a random madman has achieved with a single, vulgar act what all the machinery of the state could not.

a-The ultimate, cosmic joke.

a-They just look at each other. Two old men in a forgotten office at the bottom of the world. The only two people on Earth who know the absurd, secret war that was fought and lost for absolutely nothing.

a-The camera holds on their faces as the sound of the wind HOWLS outside.

t-FADE TO BLACK.

a-Over the black screen, a final, stark white title card appears:

a-There is no evidence the British Monarchy or intelligence services had any involvement in the death of John Lennon.

t-FINAL SCENE
