purpose: "The final piece of the mission's failure is locked into place through institutional incompetence and Percy's bureaucratic obsession."
conflict: "Clive's demand for state-of-the-art equipment versus Percy's rigid adherence to protocol and inventory limitations."
emotional_beat: "Darkly comic relief. The grand assassination plot is undermined by the mundane reality of government supply chains."

notes: "The visual style is key. Percy's storeroom is a Wes Anderson-esque temple to obsolete but meticulously organized junk. The comedy comes from Percy's complete lack of interest in the mission's gravity, focusing instead on the paperwork."

t-FADE IN:

s-INT. MI5 Q-BRANCH - DAY (FEBRUARY 1970)

a-A cavernous, chilly storeroom in the bowels of Whitehall. Fluorescent lights hum over perfectly aligned rows of grey metal shelving. The shelves are packed with dusty, obsolete Cold War-era equipment, each item bearing a neatly typed label.

a-PERCY DALTON (61) stands behind a long counter, polishing a deactivated landmine with a soft cloth. He wears his usual brown cardigan and a look of profound, eternal irritation.

a-NIGEL FINCH (53) and CLIVE BARROW (46) approach the counter. Clive is practically vibrating with self-importance. Nigel looks as if he's attending his own funeral.

c-CLIVE
p-(With theatrical importance)
d-Percy. We require a long-range, high-velocity pneumatic delivery system. Silenced. With a custom telescopic sight. For... pest control. Top priority.

a-Percy stops polishing. He looks slowly up from the landmine, over the top of his glasses. The look is one of ancient weariness.

c-PERCY
d-Form 18-G. 'Lethal Ordinance Requisition.' Requires sign-off from the Deputy Director and God himself. And we don't have one. Not since the '62 budget cuts.

c-CLIVE
p-(Aghast)
d-But... Operation Elegy is a matter of utmost national importance!

c-PERCY
p-(Unimpressed)
d-Everything is a matter of utmost national importance until it comes time to sign for the damages. What do you have?

a-Nigel slides a perfectly completed, but clearly insufficient, standard equipment form across the counter. Percy inspects it with suspicion.

c-PERCY (CONT'D)
d-'Special Projects.' Very vague. Very convenient.
p-(He sighs, a sound of pure suffering)
d-Wait here.

a-He disappears into the aisles. After a moment of rummaging, he returns, placing a long, canvas-wrapped object on the counter with a heavy, deliberate THUD.

a-He unwraps it to reveal a beautiful, but ancient, German hunting rifle from the 1930s. The woodwork is magnificent, the metalwork gleaming. It belongs in a museum.

c-PERCY (CONT'D)
d-Anschütz .22 Caliber. Confiscated from a Nazi sympathizer in '41. The sights are a bit foggy and it pulls to the left, but she's a lovely piece.

a-Clive stares at the rifle, his grand artistic vision crumbling into dust.

c-CLIVE
d-We are composing a national elegy, Percy, not... going hunting for grouse!

c-PERCY
p-(Ignoring him, running a loving hand over the rifle stock)
d-Now. The important thing. This is a collector's item. You will clean it with the supplied oil—and only the supplied oil—after every use. You will not expose it to damp. And if you lose a single one of these retaining screws, the cost will be deducted from your travel stipend for the next five years.

a-He hands a small, sealed bag containing two tiny screws to Nigel, who accepts it with the gravity of a man receiving a death sentence.

c-CLIVE
p-(Desperately)
d-This is unacceptable! We need precision! We need modernity!

c-PERCY
p-(Leaning forward, his voice a low hiss)
d-You need to sign here. And here. Initial there. And return it in the original canvas. I will be checking.

a-He pushes a clipboard and a fountain pen towards Nigel.

a-Nigel picks up the pen. He can barely contain his relief. The weapon is a joke. It's beautiful, useless, and perfect. He signs the form with a steady hand.

t-FADE OUT.
