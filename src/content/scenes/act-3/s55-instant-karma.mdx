t-FADE IN:

s-INT. CONCERT HALL - DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT (MARCH 1970)

a-A small, cluttered room, warm and organic. Clothes are strewn over chairs. A half-eaten plate of sandwiches sits on a table.

a-JOHN LENNON (30) paces nervously, tuning his acoustic guitar. He wears simple white clothes, looking vulnerable without the armor of The Beatles.

a-YOKO ONO (37), a picture of serenity in matching white, sits perfectly still, watching him.

c-JOHN
d-It feels strange. Doing this without the others. Like I've forgotten how to stand on my own.

c-YOKO
p-(Softly)
d-You are not on your own. You have me. And you have the song. The rest is just... noise.

a-John stops pacing. He looks at her and manages a small, nervous smile.

t-INT. CONCERT HALL - RAFTERS - CONTINUOUS

a-Framed in a cold, symmetrical wide shot. The darkness is absolute, save for a single, low-wattage work light creating a cage of geometric shadows from the steel beams.

a-CLIVE BARROW (46) lies prone on a dusty catwalk. Beside him, ARTHUR JENKINS (52), the Operative, meticulously tries to secure the antique Anschütz rifle to a railing. Arthur's movements are precise and economical; Clive's are twitchy with excitement.

c-ARTHUR
p-(Quietly, reporting a fact)
d-The bracket's not flush. There's a wobble.

c-CLIVE
p-(Hissing)
d-Compensate! An artist works with his materials, Arthur. Now, have you acquired the mark?

a-Arthur sighs, a tiny, almost inaudible puff of air. He squints through the foggy 1930s telescopic sight.

c-ARTHUR
d-Negative. The optics are clouded. It's like looking through a milk bottle.

a-Clive closes his eyes for a second, a man willing his masterpiece into existence through sheer force of will.

t-INT. CONCERT HALL - LIGHTING BOOTH - CONTINUOUS

a-The sterile, humming heart of the theatre's machinery. Banks of levers and dials are arranged with military precision.

a-NIGEL FINCH (53), dressed as a stagehand, stands at the main lighting board, calmly sipping from a thermos of tea.

a-He gives a slow, deliberate nod to a terrified-looking ASSET (20s) at a smaller, secondary board. The Asset swallows hard and nods back, his hands trembling.

t-INT. CONCERT HALL - STAGE - CONTINUOUS

a-The stage is dark. A single microphone stands in a pool of soft, blue light. The vast, expectant silence of the packed hall is a physical presence.

c-ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
d-Ladies and gentlemen, a man who needs no introduction... John Lennon!

a-A roar from the CROWD.

a-John and Yoko walk out from the wings, hand in hand, looking small on the vast stage. They approach the microphone. John positions his guitar. Yoko stands slightly behind him, a silent, supportive presence.

a-The applause dies down. John leans into the microphone.

c-JOHN
p-(His voice echoing slightly)
d-This is for peace.

a-He begins the gentle, instantly recognizable opening chords of "Instant Karma!"

t-INT. CONCERT HALL - RAFTERS - CONTINUOUS

a-Clive's eyes are wide. This is it. The overture.

c-CLIVE
p-(Into a walkie-talkie)
d-Stand by for the Ono Obfuscation. Phase One is imminent.

t-INT. CONCERT HALL - LIGHTING BOOTH - CONTINUOUS

a-Nigel calmly puts the cap back on his thermos. He looks at the terrified Asset.

c-NIGEL
p-(Quietly)
d-On my mark.

a-The Asset's hand hovers over a large, red lever.

t-INT. CONCERT HALL - STAGE - CONTINUOUS

a-John sings, his voice clear and honest.

c-JOHN
p-(Singing)
d-"Instant Karma's gonna get you... Gonna knock you right on the head..."

t-INT. CONCERT HALL - RAFTERS - CONTINUOUS

c-CLIVE
p-(Hissing into the radio)
d-Execute! Execute the Obfuscation!

t-INT. CONCERT HALL - LIGHTING BOOTH - CONTINUOUS

a-Nigel gives the Asset a single, curt nod.

c-NIGEL
d-Now.

a-The Asset yanks the lever down with all his might.

t-INT. CONCERT HALL - STAGE - CONTINUOUS

a-It is not a single spotlight.

a-It is a biblical flood of pure, white light. EVERY SINGLE STAGE LIGHT—hundreds of them—slams on at maximum intensity.

a-The stage disappears into an overexposed, blinding white void.

a-The CROWD GASPS, shielding their eyes.

a-John stumbles back from the microphone, blinded, his song faltering.

t-INT. CONCERT HALL - RAFTERS - CONTINUOUS

a-The glare reflects off Arthur's scope, blinding him.

c-ARTHUR
d-Christ! Negative visibility! It's a total washout!

a-Clive stares in horror. This is not his subtle, artistic vision. This is a train wreck.

c-CLIVE
p-(Screaming into his radio)
d-What is happening?! The subtlety! Where is the bloody subtlety?!

t-INT. CONCERT HALL - LIGHTING BOOTH - CONTINUOUS

a-Nigel watches the chaos unfold, his face a perfect mask of bureaucratic indifference. He takes another slow sip of tea.

t-INT. CONCERT HALL - STAGE - CONTINUOUS

a-Yoko Ono does not see a technical fault. She sees a canvas.

a-She steps forward into the center of the blinding white void, a tiny silhouette against the glare. She takes the microphone from its stand.

a-And she lets out a single, piercing, primal SCREAM.

a-It's a sound that rips through the hall, a bolt of pure, avant-garde energy. It is not a scream of fear. It is a scream of art.

a-The audience is stunned into absolute silence. A few people in the front, thinking this is part of the show, begin to applaud uncertainly.

t-INT. CONCERT HALL - RAFTERS - CONTINUOUS

a-Yoko's shriek cuts through Arthur's professional composure. He flinches violently. An involuntary, human reaction to an inhuman sound.

a-His finger jerks on the trigger.

a-The antique rifle FIRES with a quiet *PFFT*.

a-The shot goes wild. It misses the stage entirely, zipping through the darkness and hitting the giant "UNICEF: CONCERT FOR PEACE" banner hanging high above.

a-The bullet tears through the fabric. The "C" in "PEACE" rips and flaps down, dangling by a thread.

a-The message now reads: PEA E.

a-Clive stares at the ruined banner. His masterpiece. His elegy. It's a joke. It's a typo.

c-CLIVE
p-(A choked whisper into his radio)
d-The Pigeon has flown the coop... Abort. Abort the composition.

t-INT. CONCERT HALL - STAGE - CONTINUOUS

a-The blinding lights suddenly cut out, plunging the stage back into a single, soft spotlight.

a-John, recovering his composure, steps back to the microphone. He has no idea what just happened. He thinks it was just... rock and roll.

a-He finishes the final chords of the song.

a-The audience, utterly bewildered by the lights, the scream, and the broken banner, erupts into confused but thunderous applause.

a-John and Yoko take a bow, hand in hand, and walk off stage. They are alive. They are oblivious.

t-INT. CONCERT HALL - BACKSTAGE - CONTINUOUS

a-Nigel calmly places his thermos back in his satchel. He gives a final, blank look toward the stage, then turns and walks away, melting into the chaos of the backstage crew.

a-His face is a portrait of profound, soul-crushing relief. He did his job. He followed his orders. And he saved a man's life with too much light.

t-FADE OUT.
