SCENE START

INT. CONCERT HALL - DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT (MARCH 1970)

A small, cluttered room, warm and organic. Clothes are strewn over chairs. A half-eaten plate of sandwiches sits on a table.

JOHN LENNON (30) paces nervously, tuning his acoustic guitar. He wears simple white clothes, looking vulnerable without the armor of The Beatles.

YOKO ONO (37), a picture of serenity in matching white, sits perfectly still, watching him.

  JOHN
  It feels strange. Doing this without the others. Like I've forgotten how to stand on my own.

  YOKO
  (Softly)
  You are not on your own. You have me. And you have the song. The rest is just... noise.

John stops pacing. He looks at her and manages a small, nervous smile.

INT. CONCERT HALL - RAFTERS - CONTINUOUS

Framed in a cold, symmetrical wide shot. The darkness is absolute, save for a single, low-wattage work light creating a cage of geometric shadows from the steel beams.

CLIVE BARROW (46) lies prone on a dusty catwalk. Beside him, ARTHUR JENKINS (52), the Operative, meticulously tries to secure the antique Anschütz rifle to a railing. Arthur’s movements are precise and economical; Clive’s are twitchy with excitement.

  ARTHUR
  (Quietly, reporting a fact)
  The bracket's not flush. There's a wobble.

  CLIVE
  (Hissing)
  Compensate! An artist works with his materials, Arthur. Now, have you acquired the mark?

Arthur sighs, a tiny, almost inaudible puff of air. He squints through the foggy 1930s telescopic sight.

  ARTHUR
  Negative. The optics are clouded. It's like looking through a milk bottle.

Clive closes his eyes for a second, a man willing his masterpiece into existence through sheer force of will.

INT. CONCERT HALL - LIGHTING BOOTH - CONTINUOUS

The sterile, humming heart of the theatre's machinery. Banks of levers and dials are arranged with military precision.

NIGEL FINCH (53), dressed as a stagehand, stands at the main lighting board, calmly sipping from a thermos of tea.

He gives a slow, deliberate nod to a terrified-looking ASSET (20s) at a smaller, secondary board. The Asset swallows hard and nods back, his hands trembling.

INT. CONCERT HALL - STAGE - CONTINUOUS

The stage is dark. A single microphone stands in a pool of soft, blue light. The vast, expectant silence of the packed hall is a physical presence.

  ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
  Ladies and gentlemen, a man who needs no introduction... John Lennon!

A roar from the CROWD.

John and Yoko walk out from the wings, hand in hand, looking small on the vast stage. They approach the microphone. John positions his guitar. Yoko stands slightly behind him, a silent, supportive presence.

The applause dies down. John leans into the microphone.

  JOHN
  (His voice echoing slightly)
  This is for peace.

He begins the gentle, instantly recognizable opening chords of "Instant Karma!"

INT. CONCERT HALL - RAFTERS - CONTINUOUS

Clive's eyes are wide. This is it. The overture.

  CLIVE
  (Into a walkie-talkie)
  Stand by for the Ono Obfuscation. Phase One is imminent.

Arthur struggles to keep the blurry silhouette of John's head in his sights.

  ARTHUR
  Target is mobile. I don't have a clean shot.

  CLIVE
  Patience, Arthur. The art will provide.

INT. CONCERT HALL - LIGHTING BOOTH - CONTINUOUS

Nigel calmly puts the cap back on his thermos. He looks at the terrified Asset.

  NIGEL
  (Quietly)
  On my mark.

The Asset's hand hovers over a large, red lever.

INT. CONCERT HALL - STAGE - CONTINUOUS

John sings, his voice clear and honest.

  JOHN
  (Singing)
  "Instant Karma's gonna get you... Gonna knock you right on the head..."

INT. CONCERT HALL - RAFTERS - CONTINUOUS

  CLIVE
  (Hissing into the radio)
  Execute! Execute the Obfuscation!

INT. CONCERT HALL - LIGHTING BOOTH - CONTINUOUS

Nigel gives the Asset a single, curt nod.

  NIGEL
  Now.

The Asset yanks the lever down with all his might.

INT. CONCERT HALL - STAGE - CONTINUOUS

It is not a single spotlight.

It is a biblical flood of pure, white light. EVERY SINGLE STAGE LIGHT—hundreds of them—slams on at maximum intensity.

The stage disappears into an overexposed, blinding white void.

The CROWD GASPS, shielding their eyes.

John stumbles back from the microphone, blinded, his song faltering.

INT. CONCERT HALL - RAFTERS - CONTINUOUS

The glare reflects off Arthur's scope, blinding him.

  ARTHUR
  Christ! Negative visibility! It's a total washout!

Clive stares in horror. This is not his subtle, artistic vision. This is a train wreck.

  CLIVE
  (Screaming into his radio)
  What is happening?! The subtlety! Where is the bloody subtlety?!

INT. CONCERT HALL - LIGHTING BOOTH - CONTINUOUS

Nigel watches the chaos unfold, his face a perfect mask of bureaucratic indifference. He takes another slow sip of tea.

INT. CONCERT HALL - STAGE - CONTINUOUS

Yoko Ono does not see a technical fault. She sees a canvas.

She steps forward into the center of the blinding white void, a tiny silhouette against the glare. She takes the microphone from its stand.

And she lets out a single, piercing, primal SCREAM.

It's a sound that rips through the hall, a bolt of pure, avant-garde energy. It is not a scream of fear. It is a scream of art.

The audience is stunned into absolute silence. A few people in the front, thinking this is part of the show, begin to applaud uncertainly.

INT. CONCERT HALL - RAFTERS - CONTINUOUS

Yoko's shriek cuts through Arthur's professional composure. He flinches violently. An involuntary, human reaction to an inhuman sound.

His finger jerks on the trigger.

The antique rifle FIRES with a quiet *PFFT*.

The shot goes wild. It misses the stage entirely, zipping through the darkness and hitting the giant "UNICEF: CONCERT FOR PEACE" banner hanging high above.

The bullet tears through the fabric. The "C" in "PEACE" rips and flaps down, dangling by a thread.

The message now reads: PEA E.

Clive stares at the ruined banner. His masterpiece. His elegy. It's a joke. It's a typo.

  CLIVE
  (A choked whisper into his radio)
  The Pigeon has flown the coop... Abort. Abort the composition.

INT. CONCERT HALL - STAGE - CONTINUOUS

The blinding lights suddenly cut out, plunging the stage back into a single, soft spotlight.

John, recovering his composure, steps back to the microphone. He has no idea what just happened. He thinks it was just... rock and roll.

He finishes the final chords of the song.

The audience, utterly bewildered by the lights, the scream, and the broken banner, erupts into confused but thunderous applause.

John and Yoko take a bow, hand in hand, and walk off stage. They are alive. They are oblivious.

INT. CONCERT HALL - BACKSTAGE - CONTINUOUS

Nigel calmly places his thermos back in his satchel. He gives a final, blank look toward the stage, then turns and walks away, melting into the chaos of the backstage crew.

His face is a portrait of profound, soul-crushing relief. He did his job. He followed his orders. And he saved a man's life with too much light.
