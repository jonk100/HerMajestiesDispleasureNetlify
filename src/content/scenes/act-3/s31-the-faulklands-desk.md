INT. FALKLANDS OFFICE - DAY (MAY 1970)

A room of profound, soul-crushing symmetry.

Two identical grey metal desks face each other.

NIGEL FINCH (53) sits at one. CLIVE BARROW (46) sits at the other.

Each man has an identical stack of shipping manifests. Each man is processing them with an identical black fountain pen.

Between them, a single grimy window looks out on a vast, empty, windswept landscape of muted greens and browns under a perpetual grey sky. The only sound is the constant, mournful HOWL of the wind.

Clive is a broken man. His artistic pretensions have been stripped away, leaving only a hollow shell. He stares blankly at the paperwork, his movements slow and mechanical.

Nigel, by contrast, seems almost at peace. He processes his forms with the same quiet, methodical precision he has applied to everything. This is just another desk. This is just another job.

On a filing cabinet, a small, crackly transistor radio plays softly.

  RADIO NEWSCASTER (V.O.)
  ...and in London today, the end of an era. Solicitors for Paul McCartney have confirmed he has filed a lawsuit to formally dissolve The Beatles' partnership. A spokesman for the group cited personal and artistic differences...

Clive stops writing. He slowly places his pen down, perfectly parallel to the edge of his desk. He stares out the window at the desolate landscape. His masterpiece, his five-year opera, has ended with this pathetic, tinny announcement in a forgotten office at the bottom of the world.

  CLIVE
  (To the window, a dead voice)
  It should have been a masterpiece.

Nigel looks up from his work. He shows no triumph, no satisfaction. Only a deep, weary pity for the man opposite him.

He takes a slow sip of his tea, then returns to his paperwork. The scratching of his pen is the only sound, a quiet counterpoint to the relentless wind.

The camera holds on the miserable, perfect symmetry of the room, two men in their bureaucratic tomb, forever bound by a secret war that never officially happened.
