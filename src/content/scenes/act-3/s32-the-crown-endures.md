location: "queens-sitting-room"
time_of_day: "day"
characters:
  - "royalty/queen-elizabeth-ii"
  - "royalty/prince-philip"
purpose: "The thematic resolution. The chaotic artist and the obsessed royal have both been exhausted by the conflict, but the soulless, patient machinery of the state grinds on, unchanged."
conflict: "The Queen's quiet, institutional wisdom versus Philip's defeated, personal rage. The final, unspoken power dynamic of their marriage and their roles."
emotional_beat: "Weary vindication for the Queen, silent humiliation for Philip. The quiet, definitive end to his five-year war."
page_count: 2
status: "draft"
notes: "The dialogue is minimal. The story is told through the Queen's quiet actions and Philip's defeated posture. Her focus on the mundane (the crossword) is her ultimate power play."

INT. QUEEN'S SITTING ROOM - DAY (MAY 1970)

A room of profound, unshakable calm. Sunlight streams through tall windows, illuminating a space of soft colors, floral patterns, and perfectly ordered family photographs.

A corgi sleeps soundly in a basket by the fireplace.

QUEEN ELIZABETH II (44) sits in a comfortable armchair, working on a crossword puzzle from *The Times*. She is the picture of serene focus.

PRINCE PHILIP (49) enters. He looks utterly defeated. The military rigidity is gone, replaced by the weary slump of a man who has lost a long and pointless war.

He stands in the middle of the room, adrift. The Queen does not look up from her puzzle.

  THE QUEEN
  (Quietly, to the paper)
  Seven down. 'A temporary folly'. Nine letters.

She fills in the answer with a small, neat pencil. Philip says nothing. The silence stretches.

Finally, she sets the newspaper aside and looks at him. Her expression is not angry, not triumphant. It is simply weary.

  THE QUEEN (CONT'D)
  Is it over?

  PRINCE PHILIP
  (A hoarse whisper)
  Yes.

  THE QUEEN
  You went too far, Philip. You let your pride cloud your judgment. You forgot the most important rule.

She rises calmly and moves to a side table, adjusting a silver-framed photograph of her father by a fraction of an inch. A small, perfect act of order.

  THE QUEEN (CONT'D)
  The Crown does not hold grudges. It has no time for them. It simply... endures.

She turns back to him. Her gaze is steady, clear, and absolute.

  THE QUEEN (CONT'D)
  They were a pop group. They were always going to burn out. All we ever had to do was wait.

The simple, devastating truth of it hangs in the air between them. His five years of rage, conspiracy, and obsession... all for nothing. All to achieve an outcome that was already inevitable.

She returns to her chair, picks up her crossword, and makes another small, precise entry.

He has been dismissed.

He stands alone in the center of the room, a man who tried to command history and was swept aside by it. He turns and slowly exits, leaving the Queen to her puzzle and the quiet, enduring order of her room.
