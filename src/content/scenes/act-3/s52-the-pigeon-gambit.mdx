t-FADE IN:

s-INT. MI5 SAFE HOUSE - DAY (JANUARY 1970)

a-A room of profound, bureaucratic misery. The color palette is a symphony of desaturated institutional beige and melancholic grey. Fluorescent lights hum with oppressive indifference.

a-The room is framed in a deadpan, symmetrical wide shot.

a-SIR DEREK FINCHLEY (59) sits perfectly poised at the head of a cheap wooden table. He is the picture of calm, corporate authority. His slim leather portfolio sits closed before him.

a-NIGEL FINCH (53) sits to his left, a statue of weary resignation. His teacup and saucer are aligned perfectly with the edge of the table.

a-CLIVE BARROW (46) sits opposite, vibrating with a nervous energy the room cannot contain.

a-The air is thick with the unspoken gravity of their last meeting. Finchley clears his throat, a soft, polite sound that cuts through the silence.

c-SIR DEREK FINCHLEY
d-Gentlemen. I have just come from a meeting at the highest level. A strategic reassessment has been made regarding the subject. Operation Minuet has been... concluded.

a-Clive looks momentarily confused, a schoolboy whose favorite game has been cancelled. Nigel doesn't move. He expected this.

c-SIR DEREK FINCHLEY (CONT'D)
d-While the operation's primary objective—the fracturing of the group—has been achieved, recent actions by the primary subject have created an unforeseen complication. It is now the view that the subject no longer represents a cultural nuisance, but a political one.

a-He slides a single, unsigned sheet of paper from his portfolio and places it in the center of the table.

c-SIR DEREK FINCHLEY (CONT'D)
d-As such, a new directive has been issued. The subject's file is to be closed. His activities are to be brought to a... final conclusion. The matter is to be permanently retired.

a-He delivers the lines in a flat, pleasant monotone, as if reading a quarterly budget report.

a-Nigel's hand trembles slightly. His teacup rattles against the saucer with a sharp, ceramic CLICK.

a-Clive leans forward, his eyes scanning the memo's euphemisms. His face, which had been confused, slowly transforms. A manic, creative glee dawns in his eyes. He looks up, breathless.

c-CLIVE
p-(A hushed, reverent whisper)
d-My God. It's the third act.

a-He leaps from his chair and rushes to a dusty chalkboard on the wall, grabbing a piece of chalk.

c-CLIVE (CONT'D)
p-(Muttering to himself)
d-A permanent resolution... It requires artistry. A performance piece...

a-Nigel stares at Finchley, his face draining of color.

c-NIGEL
d-Sir... I'm not sure I understand the operational parameters.

c-SIR DEREK FINCHLEY
p-(Looking him dead in the eye)
d-I think you do, Nigel.

a-The word hangs in the air. The ugly, unspoken truth. Nigel swallows hard.

c-NIGEL
p-(A whisper)
d-This is assassination.

a-The word sounds vulgar and clumsy in the sterile room.

a-Clive, at the chalkboard, stops sketching. He turns, a wild look in his eye, a piece of chalk held like a conductor's baton.

c-CLIVE
d-Don't be so pedestrian, Nigel! It's not an assassination, it's a... a composition! A public performance that concludes with a private solution! I call it... The Pigeon Gambit!

a-He gestures grandly to the chalkboard, which is now covered in a frantic scrawl of arrows and stick figures.

c-CLIVE (CONT'D)
d-The target, Lennon, is scheduled to perform at a UNICEF charity concert. The irony is sublime! He delivers himself to us. Phase One: our asset in the lighting crew creates an 'Ono Obfuscation'—a single, isolating spotlight on the wife. The crowd is distracted. Phase Two...

a-Nigel stares at him, horrified. He turns back to Finchley, pleading.

c-NIGEL
d-Sir Derek. This is... madness. It's not what we do. We are an intelligence service, not...

c-SIR DEREK FINCHLEY
p-(Interrupting smoothly)
d-We are servants of the Crown, Mr. Finch. And we do what is required.

c-NIGEL
d-But a public concert... the variables are astronomical. An air rifle from the rafters? The wind from the ventilation alone... It's too complex. It's unprofessional.

a-He's latched onto his only possible defense: not morality, but pragmatism.

c-NIGEL (CONT'D)
d-If a job must be done, it must be done simply. A car accident. A faulty gas heater. These are the classics for a reason. They are... tidy.

a-Clive looks personally offended, as if Nigel has just insulted his life's work.

c-CLIVE
d-Tidy? We are composing an elegy, Nigel, not... tidying the garage! It needs psychological resonance! The Palace expects a masterpiece, not a vulgar street crime!

a-Finchley watches the exchange with the detached interest of a scientist observing two different species of insect. He lets the silence hang for a beat, then makes his decision.

c-SIR DEREK FINCHLEY
p-(To Clive)
d-Your methodology is... certainly creative.
p-(To Nigel)
d-And your caution is noted, as always.

a-He stands, straightening his perfectly tailored suit jacket. The briefing is over.

c-SIR DEREK FINCHLEY (CONT'D)
d-I expect a preliminary plan on my desk by Monday.
p-(He looks at Clive, a hint of a smile)
d-Something... memorable.

a-He gives a polite, almost imperceptible nod and exits, closing the door behind him with a soft, final CLICK. He has left no fingerprints.

a-Clive immediately turns back to the chalkboard, a man possessed by his muse, sketching frantically.

a-Nigel sits alone at the table. He stares at his cold cup of tea. He is a man trapped between his duty, his pension, and a conscience he never knew he had. The quiet, bureaucratic melancholy he has carried for years has curdled into pure dread.

t-FADE OUT.
