characters:
  - "royalty/prince-philip"
  - "antagonist/lord-mountbatten"
  - "supporting/sir-derek-finchley"
purpose: "Show Philip's hubris, locking in the flawed plan. The mission is no longer about statecraft but is now driven by the petty, aesthetic whims of a powerful man."
conflict: "Mountbatten's strategic caution versus Philip's emotional choice. The voice of military reason against the desire for personal, theatrical revenge."
emotional_beat: "The chilling moment Philip chooses the most flawed plan precisely because its cruelty appeals to him, sealing the mission's fate."
page_count: 2
status: "draft"
notes: "The visual style should be rigidly symmetrical. Philip's approval of the 'theatrical' plan shows Margaret's influence, even in her absence. The scene's power comes from Philip rejecting sound military advice for personal satisfaction."

t-FADE IN:

s-INT. BUCKINGHAM PALACE PRIVATE STUDY - DAY (FEBRUARY 1970)

a-The room is a mausoleum of masculine tradition. Perfectly ordered, silent, and steeped in the desaturated grey light of a London winter.

a-PRINCE PHILIP (49) stands with military rigidity, examining a large map of the world on the wall. His posture is that of a commander.

a-LORD MOUNTBATTEN (70) is seated, swirling a brandy he has no intention of drinking. He is the patient strategist.

a-SIR DEREK FINCHLEY (59) sits opposite him, bolt upright and deeply uncomfortable. He clutches his slim leather portfolio on his lap like a shield.

c-SIR DEREK FINCHLEY
p-(In his smoothest Whitehall tone)
d-And so, Your Highness, that is the proposed methodology. Codename: 'The Pigeon Gambit'. It leverages the subject's scheduled public performance to provide a... unique operational window.

a-Philip turns from the map. His face is impassive, but his eyes are sharp, analytical.

c-PRINCE PHILIP
d-Theatrical.

a-Mountbatten sighs, a soft, weary sound.

c-LORD MOUNTBATTEN
d-It's convoluted, Philip. It's amateurish. Too many variables. A spotlight. A scream. An antique firearm. One might as well rely on the weather. This isn't strategy; it's a roll of the dice.

c-PRINCE PHILIP
p-(To Finchley)
d-And your man, Barrow, he devised this?

c-SIR DEREK FINCHLEY
d-He was the lead architect on the proposal, yes, sir. He feels it has a certain... psychological resonance.

a-Mountbatten scoffs quietly into his glass.

c-LORD MOUNTBATTEN
d-The objective is neutralization, not grand opera. A simple, professional approach carries far less risk. My great gift is to accelerate the inevitable. This... this invites chaos.

a-Philip walks slowly toward the center of the room. He stops, considering. The entire conspiracy hangs on his decision. Finchley holds his breath.

c-PRINCE PHILIP
d-No.
p-(A beat)
d-I like it.

a-Mountbatten looks up, genuinely surprised. This defies all military and strategic logic.

c-PRINCE PHILIP (CONT'D)
d-Let the little revolutionary be undone by a spectacle. He lives his life as performance art. Let him die by it. There's a certain... symmetry.

a-A small, cruel smile touches Philip's lips. He is no longer the pragmatic guardian of the Crown. He is the author of a revenge plot, savoring the final chapter. He is thinking not like Mountbatten, but like Margaret.

c-LORD MOUNTBATTEN
d-Philip, this is unwise. It is an indulgence.

c-PRINCE PHILIP
p-(His voice like ice)
d-He indulged himself when he sent back my wife's medal with a note about his pop song. The time for prudence is over.

a-He turns to the terrified Finchley.

c-PRINCE PHILIP (CONT'D)
d-Proceed. And ensure there are no loose ends. Your man, Finch, will keep the enthusiast in check?

c-SIR DEREK FINCHLEY
p-(Finding his voice)
d-Mr. Finch is a... stabilizing influence, Your Highness. Yes.

c-PRINCE PHILIP
d-See that he is.

a-Philip turns his back on them, returning to his map. The decision is made. The conversation is over.

a-Sir Derek Finchley gives a stiff, almost imperceptible nod and rises, eager to escape the room's chilling atmosphere.

a-Mountbatten remains seated, staring down into his brandy. He sees his nephew's personal obsession finally eclipse his duty. He has given his advice, it has been rejected, and now he must follow the chain of command, no matter how disastrous the destination.

t-FADE OUT.
