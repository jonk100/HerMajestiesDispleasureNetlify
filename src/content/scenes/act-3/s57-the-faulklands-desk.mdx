s-INT. FALKLANDS OFFICE - DAY (MAY 1970)

a-A room of profound, soul-crushing symmetry.

a-Two identical grey metal desks face each other.

a-NIGEL FINCH (53) sits at one. CLIVE BARROW (46) sits at the other.

a-Each man has an identical stack of shipping manifests. Each man is processing them with an identical black fountain pen.

a-Between them, a single grimy window looks out on a vast, empty, windswept landscape of muted greens and browns under a perpetual grey sky. The only sound is the constant, mournful HOWL of the wind.

a-Clive is a broken man. His artistic pretensions have been stripped away, leaving only a hollow shell. He stares blankly at the paperwork, his movements slow and mechanical.

a-Nigel, by contrast, seems almost at peace. He processes his forms with the same quiet, methodical precision he has applied to everything. This is just another desk. This is just another job.

a-On a filing cabinet, a small, crackly transistor radio plays softly.

c-RADIO NEWSCASTER (V.O.)
d-...and in London today, the end of an era. Solicitors for Paul McCartney have confirmed he has filed a lawsuit to formally dissolve The Beatles' partnership. A spokesman for the group cited personal and artistic differences...

a-Clive stops writing. He slowly places his pen down, perfectly parallel to the edge of his desk. He stares out the window at the desolate landscape. His masterpiece, his five-year opera, has ended with this pathetic, tinny announcement in a forgotten office at the bottom of the world.

c-CLIVE
p-(To the window, a dead voice)
d-It should have been a masterpiece.

a-Nigel looks up from his work. He shows no triumph, no satisfaction. Only a deep, weary pity for the man opposite him.

a-He takes a slow sip of his tea, then returns to his paperwork. The scratching of his pen is the only sound, a quiet counterpoint to the relentless wind.

a-The camera holds on the miserable, perfect symmetry of the room, two men in their bureaucratic tomb, forever bound by a secret war that never officially happened.

t-FADE OUT.
