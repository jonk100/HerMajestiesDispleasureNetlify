characters:
  - "royalty/prince-philip"

  - "supporting/sir-derek-finchley"
purpose: "To satirize the soulless nature of power, where colossal failure results not in justice, but in a quiet, bureaucratic cleanup."
conflict: "Philip's demand for accountability versus Finchley's mastery of plausible deniability and Mountbatten's cold, pragmatic need for damage control."
emotional_beat: "The chilling, almost comedic, efficiency of the establishment protecting itself. The moment the operatives are officially erased."
page_count: 2
status: "draft"
notes: "The visual style is key: a stark, deadpan wide shot. The comedy is brutal and comes from the clash between Philip's rage and the bureaucratic calm of the other two. No one accepts blame."

INT. MI5 DEBRIEFING ROOM - DAY (MARCH 1970)

A sterile, windowless room, even more depressing than the safe house. It is designed for institutional blame-shifting.

Framed in a stark, deadpan wide shot.

PRINCE PHILIP (49) stands ramrod straight, his hands clasped behind his back. He is a study in contained, incandescent fury.

SIR DEREK FINCHLEY (59) sits opposite, a picture of calm, corporate concern. His slim portfolio is closed on the table before him.

LORD MOUNTBATTEN (70) stands slightly apart, examining a framed photograph of the London skyline as if the conversation is a minor inconvenience.

  PRINCE PHILIP
  (His voice dangerously low)
  A lighting fault. And a lucky shot that hit a banner. That is the official explanation for this... monumental incompetence.

  SIR DEREK FINCHLEY
  (Smoothly)
  The after-action report suggests the assets encountered unforeseen on-site variables, Your Highness. The plan, while creatively ambitious, perhaps lacked the requisite flexibility for a fluid operational environment.

Philip turns his head slowly to stare at Finchley.

  PRINCE PHILIP
  Do not use that... management jargon with me, Sir Derek. Your men failed. Spectacularly. I want accountability.

  SIR DEREK FINCHLEY
  And you shall have it, sir. A full internal review is underway. We are confident we can identify the procedural shortfalls that led to this... sub-optimal outcome.

Mountbatten turns from the photograph, his patience finally exhausted.

  LORD MOUNTBATTEN
  The outcome wasn't 'sub-optimal,' Derek. It was a farce. And a conspicuous one.
  (He looks at Philip)
  The mission is compromised beyond recovery. Any further action is impossible. The assets themselves are now a liability.

  PRINCE PHILIP
  They should be court-martialed.

  LORD MOUNTBATTEN
  They are not soldiers, Philip, they are civil servants. And more importantly, they are the only two men outside this room who know the operational parameters. You cannot court-martial a secret.

Mountbatten's tone is cold, clinical. This is no longer a strategic game; it is a cleanup operation.

  LORD MOUNTBATTEN (CONT'D)
  We need to cauterize the wound.

Philip stares at him, the military term landing with brutal clarity. Sir Derek nods slightly, understanding his role perfectly.

  SIR DEREK FINCHLEY
  Of course. There is a precedent for this. A long-term, remote administrative posting. Reassignment to an oversight role where their... unique experience can be contained. The Falklands desk has two sudden vacancies.

  PRINCE PHILIP
  (Scoffs)
  A desk job? After this fiasco?

  LORD MOUNTBATTEN
  It's not a reward, Philip. It's a tomb. They will spend the rest of their careers counting penguins and processing shipping manifests. They will be erased. The operation never happened. The file will be sealed. And we will never speak of it again.

The finality in Mountbatten's voice is absolute.

Philip's jaw works silently. He has been utterly defeated, not by Lennon, but by the sheer, soul-crushing inertia of the bureaucracy he commands. There will be no victory, no justice, only a quiet, administrative burial.

He turns and walks towards the door without another word.

  SIR DEREK FINCHLEY
  (To Mountbatten, quietly)
  I will make the necessary arrangements.

Mountbatten simply nods, his gaze distant. The institution has protected itself. That is the only victory that matters.
