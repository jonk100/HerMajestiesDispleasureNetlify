purpose: "The final piece of the mission's failure is locked into place through institutional incompetence and Percy's bureaucratic obsession."
conflict: "Clive's demand for state-of-the-art equipment versus Percy's rigid adherence to protocol and inventory limitations."
emotional_beat: "Darkly comic relief. The grand assassination plot is undermined by the mundane reality of government supply chains."

status: "draft"
notes: "The visual style is key. Percy's storeroom is a Wes Anderson-esque temple to obsolete but meticulously organized junk. The comedy comes from Percy's complete lack of interest in the mission's gravity, focusing instead on the paperwork."

SCENE START

INT. MI5 Q-BRANCH - DAY (FEBRUARY 1970)

A cavernous, chilly storeroom in the bowels of Whitehall. Fluorescent lights hum over perfectly aligned rows of grey metal shelving. The shelves are packed with dusty, obsolete Cold War-era equipment, each item bearing a neatly typed label.

PERCY DALTON (61) stands behind a long counter, polishing a deactivated landmine with a soft cloth. He wears his usual brown cardigan and a look of profound, eternal irritation.

NIGEL FINCH (53) and CLIVE BARROW (46) approach the counter. Clive is practically vibrating with self-importance. Nigel looks as if he's attending his own funeral.

  CLIVE
  (With theatrical importance)
  Percy. We require a long-range, high-velocity pneumatic delivery system. Silenced. With a custom telescopic sight. For... pest control. Top priority.

Percy stops polishing. He looks slowly up from the landmine, over the top of his glasses. The look is one of ancient weariness.

  PERCY
  Form 18-G. 'Lethal Ordinance Requisition.' Requires sign-off from the Deputy Director and God himself. And we don't have one. Not since the '62 budget cuts.

  CLIVE
  (Aghast)
  But... Operation Elegy is a matter of utmost national importance!

  PERCY
  (Unimpressed)
  Everything is a matter of utmost national importance until it comes time to sign for the damages. What do you have?

Nigel slides a perfectly completed, but clearly insufficient, standard equipment form across the counter. Percy inspects it with suspicion.

  PERCY (CONT'D)
  'Special Projects.' Very vague. Very convenient.
  (He sighs, a sound of pure suffering)
  Wait here.

He disappears into the aisles. After a moment of rummaging, he returns, placing a long, canvas-wrapped object on the counter with a heavy, deliberate THUD.

He unwraps it to reveal a beautiful, but ancient, German hunting rifle from the 1930s. The woodwork is magnificent, the metalwork gleaming. It belongs in a museum.

  PERCY (CONT'D)
  Anschütz .22 Caliber. Confiscated from a Nazi sympathizer in '41. The sights are a bit foggy and it pulls to the left, but she's a lovely piece.

Clive stares at the rifle, his grand artistic vision crumbling into dust.

  CLIVE
  We are composing a national elegy, Percy, not... going hunting for grouse!

  PERCY
  (Ignoring him, running a loving hand over the rifle stock)
  Now. The important thing. This is a collector's item. You will clean it with the supplied oil—and only the supplied oil—after every use. You will not expose it to damp. And if you lose a single one of these retaining screws, the cost will be deducted from your travel stipend for the next five years.

He hands a small, sealed bag containing two tiny screws to Nigel, who accepts it with the gravity of a man receiving a death sentence.

  CLIVE
  (Desperately)
  This is unacceptable! We need precision! We need modernity!

  PERCY
  (Leaning forward, his voice a low hiss)
  You need to sign here. And here. Initial there. And return it in the original canvas. I will be checking.

He pushes a clipboard and a fountain pen towards Nigel.

Nigel picks up the pen. He can barely contain his relief. The weapon is a joke. It's beautiful, useless, and perfect. He signs the form with a steady hand.
