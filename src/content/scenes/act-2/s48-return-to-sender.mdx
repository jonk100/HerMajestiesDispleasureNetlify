purpose: "The Midpoint. John's act of defiance turns the tables. He isn't just a fractured pop star; he's a political dissident using the Crown's own symbol against them."
conflict: "The immense political and personal weight of John's act versus the mundane, indifferent bureaucracy embodied by Brenda."
emotional_beat: "Quiet resolve and the birth of a political artist, rendered absurdly anticlimactic by the setting."

status: "draft"
notes: "Brenda's complete cultural obliviousness is the key to the scene's satirical tone. Her focus on procedure transforms a historic act of rebellion into a mundane transaction."

t-FADE IN:

s-INT. POST OFFICE, LONDON - DAY (NOVEMBER 25, 1969)

a-The echoing hall is the epitome of civil service indifference. Harsh fluorescent lights reflect off the worn linoleum floors. A queue of people shuffles forward with practiced patience.

a-JOHN LENNON (29) and YOKO ONO (36) stand in the queue. Dressed in simple dark coats, they blend in. John clutches a small, plain cardboard box.

a-They reach the counter. Behind the glass partition sits BRENDA (45), a woman who looks as if she were born into her postal worker's uniform. She's been stamping forms since the dawn of time.

c-BRENDA
p-(Without looking up)
d-Next, please.

a-John slides the small box through the opening at the bottom of the glass.

c-JOHN
p-(Quietly)
d-This is for Buckingham Palace.

a-Brenda eyes the box, then John, with no flicker of recognition. It's just another address.

c-BRENDA
d-Contents?

a-John pauses for a beat.

c-JOHN
d-A medal.

a-Brenda makes a bored tick on a form. She's processed stranger things before lunch.

c-BRENDA
d-Right. Needs to go recorded. That'll be one and six.

a-John pays. As Brenda begins the mechanical process of her job—weighing the package, selecting a stamp, consulting a chart—we hear John's voice, calm and resolute.

c-JOHN (V.O.)
d-Your Majesty, I am returning this MBE as a protest against Britain's involvement in the Nigeria-Biafra thing...

a-Brenda licks a stamp with a practiced flick of her tongue and places it precisely on the box.

c-JOHN (V.O.)
d-...against our support of America in Vietnam...

a-She picks up her heavy rubber stamp and brings it down with a loud, final, echoing THUD.

c-JOHN (V.O.)
d-...and against 'Cold Turkey' slipping down the charts. With love, John Lennon of Bag.

a-The transaction is complete. Brenda slides the box off the counter and drops it unceremoniously into a large canvas mail sack beside her.

a-It lands with a dull, anticlimactic THUD.

a-Brenda is already looking past them, her focus on the next person in the queue. Her duty to John Lennon is done.

c-BRENDA
d-Next.

a-John and Yoko turn and walk away, hand in hand. They disappear into the anonymous London crowd.

a-The camera lingers on the mail sack, filled with ordinary parcels. Inside, a symbol of rebellion begins its quiet, bureaucratic journey to the heart of the establishment.

t-FADE OUT.
