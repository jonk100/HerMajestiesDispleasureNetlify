purpose: "The Midpoint. John's act of defiance turns the tables. He isn't just a fractured pop star; he's a political dissident using the Crown's own symbol against them."
conflict: "The immense political and personal weight of John's act versus the mundane, indifferent bureaucracy embodied by Brenda."
emotional_beat: "Quiet resolve and the birth of a political artist, rendered absurdly anticlimactic by the setting."

status: "draft"
notes: "Brenda's complete cultural obliviousness is the key to the scene's satirical tone. Her focus on procedure transforms a historic act of rebellion into a mundane transaction."

SCENE START

INT. POST OFFICE, LONDON - DAY (NOVEMBER 25, 1969)

The echoing hall is the epitome of civil service indifference. Harsh fluorescent lights reflect off the worn linoleum floors. A queue of people shuffles forward with practiced patience.

JOHN LENNON (29) and YOKO ONO (36) stand in the queue. Dressed in simple dark coats, they blend in. John clutches a small, plain cardboard box.

They reach the counter. Behind the glass partition sits BRENDA (45), a woman who looks as if she were born into her postal worker's uniform. She's been stamping forms since the dawn of time.

  BRENDA
  (Without looking up)
  Next, please.

John slides the small box through the opening at the bottom of the glass.

  JOHN
  (Quietly)
  This is for Buckingham Palace.

Brenda eyes the box, then John, with no flicker of recognition. It's just another address.

  BRENDA
  Contents?

John pauses for a beat.

  JOHN
  A medal.

Brenda makes a bored tick on a form. She's processed stranger things before lunch.

  BRENDA
  Right. Needs to go recorded. That'll be one and six.

John pays. As Brenda begins the mechanical process of her job—weighing the package, selecting a stamp, consulting a chart—we hear John's voice, calm and resolute.

  JOHN (V.O.)
  Your Majesty, I am returning this MBE as a protest against Britain's involvement in the Nigeria-Biafra thing...

Brenda licks a stamp with a practiced flick of her tongue and places it precisely on the box.

  JOHN (V.O.)
  ...against our support of America in Vietnam...

She picks up her heavy rubber stamp and brings it down with a loud, final, echoing THUD.

  JOHN (V.O.)
  ...and against 'Cold Turkey' slipping down the charts. With love, John Lennon of Bag.

The transaction is complete. Brenda slides the box off the counter and drops it unceremoniously into a large canvas mail sack beside her.

It lands with a dull, anticlimactic THUD.

Brenda is already looking past them, her focus on the next person in the queue. Her duty to John Lennon is done.

  BRENDA
  Next.

John and Yoko turn and walk away, hand in hand. They disappear into the anonymous London crowd.

The camera lingers on the mail sack, filled with ordinary parcels. Inside, a symbol of rebellion begins its quiet, bureaucratic journey to the heart of the establishment.

FADE OUT.
