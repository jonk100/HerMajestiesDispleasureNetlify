s-INT. BUCKINGHAM PALACE PRIVATE STUDY - DAY (AUGUST 1966)

a-A sanctuary of traditional British power. Dark oak paneling, naval paintings, hunting trophies. Everything speaks to hierarchy and masculine authority.

a-PRINCE PHILIP (45) sits in a leather chair, impeccably dressed in a dark suit. Before him, a small black-and-white television flickers with news footage.

a-ON THE TV SCREEN: Grainy footage of AMERICAN PROTESTERS outside a radio station. Signs read "BEATLES GO HOME" and "LENNON = BLASPHEMER." A BONFIRE burns in the background - vinyl records curling and melting in the flames.

a-An AMERICAN NEWS ANCHOR's voice crackles through the small speaker:

c-TV ANCHOR (V.O.)
d-...religious groups across the Bible Belt continue to organize boycotts following Lennon's controversial remarks comparing The Beatles' popularity to that of Jesus Christ...

a-Philip watches with the focused attention of a general studying battlefield reports. His expression is unreadable, controlled.

a-The footage cuts to a SOUTHERN PREACHER at a pulpit, gesticulating wildly:

c-PREACHER (ON TV)
d-These boys have forgotten that there is only one King of Kings, and His name is not John, Paul, George, or Ringo!

a-The congregation ERUPTS in applause. The camera pans across faces twisted with righteous fury.

a-Philip reaches for a delicate china teacup sitting on a side table. He takes a measured sip, his eyes never leaving the screen.

a-More footage: TEENAGERS throwing Beatles records into flames. A RADIO DJ dramatically snapping a "Rubber Soul" album in half. PROTESTERS marching with crosses.

a-The news anchor continues:

c-TV ANCHOR (V.O.)
d-...several radio stations have banned Beatles music entirely, with some calling for a permanent boycott of all British recording artists...

a-Philip allows himself the smallest of smiles - barely a twitch at the corner of his mouth. He sets down his teacup with the precision of a chess master making a winning move.

c-PHILIP
p-(quietly, to himself)
d-Quite.

a-He reaches for a remote control - a modern intrusion in this traditional space - and switches off the television. The screen fades to black with a soft electronic whine.

a-Philip sits back in his chair, steepling his fingers. Through the tall windows behind him, we can see the palace gardens in the afternoon light - serene, ordered, eternal.

a-The silence in the room is profound. Philip's satisfaction is complete, but controlled. This is not celebration - this is confirmation that the natural order of things is being restored.

a-He picks up his teacup again and takes another sip, his eyes focused on some distant point beyond the windows. The weight of institutional power settles around him like a comfortable coat.
