SCENE START

John Meets Yoko

FADE IN:

INT. INDICA GALLERY - NIGHT (NOVEMBER 9, 1966)

The gallery is stark, white, and mostly empty. It's the night before an exhibition opens. JOHN LENNON (26), looking restless and slightly bored in his famous round glasses, wanders through the space. He's here at the invitation of the owner, looking for a distraction from his life of suburban ennui.

He examines a piece: an apple on a pedestal with a price tag for £200. He scoffs quietly. He moves to another piece, "Hammer A Nail": a pristine white board with a hammer hanging beside it and a jar of nails.

Intrigued, he picks up the hammer.

YOKO ONO (33), small and serene in a black turtleneck, emerges from the back of the gallery.

  YOKO
  You cannot. The show does not open until tomorrow.

Her voice is calm, firm. Not impressed by his fame, only concerned with the integrity of her art. John puts the hammer down, a flicker of amusement in his eyes.

  JOHN
  Can I not hammer one nail in? For a price?

  YOKO
  (considers this)
  It would disrupt the concept. The piece is about participation, but participation in its proper time.

The GALLERY OWNER (40s, suave) approaches them, sensing a delicate situation.

  GALLERY OWNER
  Yoko, darling. Perhaps an exception? Let the gentleman hammer a nail in... for five shillings.

Yoko considers this. John smirks, reaching into his pocket, then stops. He looks at Yoko, a glint of mischief in his eye.

  JOHN
  Alright. I'll give you an imaginary five shillings... and I'll hammer in an imaginary nail.

Yoko stares at him. The corner of her mouth twitches into a small, appreciative smile. He gets it. He's playing her game.

  YOKO
  (a small nod)
  Acceptable.

John mimes hammering a nail into the board, making a quiet "tink, tink, tink" sound. She watches, her expression unreadable.

He turns away, his eyes scanning the room. They land on a tall, white stepladder standing in the middle of the gallery. At the top, a small magnifying glass hangs from the ceiling on a chain.

  JOHN
  And what's that meant to be?

  YOKO
  That is "Ceiling Painting." You must climb the ladder to experience it.

John, skeptical, approaches the ladder and starts his climb. His face alternates between amused and annoyed. The gallery owner looks nervous. Yoko just watches, impassive.

John reaches the top, unsteady. He grabs the hanging magnifying glass and holds it up to a tiny, almost invisible word painted on the ceiling. He squints.

CLOSE-UP: Through the magnifying glass, we see the word, written in tiny, neat block letters:

"YES"

John stares at it for a long moment. A slow smile spreads across his face. It's a smile of pure relief. In a world that felt increasingly negative and complicated, he found a simple, positive word.

He lowers the glass and looks down at Yoko, who is looking up at him. Their eyes meet. It's not a look of romance, but of profound, startling recognition.

He climbs down the ladder, his earlier cynicism completely gone.

  JOHN
  (quietly, to her)
  It's the first art show I've been to that hasn't made me want to leave immediately.

  YOKO
  Art that only says "no" is not a conversation. It's a statement. I prefer conversation.

John nods, understanding completely. He gives her a final, appraising look, then turns and walks out of the gallery into the London night.

Yoko watches him go, a serene, thoughtful expression on her face.
