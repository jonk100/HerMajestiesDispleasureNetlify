SCENE START

INT. SOHO BOOKSHOP - DAY (EARLY 1966)

A cramped, atmospheric independent bookshop. Floor-to-ceiling shelves packed with esoteric texts create narrow, maze-like aisles. A small corner is dedicated to imported vinyl LPs. The air is thick with the scent of old paper and sandalwood incense.

NIGEL FINCH (49) stands behind the counter, transformed. Gone is the weary bureaucrat. He wears a comfortable cardigan, half-moon reading glasses, and has cultivated a slightly bohemian air. He is the picture of a man who has found peace among books.

The shop bell CHIMES softly. GEORGE HARRISON (23) enters. He’s fresh from the success of Rubber Soul, but a searching uncertainty hangs about him. He used the sitar on "Norwegian Wood," but knows he only scratched the surface. It was a texture, not an art form.

George wanders toward the Eastern Philosophy section, his fingers trailing along book spines. He pauses on Practical Lessons in Yoga by Swami Sivananda, reads the back cover, then gently returns it to the shelf. Next to it, The Science of Pranayama — he flips it open, stares at a diagram of alternate nostril breathing, and shakes his head. He picks up The Book of Tea by Okakura Kakuzō, runs a thumb across its worn edge, then places it back like a fragile artifact. A stray, dog-eared copy of Howl by Allen Ginsberg is shoved between the titles — George smirks faintly, sets it aside.

Finally, he pulls out a volume by Alan Watts — The Way of Zen. He flips through it, slows on a paragraph about silence and direct experience, then replaces it with a small sigh.

Nigel observes from behind his glasses, timing his approach. He walks to a small record player behind the counter and gently drops the needle on a spinning LP. A complex, mesmerizing SITAR melody fills the quiet shop. The sound is impossibly rich and fluid.

George looks up, captivated. He approaches the counter.

  GEORGE
  What is that?

  NIGEL
  (without looking up, as if stating a fact of nature)
  That is Ravi Shankar. The source.

George listens, rapt. The gulf between this and his own playing feels immense.

  GEORGE
  It’s… a whole other world. I’ve been… dabbling with one. A sitar. But it doesn't sound like that.

Nigel looks up, his expression one of gentle, academic interest.

  NIGEL
  (a flicker of a knowing smile)
  Ah. Yes. A common observation. One can acquire the instrument, but the philosophy... that must be sought.

The word "philosophy" lands perfectly. It’s exactly what George feels is missing.

  GEORGE
  Exactly. It feels like there's something more. Beyond just the notes.

  NIGEL
  (nodding sagely)
  Because there is. The sitar is not merely a collection of strings and wood. It’s a discipline. A path. To play it correctly, one must understand the silence between the notes. The unstruck sound.

This resonates deeply. It’s the language he's been trying to find.

  GEORGE
  But how do you even begin to learn that? It seems… impossibly complex.

Nigel feigns a thoughtful pause, as if accessing a piece of cultural trivia.

  NIGEL
  It’s interesting you should ask. There's another young man, a customer. From that group, The Rolling Stones. The blond one.
  (a dismissive wave)
  A bit more... frantic, their music. But he is a very serious student.

This piques George's interest intensely. A peer. A rival, even.

  GEORGE
  Brian Jones?

  NIGEL
  (snapping his fingers softly)
  That's the one. He tells me the only way to truly understand the music is to go to the master himself. He’s been taking lessons. From Mr. Shankar.

The pieces click into place for George. It’s not just about practice; it's about apprenticeship. A lineage.

  NIGEL (CONT'D)
  He says Shankar is... particular. He doesn't suffer fools or dilettantes. One must demonstrate a genuine spiritual commitment.

Nigel is now performing the most sophisticated kind of manipulation: using the truth. He's not inventing a path; he's merely illuminating it, framing it as a challenge worthy of George's deep spirit, while subtly positioning the more "frantic" Brian Jones as someone who has already started the journey.

George looks determined. This isn't just about music anymore. It's about creative and spiritual respect.

  GEORGE
  Ravi Shankar. He lives here? In London?

Nigel takes a small slip of paper from a notepad. He writes the name on it with a fountain pen, his handwriting neat and precise.

  NIGEL
  He visits. One has to be… attentive. But I believe a man like Brian Jones would know how to make an introduction, if one were to ask. One seeker to another.

He slides the paper across the counter. It contains only two words: "Ravi Shankar."

  GEORGE
  (taking the paper)
  Thank you.

  NIGEL
  (with a slight, formal bow)
  The path appears when the student is ready.

George tucks the paper carefully into his jacket pocket. It feels like a key. He gives Nigel a grateful nod and exits.

Nigel watches him go. He calmly turns back to his leather-bound journal—his operational log, disguised as a shop ledger. He finds the page headed "OPERATION MINUET - SUBJECT: HARRISON, G." and makes a new entry in his precise, bureaucratic script.

  NIGEL (V.O.)
  (reading his own writing)
  Vector Identified: B. Jones (Rolling Stones). Target primed with information regarding subject’s tutelage under R. Shankar. Path to spiritual and artistic divergence successfully illuminated. Subject believes discovery to be his own.

He closes the book. The music of Ravi Shankar plays on, now sounding less like a beautiful melody and more like the soundtrack to a perfectly executed act of bureaucratic sabotage.
