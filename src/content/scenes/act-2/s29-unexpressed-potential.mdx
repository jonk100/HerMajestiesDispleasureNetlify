s-INT. CLIVE BARROW’S FLAT – NIGHT

a-A cramped bedsit. Papers everywhere.
a-A single electric heater clicks on and off like a metronome.
a-The air smells faintly of stale tobacco and wet wool.

a-This is not a home so much as a staging area.
a-Envelopes stacked by size.
a-Carbon paper.
a-A battered address book.
a-A dog-eared road atlas of the United States, opened to the South.

a-Clive sits at his desk, staring at a blank sheet of paper in his typewriter.

a-He inserts it.

a-Types:

a-“Dear Sir—”

a-Stops.

a-Backspaces furiously.

a-He reaches for a pencil and scribbles on a scrap:
a-"RESPECTABLE MOUTH."
a-"ORDINARY." 
a-"NOT ME." 

a-He underlines the last one so hard the pencil snaps.

a-He stands, paces.

a-Picks up the newspaper headline.

a-“LENNON QUESTIONS CHRISTIANITY.”

a-He smiles.

c-CLIVE
p-(to himself)
d-They never ask the right audience.

a-He opens a drawer.
a-Inside: a thin sheaf of forms—names and addresses in neat columns.
a-Not official forms. Something he’s made to look official.

a-He flips to a page headed:
a-"PERSONAE." 

a-Under it:
a-"MRS. GLADYS PEMBERTON — Birmingham, Alabama (churchgoing, widow)" 
a-"REV. HAROLD K. SLOANE — Jackson, Mississippi (youth sermon tone)" 
a-"MR. WILLIAM D. TANNER — Dallas, Texas (veteran, law-and-order)" 

a-He reads them like characters in a play.

a-He sits again.

a-Types:

a-“As a concerned—”

a-Stops.

a-He rips the page out cleanly.
a-Lays it on a growing pile of false starts.

a-Then he tries again.
a-This time, he types slower. With care.

a-CLOSE on the paper as words appear:
a-"...as a mother and lifelong reader..."
a-"...as a Christian man who served his country..."
a-"...as a pastor responsible for young minds..."

a-Clive stops.
a-He stares at the three openings.
a-Three different voices.
a-The same knife.

a-He pulls the paper out. Crumples it.
a-Crumples the other two as well.
a-Too pleased with themselves.

a-Sits back, breathing hard.

a-He looks at a map pinned to the wall — red dots scattered across the U.S. South.

a-Alabama circled.

a-Mississippi.

a-Texas.

a-On the desk, a small stack of clippings—religious columnists, local paper mastheads.
a-A cheap rubber stamp kit.
a-Empty space where a return address ought to be.

a-Clive takes out a sheet of plain labels.
a-He types one line.
a-Peels it carefully.
a-Sticks it to an envelope.

a-Then he stops.
a-As if he’s heard footsteps in a corridor that isn’t there.

a-He reaches for the typewriter again.

a-Hovers.

a-Doesn’t type.

a-He gathers the crumpled drafts and smooths one flat.
a-Not to save it—
a-to prove to himself it existed.

a-He slides the persona sheet, the atlas, and the headline into a manila folder.
a-He writes on the tab, in block capitals:
a-"FEEDBACK." 

a-He places it beside his coat.
a-Ready for morning.

a-He turns off the light.

a-The typewriter remains loaded.

a-Waiting.

t-CUT TO BLACK.
