SCENE START

Daddy's Gone Away

FADE IN:

INT. TWICKENHAM FILM STUDIOS - DAY (JANUARY 7, 1969)

The same cold soundstage. The equipment, the cameras, the fluorescent lights. But the energy is different today - not just tense, but existential. The band is questioning why they're even here.

JOHN LENNON (28) sits at the piano, doodling musically. YOKO ONO (36) sits nearby, knitting. Her presence is now unremarkable - part of the furniture.

GEORGE HARRISON (25) looks particularly weary today, like a man who's made a decision but hasn't announced it yet.

PAUL MCCARTNEY (26) stands, pacing, trying to generate momentum that simply isn't there.

RINGO STARR (28) sits behind his drums, watching the dynamic unfold.

MICHAEL LINDSAY-HOGG (30s), the director, hovers nearby with his crew, cameras rolling.

  JOHN
  (to no one in particular)
  I think we are just repeating all the dullness.

Paul stops pacing. That stung.

  PAUL
  (pressing the question)
  We gotta have some serious reason for doing this or else we won't. What's it for? Can't be for the money.

  JOHN
  (actually engaging)
  I've decided the whole point of it is communication. And to be on TV is communication. We've got a chance to smile at people, like 'All You Need Is Love.' So that's my incentive for doing it.

  MICHAEL LINDSAY-HOGG
  (trying to help)
  If this comes off, we've got a great entertainment package. We've got an album, a documentary never seen before, and a performance. It's a great package.

  JOHN
  (with a shrug)
  The worst that we have is a documentary of us making an LP, if we don't get into a show.

Paul's frustration is building. John's treating this so casually, like it doesn't matter.

  PAUL
  (erupting)
  But we haven't played together, you see. That's the fucking thing. But when we do come together to play, we all just sort of talk about the fucking past! We're like old age pensioners. 'Remember the days when we used to rock?' You know, but we're here now, and we can do it, you know?

He looks at them, desperate for some sign of life.

  PAUL (CONT'D)
  But, I mean, all I want to see is enthusiasm! See, the thing is also I get to a bit where I just sort of push all my ideas. You know, I mean, a lot will come out of it if we could get the enthusiasm. I mean, why are you here? I'm here 'cause I wanna do a show. But I really don't feel an awful lot of support.

The words hang in the air. George shifts in his seat, and when he speaks, there's a resignation in his voice.

  GEORGE
  We keep coming up against that one and I keep saying, 'Yeah well, I'd like to do this, this and that.' And we end up doing something again that nobody really wants to do.

  PAUL
  (the threat implicit)
  If this one turns into that, it should definitely be the last for all of us. Because there just isn't any point.

  MICHAEL LINDSAY-HOGG
  I think that'd be sad. I mean, as an audience. That'd be sad.

  PAUL
  (bitter)
  Course it is! It's stupid. It is just stupid. You see, the people who are being stupid are the four of us.

  GEORGE
  (finally naming it)
  We need to be creative instead of being the doldrums, which it always is. The Beatles have been in doldrums for at least a year.

A year. Since Brian Epstein died. Everyone knows it, but no one's said it so directly.

Paul takes a breath. When he speaks again, there's a vulnerability beneath the frustration.

  PAUL
  (the core truth)
  Ever since Mr. Epstein passed away, it's never been the same. I mean, we've been very negative since Mr. Epstein passed away. And that's why all of us, in turn, have been sick of the group. It's discipline we lack. We've never had discipline.

He's working through it as he speaks, finding the words.

  PAUL (CONT'D)
  We had a sort of slight, symbolic discipline. Like Mr. Epstein. You know, and he sort of said, 'Get suits on,' and we did. You know, and so we were always fighting that discipline a bit. There really is no one there now to say, 'Do it.' Whereas there always used to be.

A pause. Then the devastating metaphor.

  PAUL (CONT'D)
  (quietly)
  Daddy's gone away now, and we're on our own at the holiday camp. I think we either go home or we do it.

The words land heavily. John looks down at the piano keys. George stares at his guitar. Even Yoko pauses in her knitting.

Michael Lindsay-Hogg, sensing an opening, tries to push the conversation forward.

  MICHAEL LINDSAY-HOGG
  Do you still wanna perform in front of an audience, or do you just see yourselves as a recording group?

  PAUL
  (to John)
  I think we've got a bit shy, I think I've got a bit shy of certain things, you know. 'Cause you know how often, like, on albums we sometimes blow one of your songs, 'cause we come in in the wrong mood. And you say, 'This is how it goes. I'll be back.' And we're all just, 'Oh, well you…'

  MICHAEL LINDSAY-HOGG
  That's why we're wrong to throw away the show. Because there's no desire.

  PAUL
  (building momentum)
  So it's like, if we're doing the show, we're gonna have to work hard. And that means by the time a week from now comes all these songs we've got, we've gotta know perfectly.

George has been quiet, but now he speaks, and there's defeat in his voice.

  GEORGE
  I don't wanna do any of my songs on the show. Because they just turn out shitty…

  PAUL
  (trying to encourage)
  No, but this… Thinking it's not gonna come out great won't help. If we cancel the show now, we'll be throwing it away.

  MICHAEL LINDSAY-HOGG
  But equally, at the moment we haven't got a show and so none of us really want to do it.

  PAUL
  (his patience snapping)
  I'll do it. I'm not interested, you know, to spend my fucking days farting around here, while everyone makes up their minds whether they want to do it or not. It's like Mal said last night, 'If you're gonna do the show here, you've gotta decide today.' And as far as I can see, there's only two ways. We're gonna do it, or we're not gonna do it. And I want a decision!

The demand echoes in the vast space. No one responds immediately.

Then George says it. Quietly, but clearly.

  GEORGE
  Maybe we should have a divorce.

The word sits there. Divorce. Like they're a marriage that's failed.

  PAUL
  (with a sad smile)
  Well, I said that at the last meeting. But it's getting nearer, you know?

A beat. Then John, unable to resist, makes a joke.

  JOHN
  Who'd have the children?

  PAUL
  (playing along, grateful for the levity)
  Dick James.

  JOHN
  (laughing)
  Oh, yeah.

The moment of humor defuses the tension, but doesn't solve anything. They're still sitting in a cold studio, unable to agree on why they're here or what they're doing.

The cameras continue rolling. The fluorescent lights buzz. The Beatles sit with their instruments, having just discussed their own divorce.

Ringo hasn't said a word the entire conversation. He just sits at his drums, the peacekeeper who knows there's no peace to keep anymore.

FADE TO BLACK.
