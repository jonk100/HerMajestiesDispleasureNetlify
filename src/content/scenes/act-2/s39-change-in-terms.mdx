t-FADE IN:

s-INT. BUCKINGHAM PALACE PRIVATE STUDY - NIGHT (LATE NOVEMBER 1969)

a-The room is dark, save for a single green-shaded lamp on the heavy desk, casting long, menacing shadows. The atmosphere is funereal.

a-PRINCE PHILIP (48) stands by the fireplace, staring into the flames. He is unnervingly still. The explosive rage from the afternoon has cooled into something far more dangerous: icy, resolute calm.

a-LORD MOUNTBATTEN (69) sits in a leather armchair, a glass of brandy untouched beside him.

a-SIR DEREK FINCHLEY (58), the Deputy Director of MI5, sits opposite him, looking deeply uneasy. He holds a slim, empty portfolio on his lap. He was summoned, not invited.

a-The QUEEN is notably absent. This is not a state matter anymore. This is personal.

c-MOUNTBATTEN
p-(Breaking the silence)
d-The press is treating it as a celebrity tantrum. The Times called the 'Cold Turkey' reference 'gauche'. In a week, it will be forgotten. In a strategic sense, the operation was a success. The group is fractured beyond repair. The primary objective has been met.

a-Philip turns slowly from the fire. His face is a mask.

c-PRINCE PHILIP
d-The primary objective? Was it?
p-(He walks slowly toward the desk)
d-The objective, as I recall, was to neutralize a nuisance. To remind these people of the proper order of things.

a-He stops, looking down at Finchley, who shrinks slightly under his gaze.

c-PRINCE PHILIP (CONT'D)
d-Instead, we have created a political symbol. We have spent four years turning a court jester into a Joan of Arc. He's more dangerous now than he ever was with a guitar.

c-MOUNTBATTEN
d-He's a musician, Philip. His influence is... ephemeral.

c-PRINCE PHILIP
p-(A sharp, cold laugh)
d-Is it? He's met with prime ministers. He holds press conferences about world peace from a bed. He has the ear of an entire generation. And now, he has a legitimate grievance. He has our attention. And we gave it to him.

a-Finchley shifts uncomfortably in his chair. He is a bureaucrat, a man of plausible deniability. This conversation is becoming dangerously concrete.

c-SIR DEREK FINCHLEY
d-Your Highness, MI5's official assessment is that while Lennon is a person of interest, he does not constitute a direct threat to national—

c-PRINCE PHILIP
p-(Cutting him off, his voice like ice)
d-Your 'official assessment' is a document designed to protect your pension, Sir Derek. I am talking about reality.
p-(He leans on the desk, his voice dropping)
d-The man has publicly accused the Crown of complicity in war. He has used an honour from the Sovereign as a political weapon. He is no longer a nuisance. He is a dissident. And dissidents... must be managed.

a-Mountbatten senses where this is going. He sits up, his expression hardening.

c-MOUNTBATTEN
d-Philip, we must be exceedingly careful here. Any overt action would be catastrophic.

c-PRINCE PHILIP
d-I am not suggesting an overt action. I am suggesting a final one.

a-The room goes utterly still. Finchley looks like he wants to dissolve into the floor. This is a line he never, ever wanted to cross.

c-PRINCE PHILIP (CONT'D)
d-Operation Minuet was a success in its tactics, but its strategy was flawed. It was a dance. It was about disruption. The terms have now changed.

a-He looks directly at Mountbatten, the command clear in his eyes.

c-PRINCE PHILIP (CONT'D)
d-Operation Minuet is terminated. Effective immediately.
p-(He pauses, letting the finality sink in)
d-We are activating a new protocol. Operation... 'Elegy'.

c-MOUNTBATTEN
p-(Quietly)
d-An elegy is a funeral song.

c-PRINCE PHILIP
d-Precisely. This is no longer about disruption, Dickie. This is about silencing a threat. Permanently.

a-Sir Derek Finchley visibly pales. This is no longer a cynical game of psychological manipulation. This is a royal directive for an assassination.

c-SIR DEREK FINCHLEY
p-(Stammering)
d-Your... Your Highness... that is... such a measure would be... unprecedented. The blowback...

c-PRINCE PHILIP
p-(Straightening up, his voice regaining its command)
d-The blowback for allowing a public figure to repeatedly and publicly defy the Crown is far greater. That is the very definition of sedition.
p-(To Mountbatten)
d-I want a plan. Quiet. Plausible. Final. Use the same assets. They are already compromised.

a-Mountbatten stares at his nephew, seeing the full extent of his obsession. The protector of the monarchy has become its greatest liability. But an order has been given.

c-MOUNTBATTEN
p-(After a long silence, a slight, almost imperceptible nod)
d-As you wish.

a-Philip turns back to the fire, his back to them both. The decision is made. The conversation is over.

a-Finchley sits frozen, clutching his portfolio, a man trapped in a waking nightmare. He has just become accessory to a plot he wants no part of, ordered by a man he cannot refuse.

t-FADE OUT.
