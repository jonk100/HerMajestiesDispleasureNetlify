t-FADE IN:

s-INT. TWICKENHAM FILM STUDIOS - DAY (JANUARY 10, 1969)

a-Morning rehearsal. The Beatles are working through "Get Back" with genuine momentum. PAUL at piano, JOHN on guitar, GEORGE on his Fender Strat, RINGO keeping steady rhythm. For the first time today, it feels like music.

a-They're finding a groove. The song is coming together.

c-PAUL
p-(excited, finding the rhythm)
d-Yeah, that's it! The way the bass walks up there...

a-Then a PRODUCTION RUNNER (20s) appears at the edge of the soundstage, clipboard in hand, looking nervous but determined.

c-PRODUCTION RUNNER
p-(tentatively)
d-Excuse me, Mr. Lindsay-Hogg?

a-MICHAEL LINDSAY-HOGG breaks away from the cameras.

c-MICHAEL LINDSAY-HOGG
p-(impatient)
d-What is it? We're rolling.

c-PRODUCTION RUNNER
p-(checking clipboard)
d-Just need to confirm - are we still doing the Libya segment? The scaffolding crew needs to know whether to strike the set.

a-The music falters. JOHN stops playing, looks over. PAUL's enthusiasm deflates.

c-PAUL
p-(to Michael)
d-Libya segment?

c-MICHAEL LINDSAY-HOGG
p-(waving it off)
d-That's for later. We're working on the song now.

a-The runner scurries away. The Beatles pick up their instruments again. But the moment is broken.

c-GEORGE
p-(quietly, to himself)
d-Libya segment.

a-They try again. The music starts, slower this time, more tentative.

t-CUT TO:

s-INT. TWICKENHAM FILM STUDIOS - LATER

a-They've found the groove again. "Get Back" is sounding better, tighter. JOHN is actually smiling, PAUL is bouncing on the piano bench.

a-Then a CAMERA OPERATOR starts repositioning his equipment, making loud scraping noises.

c-CAMERA OPERATOR
p-(calling out)
d-Sorry, the light's wrong! We need to move this rig.

a-Michael Lindsay-Hogg rushes over, gesturing frantically. The Beatles stop playing again.

c-MICHAEL LINDSAY-HOGG
p-(to the band)
d-Just give us two minutes! Two minutes and we'll be golden.

a-GEORGE sits down on his amp, takes out a cigarette. He's not angry, just... smaller. Each interruption chips away at him.

c-JOHN
p-(to Paul, sarcastic)
d-Always something, isn't there?

c-PAUL
p-(trying to be positive)
d-It's a big production, John. We knew that.

a-But even he doesn't sound convinced. The cameras keep rolling, documenting the pauses, the interruptions, the slow erosion of creative flow.

t-FADE OUT.
