t-FADE IN:

a-MONTAGE

s-INT. RAVI SHANKAR'S HOME, BOMBAY - DAY (SUMMER 1966)

a-A simple, elegant room. Sunlight streams through slatted blinds. No gold records, no pop art. Just rugs, incense, and a profound sense of peace.

a-GEORGE HARRISON (23), dressed in a simple white kurta, sits cross-legged on the floor. His posture is awkward; he's not used to this. His expensive Western boots are left neatly by the door.

a-Across from him sits RAVI SHANKAR (46), the picture of dignified authority. He holds his sitar with effortless grace.

c-RAVI SHANKAR
p-(calmly, but firm)
d-Before you touch the instrument, you must learn to sit. Before you learn to sit, you must learn to be still. Your mind is a storm of... distractions. Fame. Deadlines. You must leave it all outside. Here, you are not a Beatle. You are a student.

a-George nods, humbled. He tries to straighten his back, focusing on his breathing. His fingers twitch, eager to play, but he forces them to be still.

s-INT. RAVI SHANKAR'S HOME - DAY

a-DAYS LATER. George holds a sitar. It rests clumsily in his lap. Ravi Shankar adjusts George's hands on the strings, his touch precise.

c-RAVI SHANKAR
d-No, no. Not with force. The note is already there. You are not creating it. You are... revealing it. Let your finger be like a feather.

a-George tries again. A harsh, buzzing sound comes out. He winces.

c-GEORGE
d-Sorry.

c-RAVI SHANKAR
d-Do not be sorry. Be patient. Your guitar wants to fight the string. The sitar must persuade it. It will take years. Are you prepared for that?

a-George looks at the master, his expression deadly serious.

c-GEORGE
d-Yes.

s-EXT. DAL LAKE, KASHMIR - HOUSEBOAT - EVENING

a-WEEKS LATER. George and Ravi sit on the deck of a houseboat, floating on a serene lake surrounded by majestic mountains. The cacophony of the world feels a million miles away.

a-George is playing a simple raga, a basic scale. His playing is still hesitant, but it's cleaner, more fluid. He is focused, his eyes closed. He is listening.

a-Ravi listens, not with a teacher's critical ear, but with a growing sense of respect. He sees the sincerity.

a-The lesson ends. The sun sets over the mountains.

c-GEORGE
p-(quietly)
d-Back in London... it's all about what's next. The next single, the next album. It never stops. Here... it feels like time doesn't exist.

c-RAVI SHANKAR
d-Because it doesn't. There is only the note. And the silence before it. Everything else is illusion. Maya.

a-The word "maya" hangs in the air. For George, it's a revelation. It gives a name to the emptiness he's been feeling amidst the screaming fans and gold records.

c-GEORGE
d-Maya.

a-He looks out at the water, a profound sense of peace settling over him. He is no longer just a musician learning a new instrument. He is a seeker who has found his path.

a-The camera holds on his face, serene and content. He is a world away from John's restless intellectualism and Paul's diplomatic anxieties.

a-A title card appears over the tranquil scene: **AUGUST 1966. The Beatles begin their final, chaotic tour of America.**

a-The peaceful sound of the sitar fades, replaced by the faint, distant sound of screaming fans.
