s-INT. NEWSPAPER OFFICE – DAY

a-Typewriters clatter. Phones ring. Cigarette smoke hangs low.

a-A JUNIOR REPORTER stands at an editor’s desk, Maureen Cleave’s article in hand.

c-JUNIOR REPORTER
d-It’s thoughtful. Bit long.

c-EDITOR
d-Thoughtful doesn’t sell.

a-The editor scans the page.

c-EDITOR (CONT’D)
d-What’s the hook?

c-JUNIOR REPORTER
d-He talks about religion. Fame. Meaning.

c-EDITOR
d-Underline.

a-The junior reporter underlines a passage.

c-EDITOR
d-No, the other bit.

a-He flips the page.

c-EDITOR (CONT’D)
d-“More popular than Jesus.”

a-The reporter hesitates.

c-JUNIOR REPORTER
d-That’s not really the point—

c-EDITOR
d-It is now.

a-The editor grabs a pencil, circles the line.

c-EDITOR (CONT’D)
d-That’s your pull quote.

c-JUNIOR REPORTER
d-Out of context.

c-EDITOR
p-(shrugs)
d-Context is optional.

a-He scribbles a headline.

a-“LENNON QUESTIONS CHRISTIANITY.”

c-JUNIOR REPORTER
d-Should we at least run the rest with it?

c-EDITOR
d-Of course. We’re not animals.

a-The editor lights a cigarette.

c-EDITOR (CONT’D)
d-But that line goes on page one.

a-The reporter nods, uneasy.

a-As he leaves, the editor calls after him—

c-EDITOR
d-And trim the philosophy. Readers don’t like homework.
