s-INT. TWICKENHAM FILM STUDIOS - DAY

a-The Beatles are trying to work out the structure of "Get Back." JOHN and PAUL are arguing, going in circles.

c-PAUL
p-(frustrated)
d-No, the middle eight needs to go somewhere. It can't just sit there.

c-JOHN
p-(sarcastic)
d-Where should it go, then? Up your arse?

c-PAUL
p-(ignoring the sarcasm)
d-Maybe we should drop the key there, give it some lift.

c-JOHN
d-We already tried that. It sounded like a funeral march.

a-They go back and forth, playing fragments, arguing chords. RINGO sits patiently, waiting. GEORGE stands apart from them, quietly watching, listening.

a-After several minutes of this, GEORGE steps forward. He doesn't say anything. He just picks up his guitar and plays a different chord progression under the same melody.

a-It's subtle but transformative. The way he voices the chords creates movement, gives the middle eight direction without changing key dramatically. It resolves the tension between Paul's desire for lift and John's resistance to obvious changes.

a-The song clicks. Suddenly it works.

c-PAUL
p-(immediately, excited)
d-Yes! That's it! See, I told you we just needed...

a-He's already turned to John, taking credit, explaining what "we" figured out. JOHN nods, impressed with the solution.

c-JOHN
d-That's better. Much better.

a-Neither of them looks at GEORGE. Neither acknowledges that he was the one who found the solution. They immediately start arguing about the next section.

c-PAUL
p-(to John)
d-Now if we can just get the intro right...

c-JOHN
p-(already moving on)
d-The intro's fine, it's the outro that's...

a-GEORGE doesn't protest. He doesn't try to claim his contribution. He just stands there, watching them argue over the song he just fixed.

a-A small, knowing smile plays on his lips. He clocks it. He understands now.

a-He quietly puts his guitar down, walks over to his amp, and adjusts something. The others don't even notice he's moved.

c-GEORGE
p-(to himself, barely audible)
d-Right.

a-That's it. That's the moment. Not anger, not frustration. Just quiet recognition. He's proven his point, and no one saw it. That silence becomes his decision.

t-FADE OUT.
