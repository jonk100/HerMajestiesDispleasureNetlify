SCENE START

George and Ravi

FADE IN:

MONTAGE

INT. RAVI SHANKAR'S HOME, BOMBAY - DAY (SUMMER 1966)

A simple, elegant room. Sunlight streams through slatted blinds. No gold records, no pop art. Just rugs, incense, and a profound sense of peace.

GEORGE HARRISON (23), dressed in a simple white kurta, sits cross-legged on the floor. His posture is awkward; he's not used to this. His expensive Western boots are left neatly by the door.

Across from him sits RAVI SHANKAR (46), the picture of dignified authority. He holds his sitar with effortless grace.

  RAVI SHANKAR
  (calmly, but firm)
  Before you touch the instrument, you must learn to sit. Before you learn to sit, you must learn to be still. Your mind is a storm of... distractions. Fame. Deadlines. You must leave it all outside. Here, you are not a Beatle. You are a student.

George nods, humbled. He tries to straighten his back, focusing on his breathing. His fingers twitch, eager to play, but he forces them to be still.

INT. RAVI SHANKAR'S HOME - DAY

DAYS LATER. George holds a sitar. It rests clumsily in his lap. Ravi Shankar adjusts George's hands on the strings, his touch precise.

  RAVI SHANKAR
  No, no. Not with force. The note is already there. You are not creating it. You are... revealing it. Let your finger be like a feather.

George tries again. A harsh, buzzing sound comes out. He winces.

  GEORGE
  Sorry.

  RAVI SHANKAR
  Do not be sorry. Be patient. Your guitar wants to fight the string. The sitar must persuade it. It will take years. Are you prepared for that?

George looks at the master, his expression deadly serious.

  GEORGE
  Yes.

EXT. DAL LAKE, KASHMIR - HOUSEBOAT - EVENING

WEEKS LATER. George and Ravi sit on the deck of a houseboat, floating on a serene lake surrounded by majestic mountains. The cacophony of the world feels a million miles away.

George is playing a simple raga, a basic scale. His playing is still hesitant, but it's cleaner, more fluid. He is focused, his eyes closed. He is listening.

Ravi listens, not with a teacher's critical ear, but with a growing sense of respect. He sees the sincerity.

The lesson ends. The sun sets over the mountains.

  GEORGE
  (quietly)
  Back in London... it's all about what's next. The next single, the next album. It never stops. Here... it feels like time doesn't exist.

  RAVI SHANKAR
  Because it doesn't. There is only the note. And the silence before it. Everything else is illusion. Maya.

The word "maya" hangs in the air. For George, it's a revelation. It gives a name to the emptiness he's been feeling amidst the screaming fans and gold records.

  GEORGE
  Maya.

He looks out at the water, a profound sense of peace settling over him. He is no longer just a musician learning a new instrument. He is a seeker who has found his path.

The camera holds on his face, serene and content. He is a world away from John's restless intellectualism and Paul's diplomatic anxieties.

A title card appears over the tranquil scene:

**AUGUST 1966. The Beatles begin their final, chaotic tour of America.**

The peaceful sound of the sitar fades, replaced by the faint, distant sound of screaming fans.
