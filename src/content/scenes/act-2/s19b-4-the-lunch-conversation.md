SCENE START

The Lunch Conversation

FADE IN:

INT. TWICKENHAM FILM STUDIOS - CAFETERIA - DAY (JANUARY 13, 1969)

Three days after George left. The small cafeteria feels intimate, private. A long table with a flowerpot in the center - a flowerpot containing a hidden microphone that JOHN and PAUL don't know about.

JOHN LENNON (28) sits across from PAUL MCCARTNEY (26). They're alone for this conversation, though LINDA EASTMAN and YOKO ONO are elsewhere in the building.

This is rare - John and Paul talking honestly, without the others present. The weight of George's absence hangs over everything.

  JOHN
  (trying to articulate it)
  It's like George said, he didn't get enough satisfaction anymore, because of the compromise he had to make to be together. It's a festering wound that we've allowed to... and yesterday we allowed it to go even deeper, and we didn't give him any bandages. And when he is that far in, we have egos.

Paul nods. He's been thinking about this too.

  PAUL
  The thing is, that's what I was trying to say to George, you know. Whereas previously I would have said, 'Take it there with diddle-der-diddle-der'. But I was trying last week to say, 'Now take it there. Anything you like. Put whatever you...'

  JOHN
  (cutting to it)
  You see, the point is now, we both do that to George this time, and because of the build-up to it—

  PAUL
  Yeah, we treat him a bit like that. See, 'cause he knows what we're on about. But I do think that he's right. That's why I think we've got the problem now, you know, the four of us. You go one way, George one way, and me another. But I know it'll apply to all of us, if one day you can all be singing like you sing. George can be really playing, I mean, like he plays, not like I keep trying to make him play.

John shifts in his seat. Now they're getting to the core of it.

  JOHN
  Yeah, OK, because you're afraid that how he'll play won't be like you want him to play, and that's what we do, and that's what you do to me. And I'm not gonna tell you what to play.

  PAUL
  (trying to defend)
  See, that... that seems to be the trouble, is that if you'd have been able to say that on the occasion, just even to say, 'Look, I'm not gonna say anything about the song because it's very difficult, I'm gonna really try and now...'

  JOHN
  (the deeper issue)
  You know, I've always done the numbers like that. Now, the only regret about the past numbers is when, because I've been so frightened, I've allowed you to take it somewhere where I didn't want. And then, that my only chance was to let George take over, or interest George in it. If you give me your suggestions, let me reject them and pinch the ones I like... is where my writing side is. Same goes for the arranging. I don't want it to... I don't know.

  PAUL
  (quietly, understanding)
  I know. I do know. I know what you mean, yeah.

  JOHN
  (the accusation, but said gently)
  'Cause there was a period where none of us could actually say anything about your arrangements 'cause you would reject it all. I'd have to tell George and I would just say, you know, like you do about me. You know, 'I'm Paul McCartney', and a lot of the times you were right, and a lot of the times you were wrong. Same as we always are. But I can't see the answer to that, because you've suddenly got it all, you see.

  PAUL
  I really don't want you...

  JOHN
  (continuing)
  Well all right. I'm just telling you what I think. I don't— The Beatles revolve around the four people. It might a fucking job.

  PAUL
  (the power dynamic)
  You know, but I tell you what. I tell you one thing, what I think. The main thing is this: you have always been boss. Now I've been, sort of, secondary boss.

  JOHN
  Not always.

  PAUL
  (insistent)
  No, listen. Listen. No, always! Really, I mean, it is gonna be much better if we can actually just stick together and say, 'Look George, on 'I've Got A Feeling' I want you to do it exactly like I play it.' And he'll say, 'I'm not you, and I can't do it exactly like you do it.'

John considers this. There's truth in it.

  JOHN
  But this year, what you've been doing, and what everybody's been doing, I've not only felt guilty about the way we're all guilty about our relationship to each other, 'cause we could do more. And look, I'm not putting any blame on you. I've suddenly realised this, because that was my game, you know, but goals, they're still the same. Self-preservation, you know. I know what I like, I've let you do what you want and George too, you know.

  PAUL
  Yeah, I know.

  JOHN
  If we want him, if we do want him, I can go along with that, because the policy has kept us together.

  PAUL
  (the hope, or delusion)
  Well, I don't know, you know. See, I'm just assuming he's coming back. If he isn't, then he isn't, then it's a new problem. And probably when we're all very old, we'll all agree with each other, and we'll all sing together.

A pause. John circles back to the creative process itself.

  JOHN
  (trying to explain)
  And that's all I did on the last album was say, 'Okay, Paul, you're out to decide where my songs are concerned, arrangement-wise'. I don't know the songs, you know. I'd sooner just sing them, than have them turn into 'Mr. Kite', or anything else, where— I've accepted the problem from you that it needs arrangement. And then, because I'm an ape, I don't know. I don't see any further than me, the guitar, and the drums, and George Martin doing the— I don't hear any of the flutes playing, you know?

He makes a strumming gesture.

  JOHN (CONT'D)
  I suppose I could hear 'em if I sat down and worked very hard! I could turn out a mathematical drawing if you'd like, but I could never do it off me own backside, I always have to just— do that, you know?

  PAUL
  Yeah.

  JOHN
  I mean—

  PAUL
  (quiet, recognizing himself)
  Yeah. Yeah. I'm onto the same thing, you know. That's— that's— we're all at that. It is only, like, if you can just remember that we're— you know. That the four of us are trying to do that. Because I mean, all of those things you say, you know, in some way, apply to me. Not all ways—

  JOHN
  Yes, yes, because everything applies a little bit to you, too.

  PAUL
  —it is just you saying it. They're all— you know, in some way, to some degree, will apply to me.

  JOHN
  (the pattern repeating)
  'Cause once there was a period where none of us could actually, uh, say anything, about your criticisms.

  PAUL
  (quiet)
  Yeah. Yeah.

  JOHN
  (bleak)
  'Cause you would reject it all.

  PAUL
  (accepting it)
  Yeah, sure.

  JOHN
  And so George and I would just go— you know, 'I'll give you a line here,' 'Okay,' you know, 'We'll do four in a bar, and I'll do...' And a lot of the times you were right.

  PAUL
  Yeah.

  JOHN
  But a lot of the times you were— the same as they always are. But I can't see the answer to that.

  PAUL
  (trying to find the silver lining)
  No, but— no, that's good you see. The thing is, like, within each other, within ourselves, we reach something that's nearly perfect. And everyone else who's listening will think, 'That's it. They've got it.' You know— you know what I mean. So okay, we know we nearly made it, but we've really made it, for everyone else.

He's building momentum, trying to convince himself as much as John.

  PAUL (CONT'D)
  'Cause it's okay, we're into the fine, finest, finest technicalities— I mean, that's where it's at, you know. If one day, we can even keep all— if all the people who are listening to this, nearly nearly made it, they'll think we've made it, you know. They'll think that's it.

  JOHN
  (bringing it back to George)
  You see, the point is now— George— is we both did that to George, this time.

  PAUL
  Mm.

  JOHN
  And because of the build up to it, that— now he can't even take that.

  PAUL
  (the harsh truth)
  Treating him a bit like a mongrel, yeah.

  JOHN
  He can't even— you know. It's like if I say, 'Alright, take it,' he'll say, 'Well, look, I can't take it. I'll forget it.'

  PAUL
  Yeah...

  JOHN
  I have to, uh—

  PAUL
  'Cause he knows what we're all about.

  JOHN
  Yeah.

  PAUL
  So he knows that when we say, 'Take it,' we expect doo-doo-duh-duh-doo. If I said that, then you'd expect—

  JOHN
  But it's just that bit. The bit where we've— 'I've Got A Feeling'.

  PAUL
  Yeah.

  JOHN
  We— there's no way we could have translated it to him, to say... you know.

They sit in silence for a moment. The conversation has circled through their entire creative partnership - the power dynamics, the egos, the unspoken expectations, the way they've treated George.

They understand the problem completely. But understanding it doesn't solve it.

The hidden microphone in the flowerpot captures it all - two friends who built something extraordinary together, now trapped in the very system they created.

FADE TO BLACK.
