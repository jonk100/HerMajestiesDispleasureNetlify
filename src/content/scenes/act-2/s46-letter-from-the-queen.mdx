notes: "This is Nigel's masterstroke. Paul's internal monologue connecting the letter to 'Klaus' is crucial. The scene's power comes from the audience knowing he's completely wrong."

t-FADE IN:

s-INT. PAUL MCCARTNEY'S HOME, CAVENDISH AVENUE - DAY (NOVEMBER 1969)

a-A sanctuary of curated calm. Sunlight streams into the living room, illuminating a space that is both a creative workshop and a family haven. A grand piano sits in the corner. Guitars are on stands. The room is tidy, warm, domestic.

a-PAUL MCCARTNEY (27) sits on a plush sofa, strumming a gentle, unformed melody on an acoustic guitar. He looks relaxed, a rare moment of peace.

a-LINDA EASTMAN (28), camera around her neck, smiles as she watches him. Their young daughter, HEATHER, plays quietly on the floor with wooden blocks.

c-LINDA
d-That's a nice one. What is it?

c-PAUL
p-(Shrugs, smiling)
d-Don't know yet. It's just... there.

a-The gentle CLATTER of the letterbox flap breaks the quiet.

c-LINDA
d-Post is here.

a-She gets up and retrieves a small stack of mail from the floor. She flips through it. Bills, fan mail... and one other.

c-LINDA (CONT'D)
d-Oh. This one looks important.

a-She hands him a thick, cream-colored envelope. It bears a royal crest, embossed in gold. It's addressed simply to "P. McCartney, Esq."

a-Paul puts his guitar aside. He takes the envelope, a flicker of curiosity on his face. He studies the crest.

c-PAUL
d-Blimey. What's this then?

a-He carefully breaks the wax seal with his thumbnail and pulls out a single sheet of heavy, watermarked paper.

a-He reads. His eyes widen. A slow, incredulous smile spreads across his face. He looks up at Linda, completely stunned.

c-PAUL (CONT'D)
d-You're not going to believe this.

c-LINDA
d-What is it?

c-PAUL
p-(Reading aloud, his voice a mix of awe and disbelief)
d-"...Her Majesty the Queen has been graciously pleased to approve the recommendation that you be appointed a Knight Bachelor... for your services to music..."

a-He lets the letter fall to his lap, shaking his head.

c-PAUL (CONT'D)
d-A knighthood. They want to make me a knight.

a-Linda's face breaks into a huge, delighted grin. She throws her arms around him.

c-LINDA
d-Paul, that's incredible! Sir Paul! Oh, my God!

a-Paul laughs, a genuine, joyful sound. He hugs her back tightly. For a moment, he is purely happy. The honor, the recognition. His dad would have been so proud.

c-PAUL
d-"Arise, Sir Paul..."
p-(He chuckles)
d-Can you believe it?

a-He picks up the letter again, re-reading it. The smile on his face slowly begins to fade. The joy is replaced by a creeping puzzlement.

c-PAUL (CONT'D)
p-(More to himself)
d-But... why? Why now?

c-LINDA
d-What do you mean, 'why'? Because you're a genius! You deserve it.

c-PAUL
d-No, I mean... the timing. The band's a mess. John's... well, he's John. It feels... odd.

a-His mind starts to race. The warm, safe room suddenly feels colder.

t-QUICK FLASHBACK - INT. INDICA GALLERY - DAY (1968)

a-A subjective memory. Paul's POV. He sees YOKO across the gallery. She's in deep, intense conversation with KLAUS (CLIVE). The audio is distorted, muffled. Klaus leans in, his gestures sharp, conspiratorial. It doesn't look like a chat about art. It looks like a briefing.

t-BACK TO SCENE

a-Paul's expression has hardened. The pieces are clicking into place in his mind, but they're all the wrong pieces.

c-PAUL
d-That German bloke. At Yoko's gallery.

c-LINDA
d-The art critic? Klaus?

c-PAUL
d-He wasn't a critic. He was something else. They've been meeting. Whispering. And now this...
p-(He holds up the letter as if it's evidence)
d-...this arrives.

a-Linda looks at him, completely lost.

c-LINDA
d-Paul, what are you talking about? This is a good thing.

c-PAUL
p-(Shaking his head, his voice low and urgent)
d-Don't you see? It's not a reward, Linda. It's a weapon.

a-He stands up, pacing the room. His sanctuary has been violated.

c-PAUL (CONT'D)
d-They're trying to split us. It's her. She's got her hooks in him, turning him against everything we were. And now the establishment... they're helping her.

a-His paranoia is now a torrent.

c-PAUL (CONT'D)
d-They make him the revolutionary clown, the one who's gone mad. And me? They make me 'Sir Paul'. The good one. The safe one. The one who plays by the rules. It drives a wedge right down the middle of us.

a-He stops pacing and looks at the letter in his hand with utter disgust. The honor has become a brand, a mark of treason against his friend.

c-PAUL (CONT'D)
p-(Quietly, fiercely)
d-They are not taking him from me.

a-He crushes the letter slightly in his fist. The melody he was strumming is forgotten. The domestic peace is shattered.

a-Linda watches him, her face a mask of worry. She sees a man she loves retreating into a world of suspicion she cannot enter.

t-FADE OUT.
