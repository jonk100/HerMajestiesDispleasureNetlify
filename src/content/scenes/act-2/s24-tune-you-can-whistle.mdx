s-INT.PAUL MCCARTNEY’S HOUSE (CAVENDISH AVENUE) – DAY

a-The music room. Tasteful. Ordered. A deliberate contrast to John’s chaotic library.
a-PAUL sits on a sofa, strumming an acoustic guitar.
a-He plays a beautiful melodic fragment of “Here, There and Everywhere.” Soft. Sweet. Effortless.

a-NIGEL FINCH is bent over an upright piano.
a-He wears blue coveralls embroidered: “B&H PIANO SERVICES.”
a-He strikes a key.

a-PING.

a-He tightens a string.

a-PING.

a-Paul stops playing.

c-PAUL
d-Sounding better?

c-NIGEL
p-(thick, working-class Cockney accent)
d-Getting there, Mr. McCartney. Getting there. Lovely tune that.

a-Paul brightens despite himself.

c-PAUL
d-You think? Bit soft, maybe?

c-NIGEL
d-Nah. That’s what people want, isn’t it? A nice tune. Something you can whistle to while the kettle boils.

a-Nigel deliberately hits a discordant note.

a-PING.

c-NIGEL
d-Not like that other racket.

a-Paul pauses.

c-PAUL
d-What other racket?

c-NIGEL
d-Oh, you know. The radio. Some of the new stuff coming out.
p-(like he's trying not to gossip)
d-And all this talk about your mate and... Jesus.
p-(a shrug)
d-My wife says it’s in the papers now.

a-Paul goes still.

c-PAUL
p-(careful)
d-What’s in the papers?

c-NIGEL
p-(a quick, dismissive wave)
d-Ah, nothing. Just a quote. They always pick a quote.
p-(then, as if remembering)
d-And that last record… what was it? The one with the sitar?

c-PAUL
d-“Norwegian Wood.”

c-NIGEL
d-That’s the badger. Gave me a headache, tell you the truth. No offense, sir. Just… a bloke gets home from work, he doesn’t want to be educated, does he? He wants to be cheered up.

a-Paul absorbs this. His smile fades.
a-This is his deepest fear, unspoken until now.

c-PAUL
d-John—my mate—he thinks we need to challenge people. Shake them up a bit.

a-Nigel shakes his head sadly, like a mechanic diagnosing a terminal fault.

c-NIGEL
d-Shake them up? Sir, the world’s scary enough. If I may be bold… you’re the one holding it together. The heart of it.

a-Paul stiffens.

c-NIGEL
d-If you let the other one turn it all into noise… well… they’ll stop loving you, won’t they?

a-The words land cleanly. Surgically.
a-They’ll stop loving you.

a-Nigel returns to tuning.

a-PING. Perfect pitch.

a-He packs his tools.

c-NIGEL
d-Stick to the love songs, Mr. McCartney. That’s what keeps the lights on.

a-Nigel exits.

a-Paul remains seated in the sudden silence.
a-He looks down at his guitar.
a-He plays a single chord.

a-It sounds lonely.

a-He picks up a pen and scribbles aggressively on a lyric sheet, crossing out a stranger, more abstract line.
a-He writes instead:

a-“I need my love to be here.”
