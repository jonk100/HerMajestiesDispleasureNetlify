SCENE START

The Klaus Methodology

FADE IN:

INT. ROBERT FRASER GALLERY - DAY (JULY 1968)

A stark, minimalist gallery space. White walls, polished floors. The gallery is crowded but quiet. The main attraction is a large, circular, completely white canvas. In the center, in tiny letters, are the words "you are here". In front of it sits a white charity collection tin.

YOKO ONO (35) stands serenely near the piece. Her public relationship with John has made her a figure of intense fascination and controversy.

Enter CLIVE BARROW (44), transformed into his "KLAUS" persona. He wears a black turtleneck, dark slacks, and an absurdly tilted black beret. He approaches the white canvas with exaggerated intensity, circling it, squinting.

  CLIVE
  (in a terrible, inconsistent German accent)
  Fascinating. Zee void. It is a mirror, ja? Reflecting back at zee viewer nothing but zair own existential dread. Zee white... it is not an absence of color, but zee terrifying presence of all colors at once!

Yoko turns toward him with genuine interest. Someone is looking past the controversy to the concept.

  YOKO
  (serene, pleased)
  The piece is an invitation. It simply states a fact: you are here. The rest is whatever the viewer brings to it.

  CLIVE
  (nodding vigorously, his accent slipping)
  Ja, exactly! Zee participation! You are asking not for interpretation, but for... for presence! It is a critique of art as object, and a celebration of art as... as a moment in consciousness! Sehr sophisticated!

He adjusts his beret, which has shifted precariously.

  CLIVE (CONT'D)
  (gesturing at the collection tin)
  And zis! A stroke of genius! A commentary on zee commodification of zee spiritual journey! You invite us to confront zee void, and zen you ask for... for loose change! It is... it is a devastating parody of capitalist salvation!

Yoko's eyes light up. This strange European critic understands conceptual art's playful provocations.

  YOKO
  (genuinely engaged)
  Or perhaps it is simply a chance to do something good while you are here.

  CLIVE
  (scribbling frantically in his notebook)
  Ah, zeh duality! Zis is vy your vork transcends zee... zee bourgeois limitations of traditional art forms. You are not just making objects, you are... you are creating experiences of consciousness itself!

His accent wavers between German, vaguely Eastern European, and occasionally slips into pure English before he catches himself.

Across the gallery, PAUL MCCARTNEY (26) enters quietly, looking around with the cautious air of someone out of his element. He spots Yoko in deep conversation with the intense, foreign-looking stranger and moves closer, staying partially hidden behind a large abstract sculpture.

  YOKO
  (to Clive, warming to the discussion)
  Most people see my work and think it's empty or meaningless. But you understand that the meaning comes from the interaction, the participation.

  CLIVE
  (leaning in conspiratorially, his voice dropping)
  Perhaps... perhaps z'are others who vould benefit from understanding zis philosophy, ja? Zose who are... trapped in more conventional forms of expression?

Paul's eyes narrow. He can't hear the words clearly, but the body language looks suspicious — the foreigner leaning in, speaking quietly, Yoko listening intently.

  YOKO
  (thoughtfully)
  Art should dissolve boundaries. Between performer and audience, between artist and subject. When John and I work together, we try to break down those artificial separations.

  CLIVE
  (his eyes lighting up with what he believes is recruitment opportunity)
  Ah, John! Your... your collaborator. He must be very... vhat is zee vord... receptive to new ideas, ja? New vays of seeing zee vorld?

  YOKO
  (simply)
  I hope to see everything differently than I did yesterday. John does, too. We both do.

Paul watches as Clive pulls out a business card and hands it to Yoko with a slight bow. Even from across the room, Paul can see it's some kind of formal exchange.

  CLIVE
  (straightening his beret one final time)
  I vould very much like to write about your vork for zee European art journals. Perhaps vee could... how you say... continue zis conversation at another time?

  YOKO
  (taking the card graciously)
  I'd like that. It's rare to meet someone who truly understands conceptual art.

  CLIVE
  (bowing slightly, his accent thick again)
  Zee pleasure is entirely mine, Fraulein Ono. Your vork... it vill change zee vorld, I am certain of zis.

He backs away with another theatrical bow, nearly tripping over his own feet. As he exits, he adjusts his beret one last time and disappears into the London street.

Paul emerges from behind the sculpture, his expression dark with suspicion. He approaches Yoko, who is still looking at the business card with mild interest.

  PAUL
  (trying to sound casual)
  Friend of yours?

  YOKO
  (looking up, surprised to see him)
  Paul. I didn't know you were here.

  PAUL
  (gesturing toward the exit)
  That bloke you were talking to. Seemed... intense.

  YOKO
  (serenely)
  Klaus. He's a German art critic. Very knowledgeable about conceptual work.

  PAUL
  (his suspicion growing)
  German, eh? What did he want?

  YOKO
  (simply)
  To understand the art. To write about it.

Paul looks at the business card in her hand, then back toward the gallery entrance where Clive disappeared. His expression hardens with a mixture of protectiveness and paranoia.

  PAUL
  (quietly, more to himself)
  Right. Art critic.

Yoko returns her attention to her installation, completely unaware of Paul's growing suspicion. She places Klaus's business card in her small purse with the same serene care she gives to everything else.

The gallery's white walls seem to close in slightly, the sterile space suddenly feeling less like a temple to art and more like a stage for unseen dramas. Paul continues to stare at the exit, his mind racing with possibilities, all of them wrong.
