s-INT. MI5 OFFICE - DAY (APRIL 1966)

a-A cramped, soul-crushing office space. Harsh fluorescent lighting casts everything in an unflattering pallor. Beige filing cabinets line the walls. A single window looks out onto a brick wall.

a-CLIVE BARROW (42) sits at a cluttered desk, pecking away at an ancient typewriter with the intensity of a concert pianist. His desk is a monument to bureaucratic chaos - surveillance photos (mostly blurry), carbon paper, and an overflowing ashtray next to a cold cup of tea.

a-He pauses, studies his work with the satisfaction of a master craftsman, then continues typing. The CLACKING of keys echoes in the sterile room.

a-CLOSE-UP on the typewriter. We see fragments of text being typed: "...as a concerned Christian and longtime reader of your publication, I was deeply troubled by recent comments made by John Lennon of The Beatles regarding our Lord and Savior..."

a-Clive stops typing. He leans back in his chair, which squeaks ominously, and reads his work with the reverence of a poet reviewing his masterpiece.

c-CLIVE
p-(to himself, theatrical whisper)
d-Psychological ricochet... in motion.

a-He rolls the paper out of the typewriter with a flourish. The letterhead reads "Mrs. Gladys Pemberton, Birmingham, Alabama."

a-On his desk lies a massive stack of envelopes, already sealed. We see the top one - addressed in neat block letters to "DATEBOOK Magazine, New York, NY". Clive folds his newly typed "Gladys Pemberton" letter, slides it into an envelope addressed to "The Alabama Baptist Herald, Attn: Letters to the Editor."

a-He seals it and opens his desk drawer, revealing a collection of stamps from various countries - his tools for international manipulation. He selects an American stamp with the care of a surgeon choosing an instrument.

a-EXTREME CLOSE-UP: Clive's tongue as he licks the stamp. The camera pulls back slowly and we see his eyes closed in what can only be described as sensual satisfaction.

a-He attaches the stamp to the letter, places it on top of the Datebook letter and takes a deep breath - examining the pile of letters and envelopes like a general reviewing his troops before battle.

c-CLIVE
d-And... scene.

a-He places the pile of letters in a wire basket labeled "OUTGOING POST" with the reverence of placing a wreath on a war memorial.

a-A beat.
a-The fluorescent light BUZZES.

a-Then Clive does something almost tender.
a-He straightens the basket label so it sits perfectly level.

c-CLIVE
p-(quietly, almost sincere)
d-Speak, my little choir.

a-He returns to his typewriter.
a-Inserts a fresh sheet.
a-Not a letter this time.

a-Types a heading:
a-"OPERATION MINUET — PUBLIC TEMPERATURE." 

a-Under it, a line:
a-"THE PRESS WILL DO THE WORK FOR US." 

a-He underlines it twice.

t-CUT TO:

s-INT. BUCKINGHAM PALACE – STUDY – DAY

a-A room built for certainty.
a-Books with matching spines.
a-Polished wood.
a-A quiet ticking clock that sounds like a verdict.

a-PRINCE PHILLIP sits behind a desk, newspaper opened like a battle map.
a-Not the front page.
a-The middle.
a-The part that pretends to be calm.

a-CLOSE on a small column:
a-"LETTERS TO THE EDITOR." 

a-Philip reads.
a-His face is still.
a-His pleasure is almost clinical.

c-PHILLIP
p-(reading)
d-"As a concerned Christian and lifelong reader, I was appalled to see a pop singer place himself above Our Lord..."

a-He turns the page, finds another.

c-PHILLIP (CONT'D)
p-(reading)
d-"What example does this set for our youth? If Mr. Lennon has no respect for the Church, he has no respect for the Crown..."

a-That one lands.
a-Philip’s eyes narrow—then soften.

a-He reaches to a side table.
a-A thin folder stamped:
a-"MINUET — CULTURAL MONITORING." 

a-Inside: a clipped copy of a foreign headline.
a-Underlined.
a-Handled too often.

a-Philip slides today’s newspaper atop it.
a-A new layer.
a-A new proof.

c-PHILLIP
p-(to himself)
d-There we are.

a-A KNOCK.
a-A PRIVATE SECRETARY appears in the doorway, hesitant.

c-SECRETARY
p-(careful)
d-Sir?

c-PHILLIP
p-(without looking up)
d-Yes.

c-SECRETARY
d-The Prime Minister’s office called again.
p-(beat)
d-They’re asking whether this—
p-(searching)
d-Beatles matter—requires any… formal response.

a-Philip finally looks up.
a-A man enjoying the first click of a machine he’s ordered built.

c-PHILLIP
d-Formal response?

a-He taps the "Letters" column with one finger.

c-PHILLIP (CONT'D)
d-This is the response.
p-(a pause, almost satisfied)
d-The country is speaking.

a-The secretary nods, doesn’t understand, retreats.

a-Philip returns to the paper.
a-Another letter.
a-Another voice.
a-None of them real.

t-CUT TO BLACK.
