s-INT. MI5 SURVEILLANCE VAN – NIGHT

a-Nigel sits alone. Rain taps the roof.
a-The van smells faintly of damp wool and instant coffee.

a-He listens through headphones, for nothing in particular.
a-Static.
a-A kettle boiling somewhere.
a-A laugh in the distance.

a-He checks his watch, then removes the headphones and opens a notebook.
a-He does it like a ritual.
a-He writes:

a-“SUBJECT: LENNON”
a-Then he underlines it once, regretting the drama of the underline, and stops.

a-He pauses, puts the headphones back on.
a-Listens.
a-Stares out through the window, at nothing in particular.

a-He taps his pen against the notebook.
a-Three taps. Stops. Three taps. Stops.

a-A young couple walks past, laughing. Nigel watches them go.
a-He watches like they’re evidence of something he can’t file.

a-He takes the headphones off again, hangs them on the rear-view mirror, and turns the radio on.

a-The Beatles play.
a-He listens. Not with suspicion — with something more like doubt.

a-He checks his watch again, then looks down at the notebook.
a-He’s doodled a picture of a sad man in a suit in the bottom corner of the page. The suit has a tie. The tie has been shaded in.

a-He quickly scribbles it out as if it might be discoverable in court.
a-He continues below the header, smaller:

a-"NO ACTION REQUIRED."
a-He stares at the sentence.
a-It doesn’t feel like a conclusion. It feels like a wish.

a-He taps his pen against the notebook a few more times before adding:

a-"YET."

a-Outside, somewhere beyond the rain, the song reaches its chorus.
a-Nigel sits very still, listening as if the music might confess to something.
a-It doesn’t.
a-That’s the problem.
