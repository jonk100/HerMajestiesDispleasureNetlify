t-FADE IN:

s-INT. TWICKENHAM FILM STUDIOS - DAY (JANUARY 1969)

a-The harsh fluorescent lights buzz overhead, casting everything in a sickly, institutional glow. This is the polar opposite of Abbey Road's warm creativity - concrete floors, industrial equipment, and cameras positioned like silent judges throughout the space.

a-The Beatles' equipment sits in the center like an island of abandoned hope. Amplifiers, drums, guitars - all the tools of their former magic, now looking somehow smaller and sadder in this sterile environment.

a-JOHN LENNON, 28, sits at the piano, but he's not playing. His hair is longer, wilder, his clothes more casual and unkempt. Next to him, YOKO ONO, 36, sits in a chair that clearly wasn't meant for her - an intrusion into the sacred Beatles space that would have been unthinkable three years ago.

a-PAUL MCCARTNEY, 26, paces near his bass, trying to generate energy that simply isn't there. His usual diplomatic charm is strained, forced.

a-GEORGE HARRISON, 25, sits cross-legged on the floor with his sitar, but he's not playing Indian music. He's just... sitting. Detached. His spiritual seeking has become spiritual withdrawal.

a-RINGO STARR, 28, sits behind his drum kit like a man at his own funeral.

a-The cameras roll silently, documenting the death of a dream.

c-PAUL
p-(with forced enthusiasm)
d-Right then. Shall we try "Two of Us" again? I think we were getting somewhere yesterday.

a-No one moves. John doesn't even look up from the piano keys.

c-JOHN
p-(flatly)
d-Were we?

c-PAUL
p-(trying to maintain momentum)
d-Yes, I think so. The harmony in the bridge was starting to work, and if we just...

c-JOHN
p-(interrupting, still not looking up)
d-Paul, do you ever listen to yourself? "Starting to work." "If we just." Always conditional with you, isn't it?

a-YOKO shifts slightly in her chair, a small movement that somehow draws everyone's attention. Her presence is like a stone thrown into still water - the ripples are invisible but felt by everyone.

c-PAUL
p-(tension creeping in)
d-I'm trying to be constructive, John.

c-JOHN
p-(finally looking up, cold)
d-Are you? Or are you trying to be in charge?

a-The silence that follows is deafening. George continues to stare at his sitar strings. Ringo examines his drumsticks as if he's never seen them before.

c-GEORGE
p-(quietly, without looking up)
d-Maybe we should just... not. Today.

c-PAUL
p-(frustrated)
d-George, we've got a deadline. We've got cameras rolling. We've got...

c-GEORGE
p-(still quiet, but with an edge)
d-We've got nothing, Paul. Can't you see that?

a-He finally looks up, and there's something broken in his eyes.

c-GEORGE (CONT'D)
d-We're sitting in this... this factory, pretending we're still a band. But we're not, are we? We're just four people who used to know each other.

c-RINGO
p-(softly)
d-Maybe we should take a break.

c-PAUL
p-(desperately)
d-We can't keep taking breaks! We need to make music. That's what we do. That's who we are.

c-JOHN
p-(with bitter amusement)
d-Is it? When's the last time you felt anything when we played together, Paul? Really felt it?

a-Paul opens his mouth to answer, then closes it. The question hangs in the air like an accusation.

c-YOKO
p-(speaking for the first time, her voice calm and measured)
d-Perhaps the music is trying to tell you something.

a-All eyes turn to her. The fact that she's spoken at all feels like a violation of some unspoken rule.

c-YOKO (CONT'D)
p-(to John, gently)
d-Art should flow from truth, not obligation.

c-PAUL
p-(barely controlled anger)
d-This isn't about art, it's about...

c-JOHN
p-(cutting him off)
d-About what, Paul? About keeping the machine running? About not disappointing the fans? About protecting the brand?

a-He stands up from the piano, walks away from it.

c-JOHN (CONT'D)
d-Maybe Yoko's right. Maybe the music is trying to tell us something. Maybe it's trying to tell us it's over.

c-PAUL
p-(desperate now)
d-It doesn't have to be over! We just need to remember why we started doing this. The joy of it. The...

c-GEORGE
p-(interrupting, standing up)
d-The joy?

a-He looks around the sterile studio, at the cameras, at the industrial lighting.

c-GEORGE (CONT'D)
d-Paul, look around. Does this look like joy to you?

a-He gestures at the space, at their positions - John and Yoko on one side, Paul isolated, George detached, Ringo trying to disappear.

c-GEORGE (CONT'D)
d-We're not making music anymore. We're performing an autopsy.

a-The cameras continue to roll, capturing every moment of dissolution. The silence stretches until it becomes unbearable.

c-RINGO
p-(finally speaking, his voice heavy)
d-You know what the worst part is?

a-Everyone looks at him.

c-RINGO (CONT'D)
d-We used to laugh. Remember? We used to laugh all the time. Even when things were mental, even when we were exhausted, we'd find something funny.

a-He looks around at his bandmates.

c-RINGO (CONT'D)
d-When's the last time we laughed together?

a-The question hangs in the air. No one has an answer.

c-PAUL
p-(quietly, defeated)
d-We could... we could try again tomorrow.

c-JOHN
p-(shaking his head)
d-No, Paul. Tomorrow will be the same as today. And the day after that. And the day after that.

a-He walks toward the exit, Yoko rising to follow him.

c-JOHN (CONT'D)
p-(pausing at the door)
d-You want to know the truth? The Beatles died somewhere between the Cavern Club and here. We've just been playing the corpse for the cameras.

a-He exits with Yoko. The remaining three sit in the harsh fluorescent light, surrounded by their instruments and their memories.

c-GEORGE
p-(after a long pause)
d-He's not wrong, is he?

c-PAUL
p-(barely audible)
d-No. He's not wrong.

a-The cameras continue to roll, documenting the end of the most successful band in history. But there's no drama in it, no explosive argument or dramatic walkout. Just four friends who can no longer find their way back to each other.

a-RINGO picks up his drumsticks, taps them together once, then sets them down again.

c-RINGO
p-(to no one in particular)
d-It was good while it lasted, though. Wasn't it?

a-PAUL and GEORGE look at him, then at each other. For just a moment, there's a flicker of the old connection, the old understanding.

c-PAUL
p-(with a sad smile)
d-Yeah, Ringo. It was good.

a-The camera slowly pulls back, showing the three remaining Beatles dwarfed by the industrial space, their instruments silent, their magic spent.

t-FADE TO BLACK.
