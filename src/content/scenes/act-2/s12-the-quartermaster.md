SCENE START

INT. MI5 Q-BRANCH - DAY (EARLY 1966)

A cavernous, chilly storeroom in the bowels of Whitehall. Fluorescent lights hum over rows of grey metal shelving, meticulously labeled but covered in a fine layer of dust. The air smells of ozone and old Bakelite. This is where spy technology comes to die.

PERCY DALTON (57), a wiry man in a brown cardigan and thick glasses, stands behind a long counter, polishing a hefty piece of Cold War-era equipment with a soft cloth. He is the obsessive gatekeeper of this forgotten kingdom.

NIGEL FINCH (49) and CLIVE BARROW (42) approach the counter. Nigel carries a clipboard with a requisition form. Clive practically vibrates with excitement.

  CLIVE
  Morning, Percy! We require some kit for a... delicate undertaking. Audio surveillance. I was thinking something discreet. A miniature sonic amplifier, perhaps? Something state-of-the-art.

Percy stops polishing. He looks slowly up from the device, over the top of his glasses. The look is one of profound, ancient weariness.

  PERCY
  (Clipped, irritated)
  Form 12-C. In triplicate.

Nigel slides a perfectly completed form across the counter. Percy picks it up, inspects it with suspicion, then grunts.

  PERCY (CONT'D)
  "Miniature."
  (He scoffs)
  This isn't a bloody Bond film, Barrow. This is His Majesty's government. We have standards. And budgets.

He turns and disappears into the aisles. After a moment of rummaging, he returns, placing a heavy, metal box on the counter with a loud THUD. It looks like a car battery with a large cone attached to it.

  PERCY (CONT'D)
  Item 47-B. Parabolic Listening Device. German. 1953. Very reliable.

  CLIVE
  (Deflated)
  Right. And... how does one conceal that? In a bread van?

  PERCY
  (Ignoring him)
  Battery life is approximately ninety minutes, provided you don't use it in the damp. The last agent who used this in the damp, a chap in Budapest, caused a short. Do you know what a replacement valve costs for a '53 Telefunken?

Nigel sighs, a sound of pure existential despair.

  NIGEL
  Go on then, Percy.

  PERCY
  Fourteen pounds and sixpence! A month's wages for some people. And he didn't return it in the original packaging. Had to fill out a Form 21-A for non-compliance. Truly dreadful business.

Percy hands Clive a tangle of wires and a pair of enormous headphones.

  PERCY (CONT'D)
  Now, you lose a single one of these transmitter screws, and that comes out of your travel stipend. I'm not joking. I'll be checking the manifest upon return.

  CLIVE
  (Desperately)
  We're conducting a psychological ricochet operation against a major cultural target! We can't do it with a museum piece!

  PERCY
  You can do it with what you're given, Barrow. Just like everyone else. Sign here. And here. Initial there.

He pushes the clipboard toward Clive. Nigel is already walking away, having accepted their fate.

  NIGEL
  (Over his shoulder)
  Don't forget the original packaging, Clive.

Percy watches them go, then returns to polishing his device, the guardian of mediocrity, utterly content in his perfectly ordered, perfectly useless world.
