SCENE START

A More Theatrical Approach

FADE IN:

INT. BUCKINGHAM PALACE PRIVATE STUDY - DAY (LATE 1966)

The masculine sanctuary of dark wood and leather. PRINCE PHILIP (45) stands impatiently by the window. LORD MOUNTBATTEN (66) sits at a large desk, reviewing a file. The air is thick with serious purpose.

The door opens and PRINCESS MARGARET (36) sweeps in, holding a long cigarette holder and radiating an aura of magnificent boredom.

  PRINCESS MARGARET
  Dickie. Philip. Still huddled over your little pop group? Honestly, the country is falling to bits and you two are fretting over four boys who look like they've wandered out of a train station cafeteria.

Mountbatten doesn't look up.

  MOUNTBATTEN
  Your Royal Highness. We were just reviewing the successful amplification of the... "Jesus" affair.

Margaret exhales a plume of smoke — amused, contemptuous.

  PRINCESS MARGARET
  Oh, that business. Terribly dreary. Americans screaming scripture at Liverpudlians.
  (shrugs)
  It's like tossing pearls into a crowd and hoping someone downmarket catches them.

Philip turns, irritation rising.

  PRINCE PHILIP
  This is a matter of national dignity, Margaret, not a West End show.

Margaret smirks.

  PRINCESS MARGARET
  My dear Philip — the monarchy is a show. We simply pretend it isn't. You should try it sometime.

She saunters to the desk, picks up a file as though it might be contagious.

  PRINCESS MARGARET (CONT'D)
  You're all obsessed with the angry one. But you're missing the opportunity sitting right under your perfectly shaped noses. The other one — the agreeable, eager little puppy dog.

Mountbatten looks up.

  MOUNTBATTEN
  McCartney? A comformist. Hardly a threat.

He waves a hand dismissively, but Margaret laughs — low and wicked.

  PRINCESS MARGARET
  Exactly. A conformist is a creature of appetite. Praise, status, approval... dangle a bit of refinement and they'll crawl straight toward it.
  (taps ash elegantly)
  Someone at dinner last week was cooing about his new film score. Very proud of himself, apparently. It was all so frightfully provincial. You could almost smell the factory soot.

Philip scoffs.

  PHILIP
  A film score? He's convinced himself he's a real composer now?

  PRINCESS MARGARET
  It's sweet, really. They want so badly to be embraced by the very world they insist they're rebelling against.
  (tilts her head)
  Why not give him the embrace he's desperate for? Have one of your little well-trained men at the Times write a glowing review. Praise his "masterful orchestration." Compare him to Noël Coward. Use words like "sophisticated" and "mature".

Mountbatten's eyebrow lifts. Now she has him.

  MOUNTBATTEN
  You're suggesting we weaponize his ambition.

  PRINCESS MARGARET
  I'm suggesting we encourage the delusion. Give him everything he thinks he deserves.
  (she takes a long drag from her cigarette)
  Call his little composition "astonishingly sophisticated." Say he shows "the promise of a composer of real breeding."

She lets that sink in for a beat.

  PRINCESS MARGARET (CONT'D)
  Imagine how Lennon will respond when his partner becomes the establishment's new pet. That sort of jealousy is practically ethnic to the northern temperament.

Philip's eyes flick upward at her phrasing — shocked, but amused.

  PRINCE PHILIP
  Quite vicious, Margaret, even for you.

  PRINCESS MARGARET
  (pleasantly)
  I'm doing my part for Crown and country, Philip. Sometimes all one requires is vanity and a match.

She glides toward the door.

  PRINCESS MARGARET (CONT'D)
  Now if you'll excuse me, all this national service has left me parched.

She exits in a sweep of smoke and silk as Philip and Mountbatten exchange a look.

  MOUNTBATTEN
  I'll have Finchley assign a cultural asset at the Sunday papers.

  PRINCE PHILIP
  (quiet, calculating)
  See that you do.
