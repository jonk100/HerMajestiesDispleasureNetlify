t-FADE IN:

s-INT. TWICKENHAM FILM STUDIOS - DAY

a-Another tense moment. JOHN and PAUL are arguing about arrangement again. GEORGE is silent, withdrawn. The music has stopped.

c-PAUL
p-(frustrated)
d-We're getting nowhere! We've been at this for hours and nothing's working.

c-JOHN
p-(sarcastic)
d-Maybe we should all go home and come back when we can actually play.

a-RINGO speaks up, his voice calm and reasonable. This is the early episode version - the peacekeeper trying to hold things together.

c-RINGO
p-(gently)
d-We always do this. We always struggle at the beginning and then we get there. Just give it time.

a-PAUL sighs, nods. Even JOHN seems to relax a bit. RINGO's simple statement of truth cuts through the tension.

c-GEORGE
p-(quietly)
d-Right.

a-They pick up their instruments. For a moment, it might work.

t-CUT TO:

s-INT. TWICKENHAM FILM STUDIOS - LATER

a-The same situation, but worse. The argument is more bitter. GEORGE is barely present. The air is thick with resignation.

c-PAUL
p-(desperate)
d-I don't understand why this is so hard! We used to be able to do this in our sleep!

c-JOHN
p-(coldly)
d-Maybe we're not the same people anymore.

a-RINGO speaks again. Same tone, same words. But the meaning has completely changed.

c-RINGO
p-(quietly)
d-We always do this.

a-This time it's not reassurance. It's a statement of fact. This is what they do now. This is who they've become.

a-No one responds. There's nothing to say. The repetition does the work.

c-RINGO
p-(after a beat)
d-We always do this.

a-He looks around at the others. PAUL looks defeated. JOHN looks angry. GEORGE looks like he's already left.

a-RINGO picks up his drumsticks. He doesn't say anything else. He just waits. The canary has stopped singing.

t-FADE OUT.
