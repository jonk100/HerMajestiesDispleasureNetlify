s-INT. BUCKINGHAM PALACE – PRIVATE SITTING ROOM – EVENING

a-A quiet, orderly room. No clutter. No softness. Everything is placed, not lived in.

a-PRINCE PHILIP (46) stands by a sideboard, pouring himself a drink with naval precision.

a-On a small wireless radio across the room, a BBC announcer fades out.

c-BBC ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
d-—and in other news, Mr. John Lennon of The Beatles has offered further remarks this week on religion and modern life, prompting the usual columnists to clear their throats.

a-MUSIC fades in.

a-It’s The Beatles. Mid-period. Harmonies layered, slightly strange. Not aggressive. Not polite either.

a-Philip freezes. He listens.

a-Not with curiosity — with assessment.

a-He crosses the room and turns the volume up a fraction. The music fills the space, clashing with the room’s perfect order.

a-A lyric drifts by. Oblique. Abstract. Earnest in a way Philip finds immediately suspect.

a-Philip frowns.

c-PRINCE PHILIP
d-What is this supposed to be?

a-He listens longer. A chord change surprises him. He doesn’t like that it does.

a-The song builds — voices overlapping, refusing to resolve cleanly.

a-Philip exhales sharply through his nose.

c-PRINCE PHILIP
d-It’s just… noise.

a-He reaches out and snaps the radio off mid-phrase.

a-Sudden silence. Restored order.

a-Philip stands there for a beat, drink untouched.

a-He looks at the radio as if it has failed a basic test.

c-PRINCE PHILIP
d-No discipline.

a-He straightens his cuff, already done.

a-The verdict has been delivered. Case closed.
