t-FADE IN:

a-A SERIES OF INTERCUT SCENES, CONNECTED BY THE RINGING OF TELEPHONES AND THE HUSHED TONES OF BREAKING NEWS.

s-INT. HOTEL ROOM, BANGOR, WALES - DAY (AUGUST 27, 1967)

a-Sunlight streams into a modest hotel room. JOHN, PAUL, GEORGE, and RINGO are sitting on the floor with the MAHARISHI MAHESH YOGI. They are dressed in simple, casual clothes. The mood is calm, meditative. For the first time in years, they look like four young men at peace.

a-A hotel phone RINGS. An AIDE answers it.

s-INT. NIGEL FINCH'S OFFICE - DAY

a-Nigel sits at his neat desk, a cup of tea steaming beside him. His phone RINGS. He answers, listens, his face remaining impassive.

c-NIGEL
p-(into phone)
d-I see. Thank you.

a-He hangs up and takes a slow sip of tea. He opens a filing cabinet and pulls out a thick file folder with "EPSTEIN, B" on the tab. He places it squarely in the center of his desk, opens it, and methodically flips through the files.

a-He sets aside a complex diagram with "Brian Epstein" in the middle, surrounded by names — all four Beatles there, alongside an intricate web of producers, publishers, lawyers, promoters, financiers, and others — anyone connected to the massive network controlled by Epstein. As his eyes scan the page, Nigel's face is grim.

s-INT. HOTEL ROOM, BANGOR - DAY

a-The AIDE approaches quietly, his face pale. He approaches the group and leans down.

c-AIDE
p-(softly, carefully)
d-I'm so sorry, but there's been an accident. It's Mr. Epstein. He's gone.

a-John's reaction is sharp, visceral. He doubles over as if punched.

c-JOHN
p-(hoarse, almost to himself)
d-No... No, not Brian. Not him.

a-George and Ringo look on, their faces a mixture of confusion and horror. Paul's eyes go straight to the ground. No one moves or speaks for a moment.

a-Paul picks his head up, tears in his eyes but calm.

c-PAUL
p-(voice cracking)
d-Who's going to hold it together now? Who's going to keep us moving?

c-RINGO
p-(face in his hands, crying)
d-He looked after us. Always did.

a-George is looking through the window, studying something no one else can see.

c-GEORGE
d-The center's gone. Everything scatters now... Leaves in the wind...

a-The four Beatles are huddled together now, the Maharishi forgotten. They are no longer pop stars or spiritual seekers. They are four orphans, suddenly adrift.

a-Ringo just shakes his head, tears welling in his eyes. John looks up, his face a mask of grief and rage.

c-JOHN
p-(a raw, broken voice)
d-We're on our own now.

a-The camera pulls back, leaving them in a circle of shock and grief. The spiritual retreat has become a prison. Their protector is gone.

s-INT. BUCKINGHAM PALACE, PHILIP'S STUDY - DAY

a-Prince Philip is studying a large naval map on his desk, moving miniature ships with a long pointer. An AIDE enters quietly.

c-AIDE
d-Your Royal Highness. A telephone call from Sir Derek.

a-Philip doesn't look up from his map.

c-PRINCE PHILIP
d-What is it?

c-AIDE
d-It's about the... asset manager for the subjects. Brian Epstein. There's been an accident. He's dead.

a-Philip stops moving the ships. He remains perfectly still for a long moment. He shows no surprise, no satisfaction. Only the cold focus of a predator sensing a sudden, unexpected advantage.

a-He slowly straightens up, his eyes still on the map.

c-PRINCE PHILIP
p-(quietly, to the aide)
d-Thank you. That will be all.

a-The aide exits.

a-Philip picks up the pointer again. He looks down at the board, at the tiny ships representing his forces. He gently nudges one forward, into a now undefended position.

c-PRINCE PHILIP (CONT'D)
p-(to himself)
d-Proceed.
