t-FADE IN:

s-INT. TWICKENHAM FILM STUDIOS - DAY (JANUARY 10, 1969)

a-Morning. The soundstage feels different today - the tension has shifted from frustration to something darker. A decision is forming.

a-GEORGE HARRISON (25) is quiet. More than quiet - withdrawn. He sits with his guitar, but there's a distance in his eyes. This is a man who has made up his mind.

a-PAUL MCCARTNEY (26), JOHN LENNON (28), and RINGO STARR (28) are working on "Get Back" - trying to nail the arrangement. Paul is at the piano, enthusiastic about the song.

a-YOKO ONO (36) sits nearby, her usual silent presence.

c-PAUL
p-(excited)
d-We've just got to do something about this middle eight.

c-GEORGE
p-(distant)
d-Try shuffling it, the whole middle eight.

a-They work through it. This rehearsal is actually good - maybe the best version yet. For a moment, it feels like the old Beatles.

c-GEORGE (CONT'D)
p-(after they finish)
d-That's the best so far.

a-But there's no joy in his voice. Just observation.

s-INT. TWICKENHAM FILM STUDIOS - DINING ROOM - DAY

a-LUNCH BREAK

a-A small dining room adjoining a bar. MICHAEL LINDSAY-HOGG (30s) sits at a long table with PAUL, JOHN, YOKO, and RINGO. They're eating lunch, casual conversation about the morning's work.

a-GEORGE is not there.

a-Michael has arranged for a hidden microphone in the flower pot on the table - a documentarian's instinct that something is about to happen.

a-The conversation continues. The sound of cutlery on plates, glasses being set down. Muffled voices discussing the session.

a-Then GEORGE appears at the end of the table.

a-He's wearing a beautiful black corduroy hat. He stands there for a moment, silent. Everyone looks up at him.

c-GEORGE
p-(calm, final)
d-See you 'round the clubs.

a-That's it. No drama. No explanation. Just goodbye.

a-He turns and walks out.

a-The table sits in silence for a beat. Then JOHN's face hardens - his defensive aggression kicking in.

c-JOHN
p-(immediately)
d-Let's get in Eric. He's just as good and not such a headache.

a-Paul and Ringo don't respond. They won't be drawn into this. The suggestion hangs in the air like smoke.

s-INT. TWICKENHAM FILM STUDIOS - SOUNDSTAGE - DAY

a-AFTER LUNCH

a-Paul, John, and Ringo return to the studio. The cameras are still rolling. George's equipment sits there, abandoned.

a-YOKO now sits on the edge of the rostrum - on the blue cushion that had been George's.

c-PAUL
p-(to no one in particular)
d-I don't know why we are coming back here for.

c-JOHN
p-(flatly)
d-Just pretending nothing's happened.

a-And that's exactly what they do. They pick up their instruments.

a-What follows is not music - it's a release. A ferocious riff. Half an hour of anger and frustration expressed through guitars and drums. Paul on bass, John on guitar, Ringo pounding the drums.

a-Yoko leans into George's microphone and howls.

a-It's not The Beatles. It's something else. Something raw and broken.

t-CUT TO:

s-INT. TWICKENHAM FILM STUDIOS - LATER

a-JOHN talks with MICHAEL LINDSAY-HOGG near the cameras. The jam session is over. The studio feels empty despite the equipment.

c-JOHN
d-I think, if George doesn't come back by Monday or Tuesday, we'll ask Eric Clapton to play. Eric will be pleased... He'd have enough scope to play the guitar. The point is, George leaves and do we want to carry on The Beatles? I certainly do.

c-MICHAEL LINDSAY-HOGG
d-Maybe for the show, I mean, you could just say George was sick.

c-JOHN
p-(dismissive)
d-No. I mean, if he leaves, he leaves.

c-MICHAEL LINDSAY-HOGG
d-What's the consensus? Do you want to go on with the show and the work?

c-JOHN
d-If he doesn't come back by Tuesday, we get Clapton.

a-Michael studies him for a moment.

c-MICHAEL LINDSAY-HOGG
d-Has anyone ever left as seriously as George before?

a-John doesn't answer. He just turns away, back to the piano.

a-Across the studio, RINGO sits at his drums, not playing. Just sitting. The peacekeeper who couldn't keep the peace.

a-PAUL stands alone with his bass, looking at George's empty spot. For the first time in this whole ordeal, Paul McCartney looks lost.

a-The cameras continue rolling, documenting the end of something that can never be put back together the same way.

t-FADE TO BLACK.
