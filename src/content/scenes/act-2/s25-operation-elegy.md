SCENE START

INT. MI5 SAFE HOUSE - NIGHT (LATE NOVEMBER 1969)

The room is cold, lit by a single bare bulb. The air is stale with the ghosts of a thousand sordid secrets.

SIR DEREK FINCHLEY (58), NIGEL FINCH (52), and CLIVE BARROW (45) sit around a cheap wooden table. An overflowing ashtray sits between them. Finchley looks as if he's just swallowed something foul but is maintaining his professional composure.

The mood is funereal.

  SIR DEREK FINCHLEY
  (Clears his throat)
  Gentlemen. I have just come from a meeting at the highest level. A strategic reassessment has been made. Operation Minuet has been... concluded.

Clive looks momentarily confused, a schoolboy whose favorite game has been cancelled. Nigel says nothing, his face a mask of weary anticipation.

  SIR DEREK FINCHLEY (CONT'D)
  The operation's primary objective—the fracturing of the group—has been achieved. However, recent actions by the primary subject, Lennon, have created an unforeseen complication.

He opens a slim portfolio. It contains a single sheet of paper.

  SIR DEREK FINCHLEY (CONT'D)
  It is now the Palace's view that the subject no longer represents a cultural nuisance, but a political one. As such, a new directive has been issued.

He slides the paper across the table. It's a memo, typed, with no letterhead and no signature. It is a ghost.

  SIR DEREK FINCHLEY (CONT'D)
  The subject's file is to be closed. His activities are to be brought to a final conclusion. The matter is to be... permanently retired.

He delivers the lines in a flat, bureaucratic monotone. A man reading a weather report.

Clive leans forward, reading the memo. His eyes scan the euphemisms. A slow, strange smile spreads across his face. His eyes light up with a manic, creative glee.

  CLIVE
  (A hushed, reverent whisper)
  A permanent resolution. My God. It's the third act.

Nigel stares at Finchley, his mind struggling to process the words.

  NIGEL
  Retired? Sir, I'm not sure I understand the... operational parameters.

  SIR DEREK FINCHLEY
  (Looking him dead in the eye)
  I think you do, Nigel.

The truth lands. Nigel feels the blood drain from his face. He looks physically ill.

  NIGEL
  (Shaking his head, slowly)
  No. Sir, with respect... that's not... that is not what we do. We are an intelligence service, not... not that.

  CLIVE
  (Interrupting, his mind already racing)
  It's a question of methodology, Nigel! A final exit. It requires... artistry. A performance piece. Something public, but misdirecting. A charity concert, perhaps? The dramatic irony would be... sublime.

Nigel stares at Clive, horrified. Clive isn't seeing a man; he's seeing a plot point.

  NIGEL
  (To Finchley, pleading)
  Sir Derek. This is assassination.

He says the word. The ugly, simple truth that Finchley's elegant euphemisms were designed to hide. The word hangs in the dead air of the room.

Finchley's pleasant mask cracks, just for a second. His eyes turn to steel.

  SIR DEREK FINCHLEY
  This is a royal directive, Mr. Finch. This is not a request. It is not a debate. It is an order. Are you a loyal servant of the Crown, or are you not?

The threat is absolute, unspoken but perfectly clear.

  NIGEL
  I am a loyal servant. But this is... wrong.

  SIR DEREK FINCHLEY
  (Leaning forward, his voice a silken threat)
  What is 'wrong' is a matter for philosophers. We are professionals. You have a few years left until your pension. One would hate to see such a long and... adequate career end on a note of insubordination. Consider your options. Carefully.

He stands, straightening his suit. The briefing is over.

  SIR DEREK FINCHLEY (CONT'D)
  I expect a preliminary plan on my desk by Monday.
  (He looks at Clive)
  Something... creative.

He exits, closing the door behind him with a soft CLICK.

Clive immediately pulls out a notebook and starts sketching frantically, muttering to himself.

  CLIVE
  The stage... the lighting... a distraction in the crowd... it has to be a masterpiece...

Nigel doesn't move. He sits at the table, utterly defeated. The bumbling comedy is over. He is now the partner of a killer-in-waiting, and an accessory to a state-sanctioned murder.

His face is a portrait of a man trapped between his duty, his pension, and a conscience he never knew he had until this exact moment. The path forward contains only terrible choices.

FADE OUT.
