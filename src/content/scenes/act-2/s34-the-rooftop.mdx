t-FADE IN:

s-INT. APPLE STUDIOS - CONTROL ROOM - DAY (JANUARY 25, 1969)

a-PAUL MCCARTNEY (26) sits in the control room, listening to playbacks with JOHN LENNON (28), GEORGE HARRISON (25), and RINGO STARR (28). MICHAEL LINDSAY-HOGG (30s) and GLYN JOHNS watch them.

a-The last few days have been good - better than Twickenham. Billy Preston helped. But something's eating at Paul. He's frustrated in a different way now.

c-MICHAEL LINDSAY-HOGG
d-Originally, it was a show and an album. A live album recorded when the show was actually live on the spot. And what I think is lacking at the moment is the show.

c-JOHN
d-I would dig to play onstage, you know? I mean, if it was all... everything was all right and there was no messing and we're just gonna play onstage. You know, that's why I said yes to the TV show. I didn't want the hell of doing it, but nobody else wants to go on the stage or do a TV show. You know, that's what it's about. Nobody wants to get out there. You know?

c-PAUL
p-(admitting it)
d-I suppose that's true, you know?

c-GEORGE
d-The things that have worked out best ever for us haven't really been planned any more than this has. It's just, you know, it's like you just go into something and it does it itself. You know, whatever it's gonna be, it becomes that, you know?

c-JOHN
p-(to Paul, gently)
d-See, it's turned out it's not what Paul wants. It's like if it's... Say it's his number, this whole show. It's actually turned into our number more than his number. That's all. And, uh... It's just that, really.

c-PAUL
d-Yeah, I know, it is majority decisions and all. Yeah.

a-Paul's quiet for a moment. Then it comes out.

c-PAUL (CONT'D)
d-I just have a feeling that we... It's all right, you know? It's nothing to complain about, but... But it's just funny to sort of realize that after this is all over, you'll be off in a black bag somewhere on the Albert Hall, you know?

c-MICHAEL LINDSAY-HOGG
p-(hitting it)
d-What you're moaning about is there's no payoff.

c-PAUL
p-(the need surfacing)
d-I think all I wanna do is, like, uh... I probably, you know, having got it together, I probably just wanna go and have fun with it. Rather than just, sort of, finish off exactly as we started. And I'd like to sort of do a... for the finish. And we just get out in the open, change of scene, and go and do it somewhere else, do it on a live show, do it on a stage. You know, I'd like to light a rocket and really sort of take off for the end of it.

a-There's a moment of silence. Then Glyn Johns and Michael exchange a look.

c-MICHAEL LINDSAY-HOGG
d-What if we went up to the roof?

a-Everyone looks at him.

c-GLYN JOHNS
d-Ringo was just showing me - there's a wonderful view up there. Big flat area.

c-MICHAEL LINDSAY-HOGG
p-(the idea taking shape)
d-You could play to the whole West End from up there.

a-Paul's face changes. You can see it - the idea catching fire.

t-CUT TO:

s-EXT. APPLE STUDIOS - ROOFTOP - DAY

a-PAUL, RINGO, GLYN JOHNS, MICHAEL LINDSAY-HOGG, and MAL EVANS climb the stairs to the roof of 3 Savile Row.

a-They emerge onto a large flat rooftop. The view stretches across London - the West End spreading out before them. It's January cold, but clear.

a-Paul walks to the edge, looking out over the city. For the first time in weeks, there's real excitement in his eyes.

c-RINGO
p-(gesturing around)
d-Told you. Great view.

c-GLYN JOHNS
d-If they wanted to play to a large crowd, why not play on the roof to the whole of the West End?

a-Paul turns, looking at the space. Imagining it. Amps up here. Ringo's drums. The cameras. Playing to all of London.

c-PAUL
p-(the energy building)
d-Yeah. Yeah, we could do this.

c-MICHAEL LINDSAY-HOGG
d-The only thing is we've got to get some permission, Paul. So the cops don't come and throw us off, that's all.

c-RINGO
d-What happens if we go on top of the other roof?

c-MICHAEL LINDSAY-HOGG
d-If it's somebody else's roof, then we can get had not only for disturbing the peace and the noise, but also for trespassing.

a-But Paul's not worried about that. He's seeing it now - the climax he's been wanting. The payoff.

c-PAUL
d-The Savile Row police station is only a couple of hundred yards away. They'll probably shut us down pretty quick.

c-GLYN JOHNS
p-(grinning)
d-That'll all be part of the fun, won't it?

a-Paul laughs. Actually laughs. The first real, unguarded laugh in weeks.

c-MAL EVANS
p-(practical)
d-So, but just roughly timewise, so I can look into gear...

c-PAUL
d-Yeah. So, okay, look, if we say like on Friday or something.

a-They stand there for a moment, looking out over London. The city sprawling below them. The Beatles - or what's left of them - about to do something nobody's ever done before.

t-CUT TO:

s-INT. APPLE STUDIOS - BASEMENT - DAY

a-Back downstairs. Paul bursts in with energy the others haven't seen in ages.

c-PAUL
d-Right, we're doing it on the roof.

a-JOHN and GEORGE look up from their instruments.

c-JOHN
d-What?

c-PAUL
p-(grinning)
d-The rooftop. Wednesday or Thursday. We set up on the roof and play to all of London.

c-MICHAEL LINDSAY-HOGG
d-I think the thing is we'll aim for Thursday.

c-GEORGE HARRISON
d-Are we gonna do it all here now?

c-GEORGE MARTIN
p-(entering, practical)
d-I think you should aim for a little earlier than Thursday. 'Cause if you aim for Thursday, it's not gonna be Thursday.

c-PAUL
d-See, we have to give them a chance to get their other cameras in.

c-MICHAEL LINDSAY-HOGG
p-(with Ringo)
d-Aim for Wednesday.

c-PAUL
d-It'll be pretty quick, but it'll still give us some time to do it.

a-John watches Paul's excitement. There's something in his expression - maybe relief, maybe amusement. But he's nodding.

c-JOHN
d-All right then. Wednesday it is.

a-George looks uncertain, but he's not arguing. Ringo's already thinking about the logistics.

a-For the first time since they walked into Twickenham Film Studios nearly a month ago, they have a plan they all agree on. A goal. A climax.

a-Paul stands there, energized, alive. The rooftop concert.

c-PAUL
p-(to everyone)
d-Right. Let's rehearse. We've got three days.

a-They pick up their instruments. And for the first time in weeks, there's purpose in the room.

a-The Beatles are going to play a concert. On a rooftop. In the middle of London. And nobody - not even them - knows how it's going to turn out.

a-But that's the point.

t-FADE TO BLACK.
