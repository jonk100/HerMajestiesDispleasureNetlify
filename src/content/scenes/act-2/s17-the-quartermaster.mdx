s-INT. MI5 Q-BRANCH - DAY (EARLY 1966)

a-A cavernous, chilly storeroom in the bowels of Whitehall. Fluorescent lights hum over rows of grey metal shelving, meticulously labeled but covered in a fine layer of dust. The air smells of ozone and old Bakelite. This is where spy technology comes to die.

a-PERCY DALTON (57), a wiry man in a brown cardigan and thick glasses, stands behind a long counter, polishing a hefty piece of Cold War-era equipment with a soft cloth. He is the obsessive gatekeeper of this forgotten kingdom.

a-NIGEL FINCH (49) and CLIVE BARROW (42) approach the counter. Nigel carries a clipboard with a requisition form. Clive practically vibrates with excitement.

c-CLIVE
d-Morning, Percy! We require some kit for a... delicate undertaking. Audio surveillance. I was thinking something discreet. A miniature sonic amplifier, perhaps? Something state-of-the-art.

a-Percy stops polishing. He looks slowly up from the device, over the top of his glasses. The look is one of profound, ancient weariness.

c-PERCY
p-(clipped, irritated)
d-Form 12-C. In triplicate.

a-Nigel slides a perfectly completed form across the counter. Percy picks it up, inspects it with suspicion, then grunts.

c-PERCY (CONT'D)
d-"Miniature."
p-(he scoffs)
d-This isn't a bloody Bond film, Barrow. This is His Majesty's government. We have standards. And budgets.

a-He turns and disappears into the aisles. After a moment of rummaging, he returns, placing a heavy, metal box on the counter with a loud THUD. It looks like a car battery with a large cone attached to it.

c-PERCY (CONT'D)
d-Item 47-B. Parabolic Listening Device. German. 1953. Very reliable.

c-CLIVE
p-(deflated)
d-Right. And... how does one conceal that? In a bread van?

c-PERCY
p-(ignoring him)
d-Battery life is approximately ninety minutes, provided you don't use it in the damp. The last agent who used this in the damp, a chap in Budapest, caused a short. Do you know what a replacement valve costs for a '53 Telefunken?

a-Nigel sighs, a sound of pure existential despair.

c-NIGEL
d-Go on then, Percy.

c-PERCY
d-Fourteen pounds and sixpence! A month's wages for some people. And he didn't return it in the original packaging. Had to fill out a Form 21-A for non-compliance. Truly dreadful business.

a-Percy hands Clive a tangle of wires and a pair of enormous headphones.

c-PERCY (CONT'D)
d-Now, you lose a single one of these transmitter screws, and that comes out of your travel stipend. I'm not joking. I'll be checking the manifest upon return.

c-CLIVE
p-(desperately)
d-We're conducting a psychological ricochet operation against a major cultural target! We can't do it with a museum piece!

c-PERCY
d-You can do it with what you're given, Barrow. Just like everyone else. Sign here. And here. Initial there.

a-He pushes the clipboard toward Clive. Nigel is already walking away, having accepted their fate.

c-NIGEL
p-(over his shoulder)
d-Don't forget the original packaging, Clive.

a-Percy watches them go, then returns to polishing his device, the guardian of mediocrity, utterly content in his perfectly ordered, perfectly useless world.
