s-INT. BUCKINGHAM PALACE – BREAKFAST ROOM – MORNING

a-A long table laid with silver and porcelain. Everything gleams. Everything is correct.
a-THE QUEEN and PRINCE PHILIP sit opposite one another in perfect silence.
a-Philip reads a newspaper. The headline screams: “BEATLEMANIA HITS JAPAN.”
a-Beside it sits a smaller clipping, foreign, folded and refolded until it’s soft at the creases.
a-Just visible: “MORE POPULAR THAN JESUS.”
a-He is seething.
a-The Queen is absorbed in a crossword puzzle.

c-PRINCE PHILIP
d-They’re treated like heads of state. It’s embarrassing.

c-THE QUEEN
p-(without looking up)
d-Four down. “A chaotic disturbance.” Six letters.

c-PRINCE PHILIP
d-Did you hear the tape I played you? The “Tomorrow Never Knows” ghastliness? It sounds like a submarine in distress.

a-He taps the foreign clipping with two fingers, like a contaminant.

c-PRINCE PHILIP (CONT'D)
d-And now this Jesus remark. As if we’re meant to applaud it.

c-THE QUEEN
d-Tumult.

a-She writes it into the crossword.

c-THE QUEEN
d-Philip, you must stop listening to them if it upsets you so.

c-PRINCE PHILIP
d-I am not upset. I am vigilant. Mountbatten agrees. It is a subversion of British values. We have agents in the field, Lilibet. We are taking steps.

a-The Queen finally looks up. She peers over her spectacles.

c-THE QUEEN
d-Agents?

c-PRINCE PHILIP
d-Operational assets. To… guide them. Gently.

c-THE QUEEN
d-Just ensure these “assets” don’t make a mess on the carpet. I have a reception for the Ambassador of Chad at noon.

a-She returns to her crossword.

c-THE QUEEN
d-And Philip?

c-PRINCE PHILIP
d-Yes?

c-THE QUEEN
d-I rather liked “Yesterday.”

a-Philip stares at her, betrayed.
a-He snaps the newspaper back up, hiding his face.

c-PRINCE PHILIP
p-(from behind the paper)
d-No discipline.
