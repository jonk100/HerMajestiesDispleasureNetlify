t-FADE IN:

s-INT. BUCKINGHAM PALACE PRIVATE STUDY - DAY (LATE NOVEMBER 1969)

a-A sanctuary of austere, masculine power. The room is quiet, heavy with the weight of tradition.

a-PRINCE PHILIP (48) stands with LORD MOUNTBATTEN (69), examining a naval chart. Philip looks smug, controlled. Operation Minuet is a success. The band is broken. He has won.

a-The door opens and an AIDE enters, carrying a small, plain cardboard box on a silver tray.

c-AIDE
d-A package, Your Royal Highness. From the post room. Marked for Her Majesty's attention.

a-He places the tray on the heavy mahogany desk.

a-Philip glances at it, dismissive. Mountbatten shows a flicker of professional interest.

a-At that moment, QUEEN ELIZABETH II (43) and PRINCESS MARGARET (39) enter. The Queen carries a small stack of correspondence. Margaret drifts in behind her, a cigarette holder in hand.

c-THE QUEEN
p-(To the Aide)
d-Thank you, Robert.
p-(To Philip)
d-More charts? One would think you were planning another war.

a-She spots the box on the tray.

c-THE QUEEN (CONT'D)
d-What's this?

a-She picks up the small, unimpressive box. There is a simple letter attached. She opens the letter and begins to read. Her expression remains utterly neutral, a mask of practiced composure.

a-Philip watches her, a triumphant glint in his eye. This is the final report from the front. The enemy's unconditional surrender.

a-The Queen finishes reading. She looks up, her face betraying nothing.

c-THE QUEEN (CONT'D)
p-(Quietly)
d-Well. That's that, I suppose.

a-She hands the letter to Philip. Margaret leans over his shoulder, eager for the drama.

a-Philip takes the letter, his face a mask of smug satisfaction. He reads.

t-CLOSE ON THE LETTER. We see John's handwriting.

a-As Philip's eyes scan the text, his expression transforms. The smugness evaporates, replaced by confusion, then disbelief, then a deep, cold, incandescent rage.

c-JOHN (V.O.)
d-...as a protest against Britain's involvement in the Nigeria-Biafra thing, against our support of America in Vietnam...

a-Philip's jaw tightens. This isn't a surrender. It's a list of demands.

c-JOHN (V.O.) (CONT'D)
d-...and against 'Cold Turkey' slipping down the charts.

a-The final line hits Philip like a physical blow. The petty, narcissistic absurdity of it. The insolence.

a-Margaret lets out a low whistle, a sound of pure theatrical appreciation.

c-PRINCESS MARGARET
d-Oh, that's magnificent. "Cold Turkey"! He's mocking you. It's perfectly ghastly. I adore it.

a-Philip is no longer listening. He's staring at the letter, his knuckles white. He thought he had broken Lennon. Instead, Lennon has rejected *him*. He has taken Philip's victory and used it as a platform for his own grubby politics.

c-THE QUEEN
p-(Calmly)
d-It's an emotional gesture from an emotional young man. It will be a footnote in a week. The best response is no response.

a-But Philip is beyond reason. He crushes the letter in his fist.

c-PRINCE PHILIP
p-(His voice a low, dangerous growl)
d-No response? He didn't just return it. He spat on it.
p-(He looks at the Queen, his eyes burning)
d-He spat on *you*.

c-THE QUEEN
p-(Firmly)
d-He spat on a symbol, Philip. It is my job to be a symbol. It's a singer having a tantrum. Let it go.

c-PRINCE PHILIP
d-Let it go? We spent four years on this. We fractured them. We drove him to this. And he turns it into a... a press release for his wretched song!

a-He throws the crumpled letter onto the desk. He looks at Mountbatten, his face a mask of cold fury. The game is over.

c-PRINCE PHILIP (CONT'D)
d-He has made himself a political figure. A martyr. He's more dangerous now than he ever was with a guitar. This isn't over.

c-THE QUEEN
p-(A warning tone)
d-Philip. Be careful.

c-PRINCESS MARGARET
p-(A delighted whisper)
d-Oh, I do hope he won't be. This is getting frightfully interesting.

a-Philip ignores them both. His eyes are locked on Mountbatten's, his decision made. The personal insult has become a matter of national security. The protector of the realm has become its most dangerous zealot.

t-FADE OUT.
