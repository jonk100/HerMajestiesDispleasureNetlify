SCENE START

INT. BUCKINGHAM PALACE PRIVATE STUDY - DAY (LATE NOVEMBER 1969)

A sanctuary of austere, masculine power. The room is quiet, heavy with the weight of tradition.

PRINCE PHILIP (48) stands with LORD MOUNTBATTEN (69), examining a naval chart. Philip looks smug, controlled. Operation Minuet is a success. The band is broken. He has won.

The door opens and an AIDE enters, carrying a small, plain cardboard box on a silver tray.

  AIDE
  A package, Your Royal Highness. From the post room. Marked for Her Majesty's attention.

He places the tray on the heavy mahogany desk.

Philip glances at it, dismissive. Mountbatten shows a flicker of professional interest.

At that moment, QUEEN ELIZABETH II (43) and PRINCESS MARGARET (39) enter. The Queen carries a small stack of correspondence. Margaret drifts in behind her, a cigarette holder in hand.

  THE QUEEN
  (To the Aide)
  Thank you, Robert.
  (To Philip)
  More charts? One would think you were planning another war.

She spots the box on the tray.

  THE QUEEN (CONT'D)
  What's this?

She picks up the small, unimpressive box. There is a simple letter attached. She opens the letter and begins to read. Her expression remains utterly neutral, a mask of practiced composure.

Philip watches her, a triumphant glint in his eye. This is the final report from the front. The enemy's unconditional surrender.

The Queen finishes reading. She looks up, her face betraying nothing.

  THE QUEEN (CONT'D)
  (Quietly)
  Well. That's that, I suppose.

She hands the letter to Philip. Margaret leans over his shoulder, eager for the drama.

Philip takes the letter, his face a mask of smug satisfaction. He reads.

CLOSE ON THE LETTER. We see John's handwriting.

As Philip's eyes scan the text, his expression transforms. The smugness evaporates, replaced by confusion, then disbelief, then a deep, cold, incandescent rage.

  JOHN (V.O.)
  ...as a protest against Britain's involvement in the Nigeria-Biafra thing, against our support of America in Vietnam...

Philip's jaw tightens. This isn't a surrender. It's a list of demands.

  JOHN (V.O.) (CONT'D)
  ...and against 'Cold Turkey' slipping down the charts.

The final line hits Philip like a physical blow. The petty, narcissistic absurdity of it. The insolence.

Margaret lets out a low whistle, a sound of pure theatrical appreciation.

  PRINCESS MARGARET
  Oh, that's magnificent. "Cold Turkey"! He's mocking you. It's perfectly ghastly. I adore it.

Philip is no longer listening. He's staring at the letter, his knuckles white. He thought he had broken Lennon. Instead, Lennon has rejected *him*. He has taken Philip's victory and used it as a platform for his own grubby politics.

  THE QUEEN
  (Calmly)
  It's an emotional gesture from an emotional young man. It will be a footnote in a week. The best response is no response.

But Philip is beyond reason. He crushes the letter in his fist.

  PRINCE PHILIP
  (His voice a low, dangerous growl)
  No response? He didn't just return it. He spat on it.
  (He looks at the Queen, his eyes burning)
  He spat on *you*.

  THE QUEEN
  (Firmly)
  He spat on a symbol, Philip. It is my job to be a symbol. It's a singer having a tantrum. Let it go.

  PRINCE PHILIP
  Let it go? We spent four years on this. We fractured them. We drove him to this. And he turns it into a... a press release for his wretched song!

He throws the crumpled letter onto the desk. He looks at Mountbatten, his face a mask of cold fury. The game is over.

  PRINCE PHILIP (CONT'D)
  He has made himself a political figure. A martyr. He's more dangerous now than he ever was with a guitar. This isn't over.

  THE QUEEN
  (A warning tone)
  Philip. Be careful.

  PRINCESS MARGARET
  (A delighted whisper)
  Oh, I do hope he won't be. This is getting frightfully interesting.

Philip ignores them both. His eyes are locked on Mountbatten's, his decision made. The personal insult has become a matter of national security. The protector of the realm has become its most dangerous zealot.

FADE OUT.
