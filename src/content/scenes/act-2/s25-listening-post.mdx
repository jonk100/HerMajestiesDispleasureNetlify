s-EXT. LONDON STREET – DAY (EARLY 1966)

a-A perfectly ordinary London street. Buses hiss. Shoppers drift past. Nothing of consequence is happening.

a-At a small wrought-iron café table sit NIGEL FINCH and CLIVE BARROW, dressed in painfully unremarkable civilian clothes. Tea cups steam gently between them.

a-On the table: a folded newspaper, a sugar bowl, and a battered leather briefcase.
a-Tucked under the newspaper is a second clipping—foreign—its headline too large, too American.
a-The words “MORE POPULAR THAN JESUS” are visible for a moment before Nigel’s hand covers them.

a-Nigel stirs his tea with quiet precision.

a-Clive is vibrating.

c-CLIVE
d-All right. This is it. This is where it becomes theatre.

a-Nigel does not look up.

c-NIGEL
d-We are drinking tea.

c-CLIVE
d-Exactly. Performance art. The mundane as camouflage.

a-Nigel sighs.

c-NIGEL
d-Please don’t say “performance art” in public.

a-Clive opens the briefcase just enough to peer inside. A tangled mess of wires, valves, and dials.

c-CLIVE
d-I’ve recalibrated the receiver. Narrowed the frequency band. Reduced interference.

c-NIGEL
d-From what?

c-CLIVE
d-Reality.

a-Nigel checks his watch.

a-Across the street: a terraced house. Curtains drawn. No movement.

c-NIGEL
d-We are listening for…?

c-CLIVE
p-(conspiratorial)
d-Influence. Intent. The psychic residue of celebrity.

a-Nigel closes his eyes briefly.

c-NIGEL
d-We are listening for sound, Clive.

c-CLIVE
d-Yes, but sound adjacent.

a-Clive removes a device from the briefcase. It is far too large to be discreet.

a-He places it on the café table. It does not belong there.

a-A WAITRESS pauses mid-step, staring.

c-WAITRESS
d-…is that a radio?

c-CLIVE
d-Experimental.

a-Nigel instinctively reaches for identification, then stops himself.

c-NIGEL
d-It’s German.

a-The waitress walks away, unsettled.

a-Clive fits oversized headphones over his ears.

c-CLIVE
p-(reverent)
d-I’m in.

a-Nigel leans closer despite himself.

c-NIGEL
d-And?

a-Static crackles. A distant, unintelligible voice flickers.

c-CLIVE
d-Wait… there. Did you hear that?

c-NIGEL
d-Hear what?

c-CLIVE
d-Intent.

a-Nigel listens. Nothing.

c-NIGEL
d-I heard a kettle.

c-CLIVE
d-Yes. Domestic ritual. The unseen architecture of influence.

a-Nigel rubs his temples.

c-NIGEL
d-We’re meant to observe. Not commune.

a-Clive leans toward the device.

c-CLIVE
d-We’re listening.

a-A sudden LOUD POP from the headphones.

a-Clive yelps, tearing them off.

c-CLIVE
d-That was something.

c-NIGEL
d-That was a bus.

a-Silence.

a-A dog barks nearby.

a-The device hums, then dies.

c-CLIVE
d-Battery’s gone.

a-Nigel closes the briefcase.

c-NIGEL
d-We’ve gathered sufficient intelligence.

c-CLIVE
d-Already?

c-NIGEL
d-Yes. Nothing happened. No one spoke. The nation remains intact.

a-Nigel scans the room unassumingly. Clive considers this, shaking his head.

c-CLIVE
d-That’s not what concerns me.

c-NIGEL
d-Oh?

c-CLIVE
d-There was no center. No voice. No instruction. Just… diffusion.

c-NIGEL
d-That’s always been the case with popular culture.

c-CLIVE
d-No. Popular culture amplifies authority. This dissolves it.

a-Nigel considers this, genuinely.

c-NIGEL
d-They don’t issue commands.

c-CLIVE
d-Exactly. They don’t replace authority — they make it irrelevant.

a-Nigel stirs his tea again. Slower now.

c-NIGEL
d-I’d argue the opposite. They become it. Accidentally.

c-CLIVE
p-(skeptical)
d-You don't think they know what they’re doing?

c-NIGEL
d-I think it doesn’t matter whether they do.
p-(glancing at the clipping)
d-It matters what other people decide they meant.

a-The street continues. A bus hisses. A spoon clinks somewhere.

c-CLIVE
p-(confused)
d-So what sort of threat is that?

a-Nigel stands, pushing the briefcase toward Clive. He places understandingly exact change on the table.

c-NIGEL
d-The sort you don’t arrest. 
p-(matter-of-fact)
d-The sort you redirect.

a-He starts to walk away, but stops and turns to Clive.

c-NIGEL
d-Let’s never do this again.

a-He walks away. The café remains unchanged. 

a-Clive opens the device, connects the headphones, twiddles with a few buttons. No luck.
a-He puts it away and stares through the window.
a-His eyes drift to the American clipping beneath Nigel’s hand.

c-CLIVE
p-(quiet, to himself)
d-If there’s no voice… you manufacture one.

a-Nigel doesn’t react. He simply stirs his tea.
a-Clive’s determination hardens into something practical.

a-The house across the street remains silent.

t-CUT TO BLACK.
