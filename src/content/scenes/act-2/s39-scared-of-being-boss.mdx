t-FADE IN:

s-INT. TWICKENHAM FILM STUDIOS - DAY (JANUARY 6, 1969)

a-The vast, cold soundstage. Harsh fluorescent lights cast everything in an institutional glow. The Beatles' equipment sits in the center - guitars, amps, Ringo's drums - looking small and isolated in the cavernous space.

a-Film cameras are positioned around the room, their presence adding pressure to an already tense atmosphere.

a-JOHN LENNON (28) sits at the piano, not playing, just present. YOKO ONO (36) sits nearby in her black clothing, a constant, silent presence.

a-RINGO STARR (28) sits behind his drum kit, tapping his sticks lightly, waiting.

a-PAUL MCCARTNEY (26) stands with his Höfner bass, trying to generate energy. He's clearly frustrated but attempting to stay constructive.

a-GEORGE HARRISON (25) sits with his guitar, looking weary. There's a resignation in his posture that wasn't there in earlier years.

a-They've been working on "Two Of Us" for what feels like hours. It's not coming together.

c-PAUL
p-(with forced enthusiasm)
d-See, look. Listen, now. We're gonna have to sort of bring it together, 'cause we're all at odds. We're doing that thing we did on 'The Beatles'. Like, in this verse, it's two harmonies singing, trying to say some words, right?

c-JOHN
p-(flatly, not looking up)
d-I'm not that bothered. I'm just trying to sing it.

c-PAUL
d-It's not sounding together.

c-GEORGE
d-And so we can only play until we find the bit.

c-PAUL
d-Or we can stop and say it's not together.

c-GEORGE
d-Yes, then you've got to carry on until it gets together.

a-JOHN picks out a few notes on the piano, seemingly uninterested in the debate.

c-JOHN
d-These are the hard ones to do, aren't they?

c-PAUL
p-(increasingly frustrated)
d-No, not really, it's just... We've got to be imaginative. You know, it's complicated now. See, if we can get it simpler and then complicate it where it needs complication, but it's complicated in the bit...

c-GEORGE
p-(cutting him off)
d-It's not complicated. I'll play just the chords, if you like.

a-Paul stops. He recognizes the tone - George is pulling back, disengaging.

c-PAUL
p-(trying to bridge the gap)
d-No, no, come on. You always get annoyed when I say that. I'm trying to help, you know. But I always hear myself annoying you, and I'm trying...

c-GEORGE
p-(resigned, almost defeated)
d-No, you're not annoying me. You don't annoy me anymore.

a-The words hang in the air. "Anymore." As if George has moved past annoyance into something else - apathy, perhaps.

c-PAUL
d-But you see what I mean. We do this then... Then I don't know.

a-A long pause. The cameras keep rolling. Ringo taps his sticks quietly. John plays a few more notes, deliberately not engaging.

a-Paul takes a breath. Something shifts in him - a moment of raw honesty.

c-PAUL (CONT'D)
p-(vulnerable, almost confessional)
d-I'm scared of me being the boss. And I have been for a couple of years. I always feel as though I'm trying to put you down and stop you playing. But I'm not. I'm trying to stop us all playing, until we know what we're playing.

a-George looks at him. There's a flicker of recognition - this is Paul being genuine.

c-GEORGE
d-But you've got to play in order to find which fits and which doesn't. You see that's all we can do.

c-PAUL
p-(the honesty continuing, almost desperate now)
d-I don't wanna say it, 'cause I really just hear myself as being the only one saying it, always. And like, the three of you just sort of sit there, like 'Oh, he's saying that one again, is he?' And I never get any support, or anything. So I just think, 'Oh, well. Fuck it'. And I know it's right, and you know it's right.

a-John continues playing piano, seemingly unbothered. Yoko sits motionless. Ringo looks uncomfortable - caught between his bandmates.

c-GEORGE
p-(quietly)
d-Yes, all right. I just don't know what to do about it.

c-PAUL
d-But doesn't everyone agree that it's confused at the moment. So, all I'm trying to say is, we've only got 12 more days, so we've really got to do this methodically, this one.

c-GEORGE
p-(the resignation back)
d-I'll wait until you get all your bits and then work my part out, if you like. It's like a matter of working it out with you, while you're working your bit out. You know, have you got your bass bit?

a-Paul's frustration returns. George is doing it again - making it about Paul being difficult.

c-PAUL
d-You're doing it again as though I'm trying to say that. And what we said the other day, you know, I'm not trying to get you. What I really am trying to just say, 'Look lads, the band, shall we try it like this, you know?'

c-GEORGE
p-(with an edge)
d-It's funny how it only occurs when the...

c-PAUL
p-(interrupting, trying an analogy)
d-It's like 'shall we play guitar all through Hey Jude?' Well, I don't think we should.

c-GEORGE
p-(quietly, but the words cut deep)
d-Okay, well, I don't mind. I'll play whatever you want me to play. Or I won't play at all if you don't want me to play. Now, whatever it is that will please you, I'll do it. But I don't think you really know what that one is.

a-The words land like a blow. Paul's face shows he feels it.

a-A long, uncomfortable silence. The cameras continue rolling, documenting every moment of this dissolution.

c-PAUL
p-(trying to recover, to explain)
d-Look, you know, the... No, it's not like that. You see, that's it, it's like, we can't do this. We've really got to sort out this, 'cause we're – this is – we're like – this is the one, you know. Now we're rehearsing, and we're trying to like get it together for a TV show, so we really – like you said, we've only been through four numbers, you know.

c-GEORGE
d-Mm.

c-JOHN
p-(finally engaging, but only minimally)
d-Well...

c-PAUL
p-(pressing on)
d-So we've probably got to get some system to get through like twenty, or thirty, and no more, and have learnt them. And it's probably going to be like sculpture. So that we get all the chords. So we can all vamp and all. Then we can all play, like, every solo we need. But like... You know what I mean? It's got to sound as though it's improving.

c-GEORGE
p-(careful, but honest)
d-Yeah, well, it actually – it sounded to me, that for me, it was a waste of me time playing, when we started it today. I mean, I just started remembering then what it could get into the other day, after playing for around an hour, an hour and a half. And suddenly, you know, I just don't find that my – that what I'm doing is starting to have something, you know. Have some structure to it.

a-He pauses.

c-GEORGE (CONT'D)
d-You know, that's the thing.

c-PAUL
p-(trying to understand)
d-Yeah, I know, I know what you mean, you know. 'Cause it's like—

c-GEORGE
p-(interrupting)
d-You know, I mean—

c-PAUL
p-(the fundamental problem surfacing)
d-It's just that that way of doing it, you know, puts me off the way I'm trying to do it, and—

c-GEORGE
p-(resigned, final)
d-Well, that's – you know. That's all, then. I can only do me, in that one way, however I do it, you know.

a-A long pause. The impasse is complete. John plays a few more piano notes. Yoko remains still. Ringo looks at his drumsticks.

c-PAUL
p-(defeated)
d-Let's do another song.

c-GEORGE
p-(trying to be constructive despite everything)
d-No, come on, we just have to learn this—

c-PAUL
p-(firm, done with this conversation)
d-No, no, it's – let's just do something else.

c-GEORGE
d-Do you want to do... 'Maxwell's Silver Hammer'?

c-JOHN
p-(finally showing some engagement)
d-Well, let's do this, 'cause then we – we're gonna come to this, or whatever it is. And the thing is just try and think what – the stage we've got to be in then.

c-PAUL
p-(the frustration boiling over)
d-You just have to know that. I think we've wasted a lot of time, I think. I think we do like waste, physically waste a heck of a lot of time, you know, when the four of us are together.

a-The words echo in the cavernous space. "When the four of us are together." The very thing that made them The Beatles is now the problem.

a-The cameras continue rolling. The fluorescent lights buzz overhead. The Beatles sit with their instruments, unable to play together, unable to move forward, unable to go back.

t-FADE TO BLACK.
