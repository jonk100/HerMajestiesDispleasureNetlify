SCENE START

Subject Immunity

FADE IN:

INT. ABBEY ROAD STUDIOS LOUNGE - DAY (MARCH 1969)

The comfortable retreat. Worn leather furniture, gold records, tall windows. The space feels familiar but tense.

JOHN LENNON (28) and PAUL MCCARTNEY (26) sit in armchairs, their body language rigid. On a side table between them sits a delicate china teacup, steam rising from the amber liquid. It's positioned perfectly to be in John's reach.

  PAUL
  (quietly, controlled)
  We can't just... abandon everything we've built, John. The fans, the music, the—

  JOHN
  (interrupting, weary)
  The what, Paul? The machine? The bloody circus?

CUT TO:

INT. MI5 SURVEILLANCE VAN - CONTINUOUS

CLIVE BARROW (45) leans into his equipment, eyes gleaming. NIGEL FINCH (52) reads a file, unimpressed.

  CLIVE
  (into his radio, a hushed whisper)
  The catalyst is in the pot. Once ingested, the psychoactive compound will amplify his existing paranoia and creative anxieties. It will shatter the group's cohesion from the inside.

  NIGEL
  (without looking up)
  Or he'll just write another song about a walrus.

Clive glares at him, then puts his headphones back on, focusing intently.

BACK TO:

INT. ABBEY ROAD STUDIOS LOUNGE - CONTINUOUS

  PAUL
  (leaning forward)
  The band. Our band.

John looks away, his jaw tight. The teacup sits untouched.

  JOHN
  (after a pause)
  Maybe it's time to admit it's not our band anymore. Maybe it never was.

The door bursts open. RINGO STARR (29) enters, radiating uncomplicated good humor.

  RINGO
  (grinning)
  Blimey, you two. Give it a rest. Like an old married couple, you are.

Ringo spots the teacup. His face lights up.

  RINGO (CONT'D)
  Ooh, is that for anyone? Parched, I am.

Before either John or Paul can respond, Ringo plucks the teacup from its saucer.

CUT TO:

INT. MI5 SURVEILLANCE VAN - CONTINUOUS

Clive hears this and his body goes rigid.

  CLIVE
  (whispering urgently)
  Non-target approaching the delivery mechanism. Abort! ABORT!

But it's too late. Through his headphones, he hears Ringo take a long, satisfying sip.

  RINGO (V.O.)
  (through the radio, cheerful)
  That's nice. Bit lemony. The steam's making lovely patterns...

Clive's face cycles through confusion, realization, then pure, silent rage. He rips the headset off with a CLATTER.

  CLIVE
  (exploding)
  Subject Immunity! It's scientifically impossible!

He gestures wildly at the radio equipment.

  CLIVE (CONT'D)
  (ranting)
  Five years of psychological profiling! It's supposed to induce ego fragmentation! Paranoia! Not... not a bloody tea review!

  NIGEL
  (dryly, not looking up from his file)
  He seems content.

  CLIVE
  (desperately)
  But the operational parameters! The psycho-chemical matrix! The—

  NIGEL
  (sighing)
  Clive.

Nigel opens a thick file folder labeled "STARR, R." He flips to a page that's mostly blank.

  NIGEL (CONT'D)
  (reading aloud)
  "Subject displays a baseline level of contentment impervious to psycho-chemical manipulation. Possesses no exploitable ego or anxieties. Recommendation: ignore."

He closes the file with the finality of a judge's gavel.

  NIGEL (CONT'D)
  (matter-of-factly)
  He's immune, Clive. Some people just are.

Clive slumps in his chair, defeated. The sophisticated technology around him suddenly looks like expensive junk.

Nigel makes a small notation in his logbook. Outside, London continues its day, completely unaware that a government conspiracy has just been neutralized by a thirsty drummer.
