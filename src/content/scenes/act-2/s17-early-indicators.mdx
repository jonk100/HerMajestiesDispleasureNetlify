s-INT. MI5 ANALYSIS OFFICE – DAY

a-A small, overheated room stacked with manila folders and filing trays. A fan turns without conviction.
a-A framed portrait of the Queen watches the room with the same expression as the radiator.
a-A blackboard reads:
a-“CULTURAL THREATS - DOMESTIC.”
a-Beneath it, in chalk: “BEATLES?”

a-NIGEL FINCH stands at the blackboard, methodically underlining a typed transcript pinned to it.
a-The paper is stamped in three places: “CONFIDENTIAL,” “UNVERIFIED,” and “FOR INTERNAL DISCUSSION ONLY.”
a-Under the transcript, Nigel has taped a neat list titled:
a-"EARLY INDICATORS OF DOMESTIC INSTABILITY"
a-(1) CHURCH RESPONSE
a-(2) PARLIAMENTARY QUESTIONS
a-(3) PRESS AMPLIFICATION
a-(4) PUBLIC ORDER / POLICING
a-(5) ROYAL CORRESPONDENCE (UNSOLICITED)

a-CLIVE BARROW sits at a desk littered with notes, underlines, arrows, circles. His transcript is nearly illegible from annotation.
a-Next to Clive’s papers is an empty tea mug and a paperback with the spine cracked from being used as a coaster.

c-NIGEL
d-Contextually, it’s unremarkable. A newspaper interview. Mild philosophical speculation. No call to action.

c-CLIVE
p-(already agitated)
d-You’re isolating the words. That’s your mistake.

a-Nigel turns, calm.

c-NIGEL
d-I’m evaluating them.

c-CLIVE
d-That’s worse. These aren’t parliamentary remarks. They’re memetic. They travel sideways. They're...
p-(searching for the phrase)
d-Ideological pollen.

a-Clive rises, begins pacing.

c-CLIVE (CONT’D)
d-"Christianity will go." "We're more popular than Jesus." He says it like he's remarking on the weather.
p-(with reverence, as if quoting scripture)
d-That’s not theology, Nigel. That’s prophecy delivered by a haircut with a global distribution network.

a-Nigel frowns thoughtfully.

c-NIGEL
d-He didn’t say it should go.

c-CLIVE
d-That’s irrelevant. He said it will. Authority without responsibility.

a-Nigel flips a page.
a-He is looking at a thin, typed sheet titled: “RESPONSE SUMMARY - PRELIMINARY.” It is almost entirely blank.

c-NIGEL
d-The article hasn’t caused any domestic reaction.
p-(reading with clinical precision)
d-No editorials. No church response. No public agitation. No Special Branch notes. No questions in the Commons.
p-(a beat)
d-No unsolicited letters to the Palace, either. Which is...
p-(carefully)
d-Rare.

c-CLIVE
p-(leaning in)
d-Yet.

a-Nigel sighs. The kind of sigh that has survived two governments and a marriage.

c-NIGEL
d-Our remit is national security. Not tone policing.

c-CLIVE
p-(fervent)
d-Culture is security now. Didn’t you read the memorandum?

c-NIGEL
d-I wrote it.

a-Beat.
a-Clive stops pacing, offended by competence.

c-CLIVE
d-Then you know what this is.

c-NIGEL
d-I know what it isn’t.

a-Nigel taps the transcript.

c-NIGEL (CONT’D)
d-It isn’t sedition. It isn’t instruction. It isn’t leadership.

c-CLIVE
d-That’s exactly why it’s dangerous.
p-(excited by his own logic)
d-Leadership implies accountability. This is something newer. A soft authority. A kind of...
p-(smiling, confidently)
d-McLuhan thing.

a-Nigel looks at him.

c-NIGEL
d-A McLuhan thing.

c-CLIVE
d-The medium is the messiah.

a-Nigel blinks once.

c-NIGEL
d-I believe it’s “message.”

c-CLIVE
d-Yes. Precisely. That.

a-Clive sweeps an arm over his desk, indicating a chaotic diagram of arrows and circles.

c-CLIVE (CONT’D)
d-Lennon says it. A girl reads it in the Standard. She repeats it at a bus stop. A vicar hears it. The vicar preaches about it. Then-
p-(gesturing, grand)
d--order begins to dissolve.

c-NIGEL
d-That is a remarkably ambitious bus stop.

a-Clive ignores the sarcasm.

c-CLIVE
d-You’re looking for riots. I’m looking for the pre-riot weather patterns.

a-Nigel picks up a small stack of clippings.

c-NIGEL
d-I’m looking for anything measurable.
p-(dry)
d-So far, the only measurable outcome is that the editor has sold three hundred extra copies by pretending the rest of the interview doesn’t exist.

c-CLIVE
p-(quick)
d-And that’s the point. The distortion is the delivery system.

a-Nigel flips to a blank MI5 form.

c-NIGEL
d-If you want an escalation, you’ll need to fill in an escalation request.

c-CLIVE
d-You can’t form your way out of a cultural event.

c-NIGEL
d-You can in this building.

a-Beat.
a-Clive takes the form anyway. Stares at it like it’s an insult.

c-CLIVE
d-What’s it called?

c-NIGEL
d-Form C-17.

c-CLIVE
d-C-17.
p-(suspicious)
d-Why does “culture” have a seventeen?

c-NIGEL
d-Because someone once tried to file jazz under “foreign interference.”

a-Clive processes this as if it proves his entire theory.

c-CLIVE
d-Exactly.

a-Nigel studies him.

c-NIGEL
d-You’re eager.

c-CLIVE
p-(defensive)
d-I’m attentive.

c-NIGEL
d-You want this to matter.

a-Clive pauses. Then, quietly-

c-CLIVE
d-Someone should be paying attention.
p-(a flash of sincerity)
d-Not because he’s evil. Because he’s believed.
p-(recovering, faster)
d-And belief is the only thing we don’t have a file cabinet for.

a-Nigel softens slightly.

c-NIGEL
d-We are.
p-(then)
d-But we’re not going to invent a crisis because we’re bored.

a-Clive looks at the blackboard.

c-CLIVE
d-I’m not bored.

c-NIGEL
d-No.
p-(quietly)
d-You’re ambitious.

a-That lands. For a second, it’s not banter.
a-Clive’s eyes go to Nigel’s “EARLY INDICATORS” list.

c-CLIVE
d-So what happens if it stays quiet?

c-NIGEL
d-Then we file it.

c-CLIVE
d-And if it doesn’t?

c-NIGEL
d-Then we pretend we predicted it.

a-Clive almost laughs. Almost.

a-Behind them, the chalkboard question remains unanswered.

a-“BEATLES?”

a-Nigel reaches up and, in small, neat letters under the question, writes:
a-"NO ACTION REQUIRED."

a-Clive watches until Nigel’s back is turned. Then Clive adds, underneath, in messier chalk:
a-"YET."
