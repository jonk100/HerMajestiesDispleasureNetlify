SCENE START

INT. BUCKINGHAM PALACE PRIVATE STUDY - NIGHT (LATE NOVEMBER 1969)

The room is dark, save for a single green-shaded lamp on the heavy desk, casting long, menacing shadows. The atmosphere is funereal.

PRINCE PHILIP (48) stands by the fireplace, staring into the flames. He is unnervingly still. The explosive rage from the afternoon has cooled into something far more dangerous: icy, resolute calm.

LORD MOUNTBATTEN (69) sits in a leather armchair, a glass of brandy untouched beside him.

SIR DEREK FINCHLEY (58), the Deputy Director of MI5, sits opposite him, looking deeply uneasy. He holds a slim, empty portfolio on his lap. He was summoned, not invited.

The QUEEN is notably absent. This is not a state matter anymore. This is personal.

  MOUNTBATTEN
  (Breaking the silence)
  The press is treating it as a celebrity tantrum. The Times called the 'Cold Turkey' reference 'gauche'. In a week, it will be forgotten. In a strategic sense, the operation was a success. The group is fractured beyond repair. The primary objective has been met.

Philip turns slowly from the fire. His face is a mask.

  PRINCE PHILIP
  The primary objective? Was it?
  (He walks slowly toward the desk)
  The objective, as I recall, was to neutralize a nuisance. To remind these people of the proper order of things.

He stops, looking down at Finchley, who shrinks slightly under his gaze.

  PRINCE PHILIP (CONT'D)
  Instead, we have created a political symbol. We have spent four years turning a court jester into a Joan of Arc. He's more dangerous now than he ever was with a guitar.

  MOUNTBATTEN
  He's a musician, Philip. His influence is... ephemeral.

  PRINCE PHILIP
  (A sharp, cold laugh)
  Is it? He's met with prime ministers. He holds press conferences about world peace from a bed. He has the ear of an entire generation. And now, he has a legitimate grievance. He has our attention. And we gave it to him.

Finchley shifts uncomfortably in his chair. He is a bureaucrat, a man of plausible deniability. This conversation is becoming dangerously concrete.

  SIR DEREK FINCHLEY
  Your Highness, MI5's official assessment is that while Lennon is a person of interest, he does not constitute a direct threat to national—

  PRINCE PHILIP
  (Cutting him off, his voice like ice)
  Your 'official assessment' is a document designed to protect your pension, Sir Derek. I am talking about reality.
  (He leans on the desk, his voice dropping)
  The man has publicly accused the Crown of complicity in war. He has used an honour from the Sovereign as a political weapon. He is no longer a nuisance. He is a dissident. And dissidents... must be managed.

Mountbatten senses where this is going. He sits up, his expression hardening.

  MOUNTBATTEN
  Philip, we must be exceedingly careful here. Any overt action would be catastrophic.

  PRINCE PHILIP
  I am not suggesting an overt action. I am suggesting a final one.

The room goes utterly still. Finchley looks like he wants to dissolve into the floor. This is a line he never, ever wanted to cross.

  PRINCE PHILIP (CONT'D)
  Operation Minuet was a success in its tactics, but its strategy was flawed. It was a dance. It was about disruption. The terms have now changed.

He looks directly at Mountbatten, the command clear in his eyes.

  PRINCE PHILIP (CONT'D)
  Operation Minuet is terminated. Effective immediately.
  (He pauses, letting the finality sink in)
  We are activating a new protocol. Operation... 'Elegy'.

  MOUNTBATTEN
  (Quietly)
  An elegy is a funeral song.

  PRINCE PHILIP
  Precisely. This is no longer about disruption, Dickie. This is about silencing a threat. Permanently.

Sir Derek Finchley visibly pales. This is no longer a cynical game of psychological manipulation. This is a royal directive for an assassination.

  SIR DEREK FINCHLEY
  (Stammering)
  Your... Your Highness... that is... such a measure would be... unprecedented. The blowback...

  PRINCE PHILIP
  (Straightening up, his voice regaining its command)
  The blowback for allowing a public figure to repeatedly and publicly defy the Crown is far greater. That is the very definition of sedition.
  (To Mountbatten)
  I want a plan. Quiet. Plausible. Final. Use the same assets. They are already compromised.

Mountbatten stares at his nephew, seeing the full extent of his obsession. The protector of the monarchy has become its greatest liability. But an order has been given.

  MOUNTBATTEN
  (After a long silence, a slight, almost imperceptible nod)
  As you wish.

Philip turns back to the fire, his back to them both. The decision is made. The conversation is over.

Finchley sits frozen, clutching his portfolio, a man trapped in a waking nightmare. He has just become accessory to a plot he wants no part of, ordered by a man he cannot refuse.

FADE OUT.
