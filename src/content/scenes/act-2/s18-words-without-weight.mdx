s-INT. BEATLES REHEARSAL SPACE – EVENING

a-A cluttered room. Instruments everywhere. Ashtrays overflowing. A half-empty teacup balances on an amplifier like a dare.
a-A radio murmurs somewhere in the background, mostly swallowed by the room’s own noise.

a-JOHN sits cross-legged on the floor, tuning a guitar absentmindedly.
a-His attention is split: half on the strings, half on something invisible in his head.

a-PAUL paces, humming, notebook in hand.
a-He keeps stopping to write a line, crossing it out, writing another. He’s conducting the room.

c-PAUL
d-You know what’ll happen, don’t you?

c-JOHN
p-(without looking up)
d-I’ll finish tuning eventually.

c-PAUL
d-I mean the interview.

a-John plucks a string. The note wobbles, then settles.

c-JOHN
d-It’s just Maureen. She’s not a vicar.

c-PAUL
d-You said Christianity’s dying.

c-JOHN
d-It is.

c-PAUL
d-You said it like a fact.

c-JOHN
p-(grinning)
d-Facts are allowed.

a-Paul stops pacing. He looks at John like he’s trying to translate him.

c-PAUL
d-Yeah, but facts upset people.

a-John looks up now.

c-JOHN
d-Only if they were using them as furniture.
p-(then, softer)
d-And half of them are.

a-Paul exhales, rubs his face.

c-PAUL
d-You don’t get how it sounds.

c-JOHN
d-I get exactly how it sounds. Honest.
p-(shrugs)
d-It sounds like a bloke talking.

c-PAUL
d-Honest isn’t neutral.
p-(with forced calm)
d-You say a thing and it stops being yours.

a-John stands, slings the guitar over his shoulder.
a-He walks a small circle, as if he needs motion to think.

c-JOHN
d-I’m not telling anyone what to think.

c-PAUL
d-You don’t have to.
p-(pointing at the air)
d-They’ll do it for you. They’ll take the best bit, the worst bit, the funniest bit-
p-(a beat)
d-and that’s you, forever.

a-Beat.
a-John’s smile flickers. There’s the smallest flash of insecurity, quickly turned into a joke.

c-JOHN
p-(lighter)
d-I’m not Jesus, Paul.

c-PAUL
d-That’s not the bit people will hear.

a-John laughs, but it lands a fraction too hard.

c-JOHN
d-You worry too much. People can tell the difference between a bloke thinking out loud and a sermon.
p-(with a grin that dares the world to disagree)
d-They’re not idiots.

a-Paul studies him - not convinced.

c-PAUL
d-I hope so.
p-(then, quieter)
d-Because I’m the one who’s got to walk it back when they decide you’ve declared war on God.

c-JOHN
d-I’m not declaring war on anything.
p-(irritated by the idea)
d-I’m saying what everyone’s thinking.

c-PAUL
d-Everyone isn’t thinking it into a microphone.

a-John plucks the strings again, harder now. He’s bristling.

c-JOHN
d-You know what I’m sick of?
p-(a flash of working-class bite)
d-Being told there are certain thoughts you’re only allowed to have quietly.

c-PAUL
p-(gentle, trying to keep him from the edge)
d-I’m not saying don’t think it. I’m saying-
p-(searching)
d-don’t hand them the scissors.

c-JOHN
d-I’m not handing anyone anything.

a-Paul gestures to his notebook.

c-PAUL
d-I spend all day stitching the thing together.
p-(meaning: the band, the story, the myth)
d-You spend five minutes unpicking it because you like the sound it makes.

a-Beat. John looks away.

c-JOHN
p-(defensive, but honest)
d-I don’t like the sound.
p-(then)
d-I just can’t stand pretending.

a-John strums a chord - loud, unresolved.
a-The chord hangs. Neither of them fills the silence.

c-JOHN
d-Anyway. If words were dangerous, we’d have been arrested by now.

a-Paul doesn’t laugh.
a-He looks past John, toward the door, as if expecting someone to come in with consequences.

a-John shrugs and launches into a riff.

a-Paul joins in reluctantly.

a-The music swells - confident, unaware.
a-The radio in the corner clicks into clearer reception for a moment.
a-A NEWSREADER mentions “a remark by John Lennon” and then the signal slips back into static.
a-Neither of them stop playing.
