t-FADE IN:

s-INT. MI5 SAFE HOUSE - NIGHT (LATE NOVEMBER 1969)

a-The room is cold, lit by a single bare bulb. The air is stale with the ghosts of a thousand sordid secrets.

a-SIR DEREK FINCHLEY (58), NIGEL FINCH (52), and CLIVE BARROW (45) sit around a cheap wooden table. An overflowing ashtray sits between them. Finchley looks as if he's just swallowed something foul but is maintaining his professional composure.

a-The mood is funereal.

c-SIR DEREK FINCHLEY
p-(Clears his throat)
d-Gentlemen. I have just come from a meeting at the highest level. A strategic reassessment has been made. Operation Minuet has been... concluded.

a-Clive looks momentarily confused, a schoolboy whose favorite game has been cancelled. Nigel says nothing, his face a mask of weary anticipation.

c-SIR DEREK FINCHLEY (CONT'D)
d-The operation's primary objective—the fracturing of the group—has been achieved. However, recent actions by the primary subject, Lennon, have created an unforeseen complication.

a-He opens a slim portfolio. It contains a single sheet of paper.

c-SIR DEREK FINCHLEY (CONT'D)
d-It is now the Palace's view that the subject no longer represents a cultural nuisance, but a political one. As such, a new directive has been issued.

a-He slides the paper across the table. It's a memo, typed, with no letterhead and no signature. It is a ghost.

c-SIR DEREK FINCHLEY (CONT'D)
d-The subject's file is to be closed. His activities are to be brought to a final conclusion. The matter is to be... permanently retired.

a-He delivers the lines in a flat, bureaucratic monotone. A man reading a weather report.

a-Clive leans forward, reading the memo. His eyes scan the euphemisms. A slow, strange smile spreads across his face. His eyes light up with a manic, creative glee.

c-CLIVE
p-(A hushed, reverent whisper)
d-A permanent resolution. My God. It's the third act.

a-Nigel stares at Finchley, his mind struggling to process the words.

c-NIGEL
d-Retired? Sir, I'm not sure I understand the... operational parameters.

c-SIR DEREK FINCHLEY
p-(Looking him dead in the eye)
d-I think you do, Nigel.

a-The truth lands. Nigel feels the blood drain from his face. He looks physically ill.

c-NIGEL
p-(Shaking his head, slowly)
d-No. Sir, with respect... that's not... that is not what we do. We are an intelligence service, not... not that.

c-CLIVE
p-(Interrupting, his mind already racing)
d-It's a question of methodology, Nigel! A final exit. It requires... artistry. A performance piece. Something public, but misdirecting. A charity concert, perhaps? The dramatic irony would be... sublime.

a-Nigel stares at Clive, horrified. Clive isn't seeing a man; he's seeing a plot point.

c-NIGEL
p-(To Finchley, pleading)
d-Sir Derek. This is assassination.

a-He says the word. The ugly, simple truth that Finchley's elegant euphemisms were designed to hide. The word hangs in the dead air of the room.

a-Finchley's pleasant mask cracks, just for a second. His eyes turn to steel.

c-SIR DEREK FINCHLEY
d-This is a royal directive, Mr. Finch. This is not a request. It is not a debate. It is an order. Are you a loyal servant of the Crown, or are you not?

a-The threat is absolute, unspoken but perfectly clear.

c-NIGEL
d-I am a loyal servant. But this is... wrong.

c-SIR DEREK FINCHLEY
p-(Leaning forward, his voice a silken threat)
d-What is 'wrong' is a matter for philosophers. We are professionals. You have a few years left until your pension. One would hate to see such a long and... adequate career end on a note of insubordination. Consider your options. Carefully.

a-He stands, straightening his suit. The briefing is over.

c-SIR DEREK FINCHLEY (CONT'D)
d-I expect a preliminary plan on my desk by Monday.
p-(He looks at Clive)
d-Something... creative.

a-He exits, closing the door behind him with a soft CLICK.

a-Clive immediately pulls out a notebook and starts sketching frantically, muttering to himself.

c-CLIVE
d-The stage... the lighting... a distraction in the crowd... it has to be a masterpiece...

a-Nigel doesn't move. He sits at the table, utterly defeated. The bumbling comedy is over. He is now the partner of a killer-in-waiting, and an accessory to a state-sanctioned murder.

a-His face is a portrait of a man trapped between his duty, his pension, and a conscience he never knew he had until this exact moment. The path forward contains only terrible choices.

t-FADE OUT.
