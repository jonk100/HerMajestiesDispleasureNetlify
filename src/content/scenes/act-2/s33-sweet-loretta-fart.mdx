t-FADE IN:

s-INT. APPLE STUDIOS - BASEMENT - DAY (JANUARY 27, 1969)

a-The same space, but it feels completely different now. There's energy here. Purpose. Joy.

a-JOHN LENNON (28), PAUL MCCARTNEY (26), GEORGE HARRISON (25), and RINGO STARR (28) are locked in, working on "Get Back." BILLY PRESTON (23) is at the electric piano, now fully part of the sound.

a-They've been at this for hours, trying to nail the perfect take. But it's not frustrating - it's fun. They're experimenting, laughing, goofing around between takes.

a-GEORGE MARTIN and GLYN JOHNS watch from the control room, making notes, adjusting levels.

c-PAUL
p-(to the band)
d-Let's try varying the tempo a bit. Just slightly.

a-They launch into another version. It's fast, loose. Paul starts singing the first verse in mock Japanese, throwing in phrases from "Rowan & Martin's Laugh-In."

c-PAUL (CONT'D)
p-(singing)
d-Sock it to me!

a-Everyone laughs. The take falls apart, but nobody cares.

c-GEORGE
p-(grinning)
d-Try it again, but slower this time.

a-Another take. John experiments with a different guitar solo. It's getting closer. You can feel it.

c-PAUL
p-(after they finish)
d-Nearly!

a-They're close. Everyone can feel it. This is the one.

a-John leans into the microphone, and with perfect Liverpudlian deadpan, delivers the line:

c-JOHN
d-Sweet Loretta Fart, she thought she was a cleaner, but she was a frying pan... picks with his fingers.

a-The room erupts in laughter. Paul is doubled over. George is shaking his head, grinning. Ringo taps his sticks together, waiting.

c-PAUL
p-(still laughing)
d-Right, let's do it.

a-They count in. And this time, everything clicks.

a-The intro crashes in - that iconic opening chord, Ringo's drum fill. Paul's voice, strong and confident. John's guitar cutting through. George's wah-wah solo that sounds effortless. Billy's piano making it all come together.

a-This is it. This is THE take.

a-They're all locked in, smiling as they play. Paul and John catch each other's eyes during a harmony - for a moment, they're just two kids from Liverpool making music together.

a-The song builds to the ending. The iconic "Oooh" from Paul.

a-And then... nothing. Silence.

a-Ringo forgot to come back in.

c-GEORGE
p-(after a beat)
d-We missed that end, didn't we?

a-Everyone looks at each other. In the control room, George Martin leans into the talkback.

c-GEORGE MARTIN
d-I thought you were going on. Do you want to end it like that?

c-RINGO
p-(practical)
d-Just plug it on – the best end we did.

a-A moment of consideration. Then nods all around. They know what they've got - the perfect take, even with the flubbed ending. They can fix it later.

c-PAUL
p-(grinning)
d-That's it. That's the one.

c-JOHN
p-(to Billy)
d-Beautiful, Bill.

a-Billy beams. He's just played on a Beatles single.

a-But they're not done celebrating. Someone suggests they do it again - this time in German.

a-What follows is pure Beatles chaos. Mock German lyrics throughout. Paul throwing in a phrase: "Yah, that's good, Jackie!" referencing Jackie Lomax. The final verse in terrible French.

a-They're celebrating. The pressure's off. They've got their single. Now they can just have fun.

a-In the control room, Glyn Johns is shaking his head, smiling. He's been mixing their takes overnight for days. He knows what he heard - they've just recorded something special.

a-The German version devolves into laughter. They finish with a flourish, instruments crashing to a halt.

c-PAUL
p-(to everyone)
d-Right then. We're getting somewhere.

c-JOHN
p-(lighting a cigarette)
d-About bloody time.

a-But he's smiling. They're all smiling.

a-For the first time since Twickenham, The Beatles look like a band again. Not four people trapped in a cold studio, but four musicians who chose to make music together.

a-Billy Preston watches them, still amazed to be here. George catches his eye and gives him a nod - thank you.

a-The cameras capture it all. Not dissolution this time. Creation.

t-FADE TO BLACK.
