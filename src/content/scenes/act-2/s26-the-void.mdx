s-INT.INDICA GALLERY – NIGHT

a-A stark white gallery space filled with aggressively incomprehensible art.
a-A rusted bicycle wheel hangs from the ceiling.
a-A neat pile of bricks sits on the floor, labeled.
a-The crowd is young, stoned, and wearing sunglasses indoors.

a-JOHN LENNON wanders through the exhibit.
a-Slightly high. Deeply unimpressed.
a-He stops in front of a large canvas painted entirely black.

a-He stares at it for a long beat.

c-JOHN
d-Well. It’s dark, isn’t it?

a-CLIVE BARROW slides into frame beside him.
a-He wears a black turtleneck, a beret, and tinted spectacles.
a-He looks like a parody of a European intellectual assembled from secondhand rumors.

c-CLIVE
p-(preposterous, inconsistent German accent)
d-I am Klaus. Klaus… von… Klaus. Critic. Visionary. I have followed your work, Herr Lennon.

c-JOHN
d-Have you? Which bit? The “Yeah Yeah Yeah” bit or the bit where I shake my head?

c-CLIVE
d-Pah! Zat is commerce... for zee little girls. I speak of zee noise... zee feedback. The screaming of the guitar.

a-John’s mouth twitches. A laugh he refuses to give.

c-JOHN
d-And what’s that get you, then? Apart from tinnitus.

a-Clive leans in, conspiratorial.

c-CLIVE
d-The others… the cute one, the quiet one, the drummer… Zay are anchors. Zay.. drag you down into the ocean of mediocrity.

a-John narrows his eyes.
a-He doesn’t object. He considers.

c-JOHN
d-Bit harsh on Ringo.

c-CLIVE
d-You are a revolutionary, ja? An iconoclast! Why do you sing of holding hands? You should sing of tearing down the structures. You should destroy the song from the inside.

a-John looks again at the black canvas.
a-As if it might finally confess what it is.

c-JOHN
d-The funny bit is—
p-(beat)
d-I do say things. People just… take the wrong bit.

c-CLIVE
p-(gleeful)
d-Yes! You give zee world a match and zey light zee wrong room on fire.

a-Clive taps the air with two fingers, conducting an invisible choir.

c-CLIVE
d-You do not fight zee newspapers. Zey are too stupid. Zey eat your words and zey make new words.
d-So. You do not give zem explanations.
d-You give zem… echoes.

c-JOHN
d-Echoes.

c-CLIVE
d-Zee perfect outrage is not shouted by you.
d-It is shouted by… respectable mouths.
d-Husbands. Mothers. Priests.
p-(a small, pleased nod)
d-Ordinary people. Zey write in. Zey beg for punishment.

a-John studies him. This is absurd.
a-And yet—

c-JOHN
d-You’re telling me I should get vicars to do my arguing.

c-CLIVE
p-(dead serious)
d-I am telling you zee vicar is already arguing.
d-He just needs a sentence.

a-John looks back at the black canvas.
a-The idea is already forming. Not a plan—an appetite.

c-JOHN
d-Destroying the song…

c-CLIVE
p-(whispering, intense)
d-Leave zee structure. Embrace zee chaos. Zeh Beatles are a cage, John Lennon. A golden cage. But Klaus sees zeh bird who wishes to fly.

a-John nods slowly.

c-JOHN
d-You’re a bit weird, Klaus.

c-CLIVE
p-(bowing slightly)
d-Thank you.

a-John starts to walk, then turns back.

c-JOHN
d-Where you from, anyway?

c-CLIVE
p-(beat)
d-Germany.

c-JOHN
d-Which part.

c-CLIVE
d-Zee... main part.

c-JOHN
d-But you might be right. About the chaos bit.

a-John walks away, thoughtful.
a-The black painting reflects faintly in his glasses.

a-Clive watches him go.
a-He pulls a small notebook from his pocket and writes neatly.

a-“SUBJECT RECEPTIVE TO NIHILISM. ACCENT FLAWLESS.”
