t-FADE IN:

s-INT. BUCKINGHAM PALACE PRIVATE STUDY - DAY (LATE 1966)

a-The masculine sanctuary of dark wood and leather. PRINCE PHILIP (45) stands impatiently by the window. LORD MOUNTBATTEN (66) sits at a large desk, reviewing a file. The air is thick with serious purpose.

a-The door opens and PRINCESS MARGARET (36) sweeps in, holding a long cigarette holder and radiating an aura of magnificent boredom.

c-PRINCESS MARGARET
d-Dickie. Philip. Still huddled over your little pop group? Honestly, the country is falling to bits and you two are fretting over four boys who look like they've wandered out of a train station cafeteria.

a-Mountbatten doesn't look up.

c-MOUNTBATTEN
d-Your Royal Highness. We were just reviewing the successful amplification of the... "Jesus" affair.

a-Margaret exhales a plume of smoke — amused, contemptuous.

c-PRINCESS MARGARET
d-Oh, that business. Terribly dreary. Americans screaming scripture at Liverpudlians.
p-(shrugs)
d-It's like tossing pearls into a crowd and hoping someone downmarket catches them.

a-Philip turns, irritation rising.

c-PRINCE PHILIP
d-This is a matter of national dignity, Margaret, not a West End show.

a-Margaret smirks.

c-PRINCESS MARGARET
d-My dear Philip — the monarchy is a show. We simply pretend it isn't. You should try it sometime.

a-She saunters to the desk, picks up a file as though it might be contagious.

c-PRINCESS MARGARET (CONT'D)
d-You're all obsessed with the angry one. But you're missing the opportunity sitting right under your perfectly shaped noses. The other one — the agreeable, eager little puppy dog.

a-Mountbatten looks up.

c-MOUNTBATTEN
d-McCartney? A comformist. Hardly a threat.

a-He waves a hand dismissively, but Margaret laughs — low and wicked.

c-PRINCESS MARGARET
d-Exactly. A conformist is a creature of appetite. Praise, status, approval... dangle a bit of refinement and they'll crawl straight toward it.
p-(taps ash elegantly)
d-Someone at dinner last week was cooing about his new film score. Very proud of himself, apparently. It was all so frightfully provincial. You could almost smell the factory soot.

a-Philip scoffs.

c-PHILIP
d-A film score? He's convinced himself he's a real composer now?

c-PRINCESS MARGARET
d-It's sweet, really. They want so badly to be embraced by the very world they insist they're rebelling against.
p-(tilts her head)
d-Why not give him the embrace he's desperate for? Have one of your little well-trained men at the Times write a glowing review. Praise his "masterful orchestration." Compare him to Noël Coward. Use words like "sophisticated" and "mature".

a-Mountbatten's eyebrow lifts. Now she has him.

c-MOUNTBATTEN
d-You're suggesting we weaponize his ambition.

c-PRINCESS MARGARET
d-I'm suggesting we encourage the delusion. Give him everything he thinks he deserves.
p-(she takes a long drag from her cigarette)
d-Call his little composition "astonishingly sophisticated." Say he shows "the promise of a composer of real breeding."

a-She lets that sink in for a beat.

c-PRINCESS MARGARET (CONT'D)
d-Imagine how Lennon will respond when his partner becomes the establishment's new pet. That sort of jealousy is practically ethnic to the northern temperament.

a-Philip's eyes flick upward at her phrasing — shocked, but amused.

c-PRINCE PHILIP
d-Quite vicious, Margaret, even for you.

c-PRINCESS MARGARET
p-(pleasantly)
d-I'm doing my part for Crown and country, Philip. Sometimes all one requires is vanity and a match.

a-She glides toward the door.

c-PRINCESS MARGARET (CONT'D)
d-Now if you'll excuse me, all this national service has left me parched.

a-She exits in a sweep of smoke and silk as Philip and Mountbatten exchange a look.

c-MOUNTBATTEN
d-I'll have Finchley assign a cultural asset at the Sunday papers.

c-PRINCE PHILIP
p-(quiet, calculating)
d-See that you do.
