t-FADE IN:

s-INT. APPLE STUDIOS - BASEMENT - DAY (JANUARY 22, 1969)

a-A different space entirely from Twickenham. Smaller, warmer. The basement of 3 Savile Row. Equipment is more cramped but feels more intimate. This is their space.

a-GEORGE HARRISON (25) is back. He's been back for two days, since the move to Apple Studios. But the atmosphere is still tentative, careful. Everyone walking on eggshells.

a-JOHN LENNON (28), PAUL MCCARTNEY (26), and RINGO STARR (28) are working through "I've Got A Feeling" but something's missing. The energy isn't there.

a-YOKO ONO (36) sits nearby. GEORGE MARTIN watches from the control area. MICHAEL LINDSAY-HOGG's cameras are still rolling.

a-They finish a run-through. It's... fine. Just fine.

a-Then GEORGE looks up, sees someone at the door.

a-BILLY PRESTON (23), impossibly young, impossibly talented, stands there with a huge smile. He's in London touring with Ray Charles.

c-GEORGE
p-(genuine warmth breaking through)
d-Billy!

a-George crosses to him, grabs his arm.

c-GEORGE (CONT'D)
d-Remember Billy? Here he is.

a-He practically drags Billy into the studio. The energy shifts immediately - George has brought a guest, and suddenly everyone has to be on their best behavior.

c-JOHN
p-(to Billy, enthusiastic)
d-Every number's got a piano part. And normally we overdub it. But this time we wanna do it live.

c-BILLY
p-(excited)
d-Yeah. That'd be nice.

c-JOHN
d-I mean, just live to ourselves... Straight off, one number after the other. And that means having somebody in on it.

c-GEORGE
d-If you'd like to do that you're welcome.

c-BILLY
d-Sure. Beautiful.

c-JOHN
d-Right. And then you'd be on the album.

c-BILLY
p-(can't believe it)
d-You're kidding.

a-Billy looks around at The Beatles - the actual Beatles - inviting him to play on their album.

c-JOHN
d-Well, that's good then. We've taped a few. The thing is to get some tapes made of what we've done, and let him have a listen, take 'em home at night.

c-GEORGE
p-(knowing better)
d-He'll probably pick them up much quicker hearing us play 'em.

c-PAUL
d-Yeah, just rehearsing them.

a-John spots George Martin in the control room.

c-JOHN
d-Have you met Billy, George?

a-GEORGE MARTIN (43) comes over, extends his hand.

c-GEORGE MARTIN
d-How do you do, Billy?

c-JOHN
d-That's George Martin, our A&R man. That's Billy. We played with him in Hamburg. He was backing Little Richard.

c-PAUL
p-(with a nostalgic smile)
d-In the old days.

a-Billy sits at the electric piano. There's a moment of anticipation. The Beatles haven't sounded right in weeks. Can this really help?

c-PAUL (CONT'D)
d-Let's try "I've Got A Feeling."

a-They count it in.

a-And something magical happens.

a-Billy's fingers find the keys. The electric piano cuts through the arrangement like sunlight through clouds. His playing is joyful, effortless, perfect.

a-Paul and John sing together. George's guitar finds its groove. Ringo locks in.

a-For the first time in weeks - maybe months - The Beatles sound like The Beatles.

a-They're all smiling. Actually smiling. Paul catches John's eye and grins. George is nodding along, looking relieved. Even Ringo, usually so steady, has a huge smile on his face.

a-The song builds, and Billy just floats around their parts, filling in the spaces, making everything better.

a-When they finish, there's a moment of stunned silence.

a-Then JOHN turns to Billy, beaming.

c-JOHN
d-You're in the group!

a-Everyone laughs. Real laughter. The kind they haven't had in this whole ordeal.

c-PAUL
p-(grinning)
d-Do you play violin?

a-More laughter.

a-Billy looks at them, eyes wide as saucers, hardly believing what just happened.

a-In the control room, GLYN JOHNS is already making notes. This is it. This is the sound.

a-GEORGE HARRISON watches Billy at the keyboard, watches his bandmates smiling, and there's something in his expression - pride, relief, maybe a little sadness too. He brought Billy here. He saved the sessions. But he knows it took an outsider to make them behave.

a-Later, George will say to the camera: "Having this fifth person was just enough to cut the ice that we'd created among ourselves. Billy didn't know all the politics and the games that had been going on, so in his innocence he got stuck in and gave an extra little kick to the band."

a-But right now, in this moment, they're just playing music together. And for the first time in a long time, it feels good.

a-They count in another song. "Don't Let Me Down."

c-JOHN
p-(to Billy, encouraging)
d-Hit it, Bill!

a-Billy launches into a solo. John grins.

c-JOHN (CONT'D)
d-Oh, yeah! One more!

a-The cameras capture it all. The Beatles, energized. Playing together. Actually enjoying themselves.

a-It won't solve everything. The underlying problems are still there. But right now, with Billy Preston at the electric piano, making the songs come alive, it feels like maybe - just maybe - The Beatles can still be The Beatles.

t-FADE OUT.
