SCENE START

Revolver Sessions

FADE IN:

INT. EMI STUDIOS, STUDIO TWO - NIGHT (APRIL 1966)

The legendary studio has been transformed into a mad scientist's laboratory. The air is thick with cigarette smoke and the smell of hot vacuum tubes.

JOHN LENNON (25), eyes wide with manic energy, is directing chaos. He stands over a dozen tape recorders, each playing a short, strange loop of sound— a distorted laugh, a seagull's cry, a sitar phrase played backwards.

  JOHN
  (to a young studio engineer)
  Right, on my signal, you push that fader up. Paul, you ready on the wine glass?

PAUL MCCARTNEY (23), ever the professional, holds a pencil poised over a half-full glass of red wine, ready to create a specific ringing tone. He nods, a focused smile on his face.

GEORGE HARRISON (23) sits cross-legged on a rug, his sitar across his lap, quietly observing the controlled chaos with the look of a man who finally feels at home.

RINGO STARR (25) sits behind his drum kit, a bemused but supportive grin on his face. He taps out a steady, hypnotic beat. Another night at the office.

  PAUL
  (laughing with scepticism)
  Sounds like a thousand seagulls being tortured.

  JOHN
  (gleefully)
  Exactly! It's the sound of the void, Macca! The sound of what happens after you die! Or before you're born. Haven't decided yet.

The control room door opens and BRIAN EPSTEIN (31) enters. He's impeccably dressed in a dark suit, a stark contrast to the band's casual attire. He looks like a visiting headmaster stepping into the art room during a finger-painting session.

He stands for a moment, watching the scene. He's here to discuss the upcoming American tour, but the words die on his lips.

  BRIAN
  (to the engineer, quietly)
  What are they... doing?

  ENGINEER
  (without looking up)
  Making the tape loops for "Tomorrow Never Knows," Mr. Epstein. John wants it to sound like the Dalai Lama singing from a mountaintop.

Brian nods, though he clearly doesn't understand. He sees Paul, George, and Ringo all holding pencils, ready to manipulate the tape machines. They are a single unit, a four-headed creative organism operating on a level he can't access.

  JOHN
  Okay... NOW!

On his cue, everyone pushes faders and starts their machines. A cacophony of sound erupts—alien, terrifying, and exhilarating.

Through the chaos, Ringo's drumming remains the solid, unwavering heartbeat. Paul, despite his teasing, is completely committed, his brow furrowed in concentration. George closes his eyes, meditating on the sound.

Brian watches them, a complicated expression on his face. It's pride, mixed with a profound sense of obsolescence. He came here to talk about logistics, contracts, television appearances—the world outside this room. But he can see with painful clarity that their world is now inside this room.

He turns to leave, unnoticed by the band.

  PAUL
  (shouting over the noise)
  Try the seagull one again! Slow it down a bit!

John gives him a thumbs-up, his face ecstatic.

Brian pauses at the door, looks back one last time. They don't need him for this. For the first time, he understands that his job is no longer to build their career, but merely to manage the fallout from their genius.

He quietly closes the door, leaving them to their creation. The camera stays inside the studio, moving between the four of them, a tight, focused unit, inventing a new language together, completely oblivious to the world outside—and to the man who brought them there, now walking away down a long, empty corridor.
