s-INT. MI5 SURVEILLANCE VAN - DAY

a-Close on reel-to-reel tape recording. Audio from Twickenham plays faintly - the sound of The Beatles arguing, then trying to play, then arguing again.

a-NIGEL FINCH and CLIVE BARROW sit in the cramped van, surrounded by surveillance equipment. CLIVE takes notes while NIGEL listens through headphones.

c-CLIVE
p-(writing)
d-Subject McCartney shows increased anxiety about project completion. Possible leadership stress.

c-NIGEL
p-(removing headphones)
d-We need to be more precise in our classifications. McCartney isn't just showing leadership stress. He's functioning as the lead ideologue of the group.

a-CLIVE looks up from his notes, confused.

c-CLIVE
d-Ideologue? He's just anxious about the TV special. They're supposed to deliver an album and a film in three weeks.

c-NIGEL
p-(patiently, as if explaining to a child)
d-That's exactly what an ideologue does, Clive. He's the one pushing the agenda, maintaining the structure, enforcing the narrative. He's the keeper of the flame.

c-CLIVE
p-(skeptical)
d-Or he's the one who actually wants to finish the project. Lennon seems more interested in provocation than productivity.

c-NIGEL
p-(shaking head)
d-Lennon is the spiritual leader, the charismatic figure. But McCartney is the one who actually makes things happen. He's the organizational core. Without him, the whole operation collapses.

a-CLIVE makes a note, then pauses.

c-CLIVE
d-What about Harrison? He's barely said anything all day.

c-NIGEL
p-(listening to headphones again)
d-He's in the withdrawal phase. Classic psychological response to group pressure. He's either going to break completely or emerge as a counter-force. We should monitor his movements more closely.

c-CLIVE
p-(writing)
d-Right. Withdrawal phase. Not just sulking.

c-NIGEL
d-Precisely. Everything has to be properly categorized. That's how we understand the threat.

a-They sit in silence for a moment, listening to the faint sound of music from the studio.

c-CLIVE
p-(after a moment)
d-Do you think they know we're here?

c-NIGEL
p-(dryly)
d-Of course not. They're too busy being The Beatles to notice anything else.

a-He adjusts his headphones, settles in for more surveillance. The bureaucracy continues, categorizing everything while missing the point entirely.

t-FADE OUT.
