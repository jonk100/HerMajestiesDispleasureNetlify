t-FADE IN:

s-INT. TWICKENHAM FILM STUDIOS - DAY

a-The Beatles are gathered around the piano, trying to work out a harmony. PAUL is demonstrating something, his voice patient but strained.

c-PAUL
p-(singing)
d-Get back, get back, get back to where you once belonged...

a-He looks at JOHN, expecting him to join in. But JOHN doesn't respond immediately. Instead, he glances over at YOKO, who sits quietly on a nearby chair.

a-She doesn't say anything. She doesn't gesture. She just meets his eyes, gives a small, almost imperceptible nod. Grounding him.

a-Only then does JOHN turn back to PAUL and join the harmony. His voice is clear but distant.

c-JOHN
p-(singing with Paul)
d-Get back, get back...

a-PAUL notices the glance to YOKO. His expression tightens slightly. He sees it as defiance - John checking with his "controller" before participating.

c-PAUL
p-(trying to keep his voice even)
d-Right. Now if we could all do that together...

a-They try again. This time, GEORGE joins in on harmony. But PAUL's eyes keep flicking to JOHN and YOKO.

a-A few minutes later, they're arguing about a chord change. PAUL wants it one way, JOHN another.

c-PAUL
p-(frustrated)
d-It just doesn't work that way, John. The resolution is wrong.

c-JOHN
p-(starting to get angry)
d-Maybe that's the point! Maybe it's not supposed to resolve!

a-JOHN starts to say more, but stops. He looks over at YOKO again. Same small nod. Same grounding moment.

a-This time PAUL can't hide his reaction.

c-PAUL
p-(coldly)
d-Does she need to approve everything you say?

a-The temperature drops. GEORGE and RINGO exchange glances.

c-JOHN
p-(quietly, after looking at YOKO again)
d-I'm just trying to find the right words, Paul.

c-PAUL
p-(bitterly)
d-Are they your words or hers?

a-JOHN doesn't answer. He just looks at YOKO, and in that moment, PAUL's resentment becomes clear. It's not really about YOKO. It's about losing his creative partner, his other half. YOKO is just the mirror reflecting what PAUL can't accept: JOHN has found a different way to survive.

a-JOHN's distance isn't cruelty. It's survival. And PAUL's anger isn't about YOKO. It's about displacement.

t-FADE OUT.
