t-FADE IN:

s-INT. TWICKENHAM FILM STUDIOS - LATER

a-A different atmosphere. The tension has eased. PAUL is actually being collaborative, not directive. JOHN is engaged without sarcasm.

a-They're working on "Get Back" again, but this time it feels like the old Beatles. They're laughing, trying ideas, building on each other's contributions.

c-PAUL
p-(genuinely amused)
d-What if we did the backing vocals like... (sings in exaggerated Elvis voice) "Get back, Loretta..."

a-JOHN cracks up, picks up the joke.

c-JOHN
p-(in terrible country accent)
d-Get back to where you once belonged, little doggie!

a-Even GEORGE is smiling, adding guitar licks that complement the joke. RINGO is grinning behind his drums. YOKO watches from the side, a small smile on her face.

a-For a moment, it's perfect. It's why they became a band. The joy, the humor, the shared language.

c-GEORGE
p-(still smiling)
d-You know, this could work. The country thing.

c-PAUL
p-(enthusiastic)
d-Right! We should lean into that. Make it authentic.

a-Then it happens. PAUL's director mode kicks in. Not cruelly, just reflexively.

c-PAUL
p-(to George)
d-But maybe less twang on the guitar. Keep it clean. And Ringo - simpler on the hi-hat. Just quarter notes.

a-The shift is immediate. JOHN's smile fades. GEORGE's expression goes from relaxed to resigned.

c-JOHN
p-(flatly)
d-Right. Quarter notes.

c-PAUL
p-(doesn't notice the change)
d-And George, maybe we could try the solo without so many notes. Just the melody.

a-GEORGE looks at PAUL. Really looks at him. And in that moment, he realizes: this will never stop.

a-Even when things are good, even when they're laughing, even when it's working - PAUL will always revert to this. The directing, the controlling, the assumption that he knows best.

a-GEORGE doesn't argue. He doesn't protest. He just nods slowly.

c-GEORGE
p-(quietly)
d-Right. Less notes.

a-But his eyes have changed. The brief hope has died. He's not angry anymore. He's made his decision.

c-PAUL
p-(oblivious, back to being enthusiastic)
d-Great! Let's try it again!

a-They play the song again. But the joy is gone. It's work now. And GEORGE plays his part correctly, cleanly, without the twang, without the extra notes.

a-He's already gone.

t-FADE OUT.
