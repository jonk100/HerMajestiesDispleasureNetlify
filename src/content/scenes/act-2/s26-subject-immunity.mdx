t-FADE IN:

s-INT. ABBEY ROAD STUDIOS LOUNGE - DAY (MARCH 1969)

a-The comfortable retreat. Worn leather furniture, gold records, tall windows. The space feels familiar but tense.

a-JOHN LENNON (28) and PAUL MCCARTNEY (26) sit in armchairs, their body language rigid. On a side table between them sits a delicate china teacup, steam rising from the amber liquid. It's positioned perfectly to be in John's reach.

c-PAUL
p-(quietly, controlled)
d-We can't just... abandon everything we've built, John. The fans, the music, the—

c-JOHN
p-(interrupting, weary)
d-The what, Paul? The machine? The bloody circus?

t-CUT TO:

s-INT. MI5 SURVEILLANCE VAN - CONTINUOUS

a-CLIVE BARROW (45) leans into his equipment, eyes gleaming. NIGEL FINCH (52) reads a file, unimpressed.

c-CLIVE
p-(into his radio, a hushed whisper)
d-The catalyst is in the pot. Once ingested, the psychoactive compound will amplify his existing paranoia and creative anxieties. It will shatter the group's cohesion from the inside.

c-NIGEL
p-(without looking up)
d-Or he'll just write another song about a walrus.

a-Clive glares at him, then puts his headphones back on, focusing intently.

t-BACK TO:

s-INT. ABBEY ROAD STUDIOS LOUNGE - CONTINUOUS

c-PAUL
p-(leaning forward)
d-The band. Our band.

a-John looks away, his jaw tight. The teacup sits untouched.

c-JOHN
p-(after a pause)
d-Maybe it's time to admit it's not our band anymore. Maybe it never was.

a-The door bursts open. RINGO STARR (29) enters, radiating uncomplicated good humor.

c-RINGO
p-(grinning)
d-Blimey, you two. Give it a rest. Like an old married couple, you are.

a-Ringo spots the teacup. His face lights up.

c-RINGO (CONT'D)
d-Ooh, is that for anyone? Parched, I am.

a-Before either John or Paul can respond, Ringo plucks the teacup from its saucer.

t-CUT TO:

s-INT. MI5 SURVEILLANCE VAN - CONTINUOUS

a-Clive hears this and his body goes rigid.

c-CLIVE
p-(whispering urgently)
d-Non-target approaching the delivery mechanism. Abort! ABORT!

a-But it's too late. Through his headphones, he hears Ringo take a long, satisfying sip.

c-RINGO (V.O.)
p-(through the radio, cheerful)
d-That's nice. Bit lemony. The steam's making lovely patterns...

a-Clive's face cycles through confusion, realization, then pure, silent rage. He rips the headset off with a CLATTER.

c-CLIVE
p-(exploding)
d-Subject Immunity! It's scientifically impossible!

a-He gestures wildly at the radio equipment.

c-CLIVE (CONT'D)
p-(ranting)
d-Five years of psychological profiling! It's supposed to induce ego fragmentation! Paranoia! Not... not a bloody tea review!

c-NIGEL
p-(dryly, not looking up from his file)
d-He seems content.

c-CLIVE
p-(desperately)
d-But the operational parameters! The psycho-chemical matrix! The—

c-NIGEL
p-(sighing)
d-Clive.

a-Nigel opens a thick file folder labeled "STARR, R." He flips to a page that's mostly blank.

c-NIGEL (CONT'D)
p-(reading aloud)
d-"Subject displays a baseline level of contentment impervious to psycho-chemical manipulation. Possesses no exploitable ego or anxieties. Recommendation: ignore."

a-He closes the file with the finality of a judge's gavel.

c-NIGEL (CONT'D)
p-(matter-of-factly)
d-He's immune, Clive. Some people just are.

a-Clive slumps in his chair, defeated. The sophisticated technology around him suddenly looks like expensive junk.

a-Nigel makes a small notation in his logbook. Outside, London continues its day, completely unaware that a government conspiracy has just been neutralized by a thirsty drummer.
