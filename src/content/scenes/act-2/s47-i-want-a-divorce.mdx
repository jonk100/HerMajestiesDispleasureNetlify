t-FADE IN:

s-INT. APPLE CORPS BOARDROOM - DAY (NOVEMBER 1969)

a-The room is stylish, expensive, and cold. The four Beatles are assembled around a large, polished table. The mood is thick with dread.

a-PAUL (27) paces at the head of the table, radiating a tense, aggressive energy. In his hand is the crumpled, forged knighthood letter.

a-JOHN (29) sits opposite, utterly disengaged. He doodles on a notepad. YOKO (36) is beside him, a silent, still presence.

a-GEORGE (26) stares out the window at Savile Row, having already mentally left the room.

a-RINGO (29) sits between them all, anxiously tapping his fingers on the table, the unwilling witness to a family's collapse.

c-PAUL
p-(Stopping his pacing)
d-Right. I called this meeting because things have gone too far. There are... forces at play here. Trying to tear us apart. And we need to face it.

a-His eyes are fixed on Yoko. John doesn't look up from his doodle.

c-JOHN
p-(Muttering)
d-Here we go. St. Paul's sermon on the mount.

c-PAUL
p-(Ignoring him, his voice rising)
d-I'm serious, John! You can't see it because you're too close to it, but I can. The whispers. The outsiders. The way they're trying to turn you against me. Against us.

a-He gestures vaguely with the letter, the "evidence" for his paranoid theory. He is so full of righteous fury, he's practically shaking.

c-PAUL (CONT'D)
d-This isn't about music anymore. This is about... infiltration. And we have to fight it. We have to be a band again.

a-He looks around the table, pleading. But no one meets his eye. He's trying to rally troops who have already deserted.

a-Before Paul can present his "evidence," John slowly puts his pencil down. He looks up, not at Paul, but at the center of the table. His expression is flat, devoid of emotion.

c-JOHN
d-I'm leaving the group.

a-The words hang in the air, simple and brutal. Paul stops dead. His entire argument, his whole paranoid structure, collapses into dust.

c-PAUL
p-(Confused)
d-What? What are you talking about? We're talking about how to save it...

c-JOHN
p-(Cutting him off, still calm)
d-No, *you're* talking about how to save it. I'm not. It's over.
p-(He looks at Paul for the first time)
d-I want a divorce.

a-The room falls into a stunning, absolute silence.

a-Paul's face goes blank with shock. He came in for a fight, armed and ready, only to find the war was long over.

a-George turns from the window. A small, almost imperceptible nod. A quiet exhale of relief. He's free.

a-Ringo's face crumples. He looks utterly heartbroken.

t-CUT TO:

s-INT. MI5 SURVEILLANCE VAN - CONTINUOUS

a-NIGEL (52) and CLIVE (45) listen through their headphones.

c-CLIVE
p-(Tearing his headset off, leaping to his feet in the cramped space)
d-YES! HE SAID IT! HE SAID THE THING!
p-(He punches the air)
d-SUCCESSFUL FRACTURING! OPERATIONAL OBJECTIVE ACHIEVED! THE KLAUS METHODOLOGY WORKS!

a-Nigel doesn't move. He slowly takes off his own headphones, placing them carefully on the console. He closes his eyes, pinching the bridge of his nose. The weight of the last four years settles on him. There is no triumph on his face, only a profound, weary sadness.

t-BACK TO SCENE

a-In the boardroom, the silence stretches. Paul sinks into a chair, the crumpled letter falling from his hand onto the table. It lies there, a pathetic, meaningless prop.

c-PAUL
p-(A whisper)
d-...a divorce?

c-JOHN
p-(Standing up, Yoko rising with him)
d-It was fun while it lasted.

a-He says it without malice or sentiment. It's just a fact. He walks toward the door, not looking back. The band is already in his past.

a-Paul watches him go, completely and utterly blindsided. The real conspiracy wasn't the one he imagined. It was the one he never saw.

t-FADE OUT.
