t-FADE IN:

s-INT. TWICKENHAM FILM STUDIOS - DAY (JANUARY 10, 1969)

a-Morning. The soundstage feels different today - the tension has shifted from frustration to something darker. A decision is forming.

a-PAUL MCCARTNEY (26), JOHN LENNON (28), and RINGO STARR (28) are working on "Get Back" - trying to nail the arrangement. Paul is at the piano, enthusiastic about the song.

a-GEORGE HARRISON (25) is quiet. More than quiet - withdrawn. He sits with his guitar, but there's a distance in his eyes. This is a man who has made up his mind.

a-YOKO ONO (36) sits nearby, her usual silent presence.

c-PAUL
p-(excited)
d-We've just got to do something about this middle eight.

c-GEORGE
p-(distant)
d-Try shuffling it, the whole middle eight.

a-They work through it. This rehearsal is actually good - maybe the best version yet. For a moment, it feels like the old Beatles.

c-GEORGE (CONT'D)
p-(after they finish)
d-That's the best so far.

a-But there's no joy in his voice. Just observation.

t-CUT TO:

s-INT. TWICKENHAM FILM STUDIOS - LATER

a-The studio feels different. The air is thick with unspoken things. Everyone knows something is about to happen.

a-PAUL stands at the piano, looking at the others. He makes one last attempt.

c-PAUL
p-(quietly, almost pleading)
d-Let's just try it one more time. From the top. No talking, no arguing. Just play.

a-JOHN nods slowly, picks up his guitar. RINGO adjusts his drumsticks. GEORGE watches from the side, his guitar in its case.

c-PAUL
p-(to George)
d-George?

a-GEORGE hesitates, then walks over and picks up his guitar. The gesture is mechanical, not hopeful.

a-They start playing "Get Back." For the first few bars, it's actually good. Clean, tight, professional.

a-Then it happens. Not a big argument. Not a dramatic moment. Just... a disconnect.

a-JOHN plays a chord that doesn't quite fit. PAUL stumbles on the piano. RINGO's timing wavers. They're all hearing different songs now.

a-They stop. Not abruptly. Just... fade out. The last chord hangs in the air, wrong and unresolved.

a-No one says anything.

a-This is new. This is terrifying. The Beatles have always argued. They've always fought. But they've always been able to play. Now even that's gone.

a-The silence stretches. It's heavier than any argument they've ever had.

a-Then GEORGE speaks. His voice is calm, final.

c-GEORGE
d-See you 'round the clubs.

a-He puts his guitar down. Not angrily, not dramatically. Just... puts it down.

a-He turns and walks out. No one tries to stop him. No one argues.

a-The silence that follows is absolute. The cameras keep rolling, documenting this new horror: not the end of a fight, but the end of music itself.

t-FADE TO BLACK.
