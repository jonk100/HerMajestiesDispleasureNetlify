age:
  act_1: 42
occupation: "BBC Television Newscaster"
description: "A composite character embodying the calm, authoritative voice of the BBC in the 1960s. His dispassionate, formal delivery of the news report containing John Lennon's 'killing people' comment creates a stark contrast with the private fury it ignites in Prince Philip, serving as the sterile vessel that brings the chaos of the outside world into the palace."
