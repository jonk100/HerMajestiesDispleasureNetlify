# Maureen Cleave

A respected journalist for the London Evening Standard, Maureen Cleave represents the best of 1960s cultural journalism - intelligent, perceptive, and genuinely interested in understanding the cultural phenomena she covers rather than simply exploiting them for headlines.

## Character Overview

She recognizes The Beatles' evolution from simple pop stars to cultural figures worthy of thoughtful analysis. Her approach to interviewing is conversational and intellectually curious rather than sensationalistic.
