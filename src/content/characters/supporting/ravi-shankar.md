# Ravi Shankar

## Motivations

Ravi Shankar is motivated by a profound duty to his art and his culture. His goals are twofold: to preserve the purity and discipline of Indian classical music, and to act as a responsible bridge between the East and the West. He is not motivated by fame, pop charts, or the counter-culture movement that latches onto him. He sees the explosion of Western interest in Indian culture as both an opportunity and a grave danger, and his primary motivation is to ensure the tradition is respected, not simply consumed as a fleeting trend.

## Internal Conflict

His core conflict is the "Guru's Dilemma": How to share a deep, sacred tradition with a superficial world without it being diluted, commercialized, and ultimately destroyed? He is pleased by the earnest interest of students like George Harrison, but deeply troubled by the "hippie" movement that co-opts the sitar and other Indian cultural symbols for drug-fueled, undisciplined ends. He constantly weighs his desire to teach against his responsibility to protect his culture from caricature.

## Character Arc

Ravi Shankar's arc is that of the steadfast teacher whose influence is misinterpreted and ultimately vindicated.

**Act 1 (1965-1966): The Catalyst from Afar** - Ravi Shankar exists as a world-renowned but niche artist. His music, discovered by George Harrison, becomes the catalyst for a new sound in Western pop (*Norwegian Wood*, *Love You To*). The Committee takes note of this "foreign influence," flagging it as a potential vector for subversion long before George even meets him.

**Act 2 (1967-1969): The Misunderstood Mentor** - After meeting George, Ravi becomes his formal teacher. Their relationship is one of strict discipline and deep spiritual learning. However, from the outside, Operation Minuet sees this differently. To them, George's trip to India and his devotion to Shankar is evidence of indoctrination. They view Ravi as a potential foreign agent or, at best, an unwitting tool corrupting a national treasure. Their surveillance of him and George provides "evidence" that fuels their paranoia.

**Act 3 (1970-1971): The Transcendent Purpose** - With The Beatles dissolved, Ravi's influence on George comes to its purest fruition. He approaches George not for pop music, but for a humanitarian crisis, leading to the Concert for Bangladesh. This act of selfless musical activism is so far beyond the Committee's cynical understanding that it effectively proves their theories wrong. He has guided George not to subversion, but to a higher purpose, completely escaping the petty confines of their conspiracy.

## Psychological Profile

**Core Traits:**

- Dignified and patient
- Deeply disciplined and principled
- Possesses a quiet but immense authority
- A natural teacher, but a demanding one

**Vulnerabilities:**

- His greatest frustration and vulnerability is seeing his life's work and culture being disrespected or trivialized. The sound of a badly played sitar is a source of genuine pain for him.

## Key Relationships

### George Harrison (The Earnest Student)

Ravi sees in George a rare and genuine soul from the pop world. He feels a paternal responsibility to guide him correctly, not just in music but in life. Their relationship is the emotional and spiritual core of George's story arc, a sanctuary from the madness of The Beatles and the Committee's machinations.

### The Committee / Clive Barrow (The Suspicious Establishment)

The Committee views Ravi Shankar through a Cold War lens. They cannot comprehend a relationship based on art and spirituality. In their files (codenamed "Operation Mantra"), he is profiled as a potential "handler" or "guru" exerting undue influence. They misinterpret his teachings on discipline and detachment as anti-Western brainwashing designed to pull a Beatle out of the sphere of British cultural influence.

### The Western Counter-Culture (The Unwanted Flock)

He has a fraught relationship with the "hippie" movement. While he may appreciate their anti-war sentiment, he is dismayed by their lack of discipline and their superficial adoption of Indian spirituality. He sees them as misguided children playing with sacred things.

## Historical Timeline Context

**1965:** George Harrison first plays a sitar on *Norwegian Wood*, sparking Western interest. The Committee likely opens a preliminary file on "Eastern musical influence."

**June 1966:** George meets Ravi Shankar in London. This is a key event, marking the beginning of the formal student-teacher relationship.

**1967:** Ravi performs at the Monterey Pop Festival, an event he later expressed ambivalence about due to the drug-fueled atmosphere. For the Committee, this places him at the heart of the counter-culture they fear.

**1967-1968:** George and the other Beatles travel to India to study Transcendental Meditation with the Maharishi, but George's specific musical tutelage under Shankar is a separate, more profound thread that the Committee conflates with the general "India craze."

**1971:** Ravi approaches George about the humanitarian crisis in Bangladesh, leading to the Concert for Bangladesh. This is the culmination of their relationship, using music for a cause far beyond the scope of the conspiracy.

## Historical Accuracy Notes

**Documented Facts:**

- Ravi Shankar was a world-renowned sitar virtuoso long before meeting The Beatles.
- He was George Harrison's sitar teacher and a profound spiritual influence.
- He expressed deep reservations about the hippie movement's co-opting of Indian music and culture.
- He famously disliked his performance at Monterey Pop.
- He was the direct impetus for the Concert for Bangladesh.

**Creative Liberties:**

- Any suggestion of surveillance by MI5 or a royal committee ("Operation Mantra") is entirely fictional.
- His portrayal as a "person of interest" in a government conspiracy is imagined for the story.
- The idea that his teachings were interpreted as a form of "radicalization" by the British establishment is a narrative invention.

**Sources:**

- "Raga Mala: The Autobiography of Ravi Shankar"
- "The Beatles Anthology"
- "George Harrison: Living in the Material World" (documentary by Martin Scorsese)
- Biographies of George Harrison, such as "Here Comes the Sun" by Joshua M. Greene.

## Voice and Dialogue Notes

**Speech Patterns:**

- Speaks with precision and thoughtfulness.
- Calm, measured, and dignified tone.
- Often uses musical or spiritual metaphors (e.g., "You cannot find the note if your mind is full of noise.")
- English is fluent and articulate, with the distinct cadence of an Indian academic.

**Emotional States:**

- **Patient:** When teaching a willing student like George.
- **Frustrated:** When discussing the trivialization of his culture by the West.
- **Serene:** When playing or discussing the deep theory of his music.
- **Urgent:** The one time his calm breaks is when he speaks of the suffering in Bangladesh.

**Key Phrases/Concepts:**

- Emphasis on "discipline," "practice," "tradition."
- References to "rasa" (the emotional essence of a piece of music).
- Distinguishing between true "sadhana" (spiritual practice) and fleeting trends.

## Costume and Visual Notes

**Physical Description:**

- Slender build, warm eyes, and a gentle but commanding expression.
- Impeccable posture.

**Attire:**

- Almost always seen in traditional Indian clothing: a simple, elegant kurta and pajamas.
- In formal Western concert settings, he might wear a more ornate sherwani.
- His clothing reflects his rejection of Western pop fashion and his rootedness in his own culture.

**Symbolic Elements:**

- The Sitar: It is an extension of his body. He holds it and cares for it with reverence.
- Incense/Candles: The atmosphere around him is one of calm, focused ritual.

## Scene-Specific Notes

**First Meeting (1966):**
Ravi should be initially skeptical of the famous pop star, testing George's sincerity before agreeing to teach him. He is unimpressed by his fame, only by his humility and willingness to learn.

**Lessons in India (1967):**
Scenes should emphasize the rigor and discipline of his teaching. This is not a casual jam session. It's focused, difficult work, showing George's dedication and contrasting starkly with a montage of the chaotic, drug-fueled "Summer of Love" happening back in the West.

**Concert for Bangladesh (1971):**
Onstage, he is the picture of dignity. His opening address to the audience ("If you appreciate the tuning so much, I hope you will enjoy the playing more") should land perfectly, showcasing his gentle wit and authority. He is the event's spiritual anchor.

**Surveillance Montage:**
A scene could show the Committee's perspective: grainy, black-and-white photos of Ravi and George sitting calmly with a sitar, while a voiceover from Clive interprets it with paranoid suspicion: "He isolates the target, removes him from familiar surroundings, and begins the indoctrination process..."

This character profile establishes Ravi Shankar as a figure of immense integrity whose genuine purpose is completely misinterpreted by the story's conspirators.
