# Arthur Jenkins (The Operative)

## Motivations

Arthur is motivated by a simple, professional code: you are given a job, and you do it to the best of your ability. He is a technician, not an ideologue. He likely has no opinion on John Lennon, pop music, or the Crown's dignity. His goal is to execute a clean, successful operation as per his training. This professional pride is his sole motivation, and it is relentlessly frustrated by the chaotic incompetence of Operation Elegy.

## Internal Conflict

Arthur's conflict is between his years of professional training and the amateurish absurdity of the mission he's been assigned. He knows the equipment is substandard, the plan is theatrical nonsense, and his handler (Clive) is a dangerous fool. His struggle is to maintain his professional calm and execute his orders despite every one of his instincts telling him this is a doomed, mismanaged farce. He is a man of action forced to serve a man of bad ideas.

## Character Arc

Arthur has a brief, tragic, and darkly comic arc contained entirely within the climax. He appears as **The Professional**, a man who knows his job. He quickly becomes **The Confused Instrument**, bewildered by his handler's bizarre commands and the faulty equipment. He ends as **The Failure**, a skilled operative defeated not by the enemy, but by his own side's institutional folly. He is a pawn who is sacrificed for nothing.

## Psychological Profile

**Core Traits:**

- Methodical and calm under pressure
- Deeply practical and results-oriented
- Economical with words and movement
- Possesses a quiet, professional pride in his skills
- Deeply cynical about management

**Vulnerabilities:**

- His professionalism makes him unable to refuse a direct, albeit stupid, order.
- He is completely out of his element when dealing with artistic or theatrical concepts.
- His skills are entirely dependent on the quality of his tools and his handler, both of which are terrible.

## Key Relationships

### Clive Barrow

His handler and the source of all his professional misery. Arthur views Clive with the quiet contempt of a master craftsman forced to take instructions from a delusional amateur. He follows Clive's orders but his every action and line of dialogue should convey his deep skepticism of Clive's "artistic" methodology.

### Nigel Finch

Arthur likely never interacts with Nigel, but Nigel represents the kind of competent, weary professional Arthur would understand and respect. They are two sides of the same coin: career civil servants trapped in an absurd situation, though Arthur's role is far more perilous.

## Voice and Dialogue Notes

**Speech Patterns:**

- Clipped, concise, and technical. Uses military or professional jargon.
- He reports problems; he does not express feelings.
- His dialogue is sparse. He is a man of action, not words.

**Sample Dialogue:**

- "The bracket's not flush. It's wobbling."
- "Negative visibility on the mark."
- "I don't have a clean shot."

## Visual Appearance and Costume Notes

**Physical Description:**

- 50s, physically fit but with the weary face of a man who has seen too much.
- Steady hands are his most defining feature.
- Carries himself with an understated confidence that dissolves into quiet frustration.

**Attire:**

- Dressed as an anonymous technician or roadie. Dark, practical work clothes. A boilersuit or canvas jacket.
- He is dressed to be invisible, which contrasts sharply with Clive's desire to be the center of his own drama.

## Scene-Specific Notes

**The Rafters (Scene 29):**
Arthur's performance should be a masterclass in controlled frustration. He should handle the antique rifle with professional care, but his expression should betray his deep misgivings. Every line he speaks should be a simple, factual report of a problem ("It's wobbling," "I can't see"), which serves to highlight the absurdity of Clive's grand vision. His flinch at Yoko's scream should be an involuntary, human reaction that ultimately causes the mission's failure.
