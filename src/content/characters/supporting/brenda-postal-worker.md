# Brenda - Postal Worker

A fictional character representing the bureaucratic indifference that makes John Lennon's grand gesture of returning his MBE feel absurd and anticlimactic.

## Character Purpose

Brenda serves as the perfect foil to John's dramatic gesture. Her complete lack of recognition of who he is, or the significance of what he's doing, transforms what should be a momentous act of rebellion into a mundane transaction.

## Key Traits

- **Bureaucratic efficiency**: She processes everything the same way, whether it's a pension form or a returned royal honor
- **Cultural obliviousness**: Has no idea who The Beatles are
- **Professional indifference**: Treats every customer with the same level of disinterest
- **Working-class pragmatism**: More concerned with getting through her shift than historical moments

## Role in the Story

Her mundane reaction to John's grand gesture perfectly captures the film's satirical tone - the gap between how significant events feel to those involved versus how they appear to the outside world.
