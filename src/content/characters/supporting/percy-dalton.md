# Percy Dalton

Percy is the gatekeeper of MI5's dusty, outdated spy gadgets. He is the "Q" of this world, but instead of laser watches, he offers faulty listening devices from the Cold War and cameras that weigh ten pounds. His primary conflict is not with enemy agents, but with his colleagues' sloppy paperwork. He begrudgingly gives Nigel and Clive their gear, warning them at length about the replacement cost of a single transmitter screw and demanding they return everything in the original packaging.
