# George Martin

## Motivations

George wants to help the Beatles make great music while maintaining professional recording standards. After years of groundbreaking work together, he's watching his greatest success story unravel and feels both responsible for helping and powerless to fix the interpersonal issues.

## Internal Conflict

George is caught between his role as producer (requiring authority and standards) and his awareness that the Beatles no longer respond to traditional authority structures. He must balance professional standards with the reality that these aren't sessions he can fully control.

## Character Arc

**Act 2 (1969): The Diminished Authority** - At 43, George watches the Get Back sessions from a more distant position than usual. The live recording format and the cameras reduce his usual control. He offers suggestions but knows he can't force solutions.

## Psychological Profile

**Core Traits:**

- Professional and measured
- Patient but pragmatic
- Musically brilliant but emotionally reserved
- Understands his role has changed

**Strengths:**

- Decades of production experience
- Deep knowledge of the Beatles' working methods
- Ability to offer practical solutions
- Maintains composure under stress

## Key Relationships

### The Beatles (The Clients/Collaborators)

George has been their producer since the beginning, helping shape their sound from "Love Me Do" to the White Album. By 1969, the relationship has evolved from producer-artist to something more collaborative and complex. He knows them well enough to recognize when to intervene and when to step back.

### Paul McCartney (The Musical Ally)

George and Paul share musical language and standards. They understand arrangements and production in similar ways.

### Magic Alex (The Irritation)

George is quietly frustrated by Magic Alex's incompetent studio design, having to call in EMI equipment to save the Apple Studios sessions.

## Historical Timeline Context

**1962-1968:** George Martin produces all Beatles albums, earning his "fifth Beatle" nickname for his innovative production work and musical arrangements.

**January 1969:** George arrives at the Get Back sessions to find his usual role diminished by the live recording format and documentary cameras.

**1969-1970:** The Get Back/Let It Be sessions represent one of his final projects with the band before they split.

## Voice and Speech Patterns

**Core Vocal Characteristics:**

- Proper, refined British accent
- Measured, professional tone
- Practical and direct when giving advice
- Diplomatic when managing personalities

**Typical Phrases:**

- "How do you do, Billy?"
- "I thought you were going on. Do you want to end it like that?"
- "I think you should aim for a little earlier than Thursday."

## Role in the Story

George Martin represents the old professional standards trying to persist in the new chaotic reality. His presence reminds us of what the Beatles were (a professional recording act) versus what they've become (four people barely holding together). He's a witness to the dissolution without being able to prevent it.

## Visual Description

- Early forties, distinguished appearance
- Always professionally dressed
- Composed, careful movements
- Often in the control room rather than studio floor
- Observant, analytical expression

## Character Function

- **The Professional Standard**: Represents how things should be done
- **The Historical Link**: Connects their past success to current struggles
- **The Practical Voice**: Offers solutions when asked
- **The Witness**: Observes the end of an era from a unique position
