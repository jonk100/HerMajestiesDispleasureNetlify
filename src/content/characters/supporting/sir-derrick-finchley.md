# Sir Derek Finchley

Sir Derek is a creature of Whitehall. His entire career has been built on skillfully navigating political minefields and avoiding responsibility. When he receives the directive from the Palace, he immediately identifies Nigel (reliable, nearing retirement, expendable) and Clive (enthusiastic, also expendable) as the perfect candidates. He briefs them using vague, corporate-speak, wishing them the best of luck on this "delicate but vital undertaking" before promptly going on a long-scheduled holiday, leaving no paper trail connecting him to the operation's inevitable failure.
