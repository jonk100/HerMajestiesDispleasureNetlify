## Dialogue

```text
PHILIP (reading the letter, voice clipped)
(reads)
“...protest against Britain’s involvement in the Nigeria-Biafra thing, against our support of America in Vietnam, and against Cold Turkey slipping down the charts.”

(He tosses the letter down, bristling)

PHILIP
Cold Turkey! The man returns a royal honour over a pop song. Is there any depth to which these people won’t sink?

QUEEN (quiet, measured)
He is an artist, Philip. They are meant to be dramatic.

PHILIP (tightens)
Dramatic? This is petulance. It’s a calculated insult. To the Crown. To you.

QUEEN (folds hands, gaze steady)
And yet, here we are. The institution endures. It has weathered far worse than Mr. Lennon’s gestures.

PHILIP
If we do nothing, we invite more of this. Next it will be badges, then the Order of the Garter. Where does it end?

QUEEN (dryly, a hint of wry humor)
Presumably with someone returning the crown itself, Philip. Shall we prepare a box?

(PHILIP scowls, but the Queen’s calm is unshakeable)

PHILIP
You find this amusing?

QUEEN
No. But I find it—predictable. The world is not always as we would have it. We must stand above the fray, not leap into it.

PHILIP
If you say so, Lilibet. But I’ll not have this go unanswered.

QUEEN (soft, final)
See that it does, then. Quietly, if you please.

(She turns her attention back to her correspondence. Philip hesitates, then exits, medal and letter in hand.)
