# MI5 Debriefing Room

Where catastrophe is translated into management language, and moral consequence is sanded down into “procedure.”

## Visual Description

A windowless, sterile room designed to absorb blame. Flat walls, flat light, flat color. A centered table becomes the only geometry that matters, with chairs arranged like a meeting that has already decided its outcome.

The space should feel like it was built to prevent drama — which only makes Philip’s anger more grotesque in contrast.

## Atmosphere

Clinical calm with institutional violence beneath it. Nobody raises their voice because the room doesn’t require it. It’s a place for containment, not confrontation.

## Key Set Dressing / Props

- Closed portfolios and folders as weapons of plausible deniability
- A tape recorder or dictation machine (optional, but useful texture)
- A single institutional clock
- Water glasses untouched
- Harsh overhead fluorescents with an audible hum

## Sound & Rhythm

Dialogue should land dry, with lots of air around it. The room’s hum is constant and indifferent, like the institution itself.

## Cinematic Notes

- Favor deadpan wides and minimal camera movement.
- Keep compositions symmetrical and bureaucratic.
- Let small gestures (closing a folder, straightening a paper) read as dominance.

## Story Function

This room is the system protecting itself. It reframes failure as a solvable internal process, turning real harm into paperwork. It’s the quiet mechanism that makes the later exile possible.
