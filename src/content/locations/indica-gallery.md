# Indica Gallery

A pristine, minimalist gallery space that serves as London's premier venue for avant-garde and conceptual art. This is where high art meets low espionage, as Clive Barrow's "Klaus" persona attempts to recruit Yoko Ono while Paul McCartney watches with growing suspicion.

## Visual Description

The gallery is a study in stark minimalism. Pure white walls stretch from floor to ceiling, broken only by carefully positioned artworks that seem to float in space. The polished concrete floor reflects the dramatic track lighting that creates pools of illumination around each piece.

Large windows face the street, allowing natural light to filter in during the day while making the interior visible to passersby. The space feels both intimate and exposed - perfect for quiet artistic conversations that can be observed from across the room.

A few visitors move through the space with the reverent quiet of art pilgrims, speaking in hushed tones about the deeper meanings of the conceptual works on display.

## Atmosphere

The gallery embodies intellectual pretension and authentic artistic vision in equal measure. It's a space where serious discussions about "post-war ennui" and "negative space" feel natural, where European art critics can hold forth on the futility of existence without seeming completely ridiculous.

The sterile environment creates an almost laboratory-like setting for human interaction - every gesture and conversation feels magnified and significant.

## Symbolic Function

The Indica Gallery represents the collision between authentic artistic expression and manufactured manipulation. It's where Yoko's genuine conceptual art becomes the backdrop for Clive's elaborate spy theater, while Paul's conventional worldview struggles to interpret what he's seeing. The gallery's emphasis on conceptual meaning over literal representation mirrors the story's themes of perception versus reality.
