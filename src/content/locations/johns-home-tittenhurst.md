# Tittenhurst Park (John's Home)

The visual thesis of the montage: John, finally quiet. A private English estate that reads as both sanctuary and stage-set for peace.

## Visual Description

The grounds should feel curated but not showy. Mist hangs low over clipped hedges and damp grass. The house is present in negative space more than coverage — glimpses through branches, a pale façade behind soft focus, the suggestion of rooms without entering them.

The man-made lake is the key anchor: still water, a perfectly ordinary miracle created by money and will. It should be visible from the house like a private horizon.

## Atmosphere

This is calm with a faint edge — serenity that had to be built. The air is cool and damp; birds are audible; everything is slower. The peace is real, but it feels slightly rehearsed, like John is trying it on.

## Key Set Dressing / Props

- Garden paths that invite a walk-and-talk without feeling like a park
- White clothing that catches light softly and turns bodies into silhouettes
- A distant glimpse of the house / windows (privacy implied, not explained)
- Still water (lake) as a compositional reset button

## Sound & Rhythm

Let the piano intro do most of the work. Underneath it: soft wind, distant birds, footfalls on wet ground. No city noise. No audience.

## Cinematic Notes

- Shoot like memory: long lenses, shallow depth, gentle drift.
- Avoid “estate porn.” Keep it intimate and slightly withheld.
- Use the lake as a punctuation mark — cut to stillness when the montage needs to breathe.

## Story Function

This location is John’s brief evidence that escape was possible. It sets up the cruelty of the later cut: the world can still reach you.
