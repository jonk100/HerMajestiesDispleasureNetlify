name: "Brian Epstein's Townhouse - 24 Chapel Street"
type: "interior"
description: "The impeccably decorated Belgravia townhouse of Brian Epstein. A sanctuary of sophisticated mid-century modern design, fine art, and expensive liquor, representing Epstein's attempt to impose order and class on the chaotic world of rock and roll."
mood: "Celebratory but controlled; a fragile oasis of calm."
visual_notes: "Clean lines, minimalist furniture, expensive but understated art. Not a single cushion is out of place. A stark contrast to the Beatles' own more cluttered, bohemian living spaces. The setting is a visual representation of Epstein's own personality: polished, anxious, and desperate for respectability."
