# Various Locations

A utility location entry to support montage scenes that already specify their individual locations in the script body.

## Use Case

This entry exists for scenes structured as montages/intercuts where the *scene body* names the actual spaces (hotel room, office, palace study, etc.) and the frontmatter needs a single placeholder.

Use it sparingly. When a scene primarily occurs in one place and only briefly visits another, list the primary location (or list both explicitly) instead.

## Visual Description

Not applicable as a single physical space. The “visual description” for a `various` scene is the *contrast* between the listed sub-locations.

When possible, treat the montage like a designed object: repeated framing logic, repeated gestures, repeated props, so the viewer understands the connective tissue.

## Atmosphere

The atmosphere is editorial rather than architectural. The scene should feel like it is being routed through a switchboard: clean, decisive, and slightly inhuman.

## Visual / Editorial Notes

Montage scenes in this screenplay should honor the premise’s visual clash:

- **Royal/MI5 world:** symmetry, desaturation, stillness, procedural calm.
- **Beatles world:** warmth, organic mess, breathy movement.

In intercut sequences, the edit itself can behave like surveillance:

- Hard cuts that feel like a switchboard.
- Match cuts on sound (telephones ringing) or ritual gestures (paperwork, pouring tea, placing a file).

## Practical Notes

- When using this frontmatter slug, make sure each sub-location is clearly labeled in-scene (proper `s-INT./EXT.` lines).
- If the montage spans radically different geographies, lean into contrast and clarity rather than trying to smooth it.
