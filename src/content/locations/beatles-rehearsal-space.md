# Beatles Rehearsal Space

Not the mythic stage or the pristine studio—this is where the band’s personalities rub directly against each other, with no audience to soften the edges.

## Visual Description

A working room, not a showroom.

The clutter should look accidental because it is:

- Amplifiers used as tables
- Teacups balanced in dangerous places
- Cigarette ash that never fully gets cleaned
- Cables snaking like a second nervous system

A radio sits somewhere half-heard, occasionally snapping into clarity. It’s the outside world leaking in.

## Atmosphere

Warm and human, but not cozy. This is where unfinished thoughts get played out loud, where confidence is a pose you can hear cracking.

It should carry the premise’s “Beatles world” texture: organic, fluid, slightly chaotic—yet increasingly tense as consequences begin to follow them into the room.

## Character Use

- **John Lennon** uses the space like a sparring ring: he thinks aloud, provokes, tests reality by hitting it with a joke.
- **Paul McCartney** uses it like a workshop: he’s stitching the myth together in real time, listening for what might break.

The room supports the central irony: they think they’re alone, but the story’s machinery is already listening.

## Symbolic Function

This is where language becomes dangerous precisely because it’s casual. A remark said between chords can end up as a headline, then as “evidence,” then as a reason for the state to act.

It’s the birthplace of the escalation pipeline: private intent → public interpretation.

## Key Set Dressing / Props

- Lyric sheets with crossings-out (visible indecision)
- A notebook that Paul keeps returning to
- An ashtray that’s too full (time passing)
- The radio (the world’s mouth)
