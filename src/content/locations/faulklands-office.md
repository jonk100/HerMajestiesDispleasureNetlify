type: "interior"
description: "A small, dreary administrative office in Port Stanley, Falkland Islands. The bureaucratic tomb where Nigel and Clive are exiled."
mood: "Existential dread, profound isolation, soul-crushing monotony"
visual_notes: "A room defined by miserable symmetry. Two identical grey metal desks face each other. Two identical hard-backed chairs. A single, grimy window between them looks out on a vast, empty, windswept landscape of muted greens and browns. A perpetual grey sky. The walls are bare except for a fading portrait of the Queen. A small, crackly transistor radio sits on a filing cabinet."
practical_notes: "The visual language must be pure Wes Anderson / Steven Conrad. The framing should be rigidly symmetrical to emphasize the prison-like nature of their new life. The desaturated color palette is essential. The sound design should be dominated by the constant, mournful sound of the wind outside."

# Falklands Office (Government House Annex)

The end of the line. This is the remote, forgotten administrative outpost where failed or inconvenient MI5 agents are sent to live out their careers in total obscurity. It is a place of profound and unending boredom.

## Visual Description

The office is a perfect, symmetrical prison of bureaucratic melancholy. Two identical grey metal desks face each other, each with an identical stack of shipping manifests, an identical pen, and an identical blotter. Behind them, a single, grimy window perfectly frames a vast, desolate, and utterly featureless landscape under a perpetually overcast sky. The only decoration is a faded, slightly crooked portrait of Her Majesty the Queen.

## Atmosphere

The dominant mood is one of soul-crushing monotony. The only sounds are the scratching of pens on paper, the occasional crackle from a small transistor radio, and the constant, mournful howl of the wind outside. It is a place where grand ambitions and moral crises come to die a slow, quiet death by paperwork.

## Symbolic Function

The Falklands office is the physical manifestation of bureaucratic erasure. It is the ultimate punchline to the grand, chaotic drama of the preceding five years. The story, which began in the opulent heart of the British Empire, ends in its most remote and forgotten corner. It symbolizes the complete and total victory of the institution over the individual; both Clive's manic ambition and Nigel's quiet conscience have led them to the exact same, miserable conclusion.
