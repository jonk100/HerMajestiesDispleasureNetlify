type: "interior"
description: "The MI5 equivalent of Q-Branch, but instead of cutting-edge gadgets, it's a dusty, overstuffed storeroom of obsolete Cold War technology, ruled by the perpetually irritated quartermaster, Percy Dalton."
mood: "Comedic frustration, bureaucratic dread, institutional neglect"
visual_notes: "Rows of grey metal shelving, meticulously labeled but covered in dust. Obsolete listening devices the size of shoeboxes, heavy reel-to-reel tape recorders, bulky cameras with enormous lenses. Bakelite phones and valve-based electronics. A long wooden counter serving as a fortress between Percy and the agents. The smell of old paper, ozone, and machine oil."
practical_notes: "The primary purpose is comedic contrast. It must look like the absolute opposite of a high-tech spy lab. The props should feel heavy, clunky, and genuinely from the 1950s/early 60s. This is Percy's kingdom; everything should be obsessively organized, even if it's useless."

# MI5 Q-Branch (Quartermaster Stores)

The heart of MI5's logistical operation, but a heart that stopped beating sometime around 1958. This is where Nigel and Clive come for their equipment and instead receive a lecture from Percy Dalton on the importance of proper paperwork and the folly of youth.

## Visual Description

A cathedral of obsolescence. The Q-Branch is a vast, chilly basement storeroom filled with floor-to-ceiling metal shelves. Every box and item has a neatly typed label, but everything is coated in a uniform layer of fine grey dust. This is a graveyard for ambitious technology: Bakelite phones, valve-based transmitters that hum audibly, and cameras that require a shoulder strap and a strong back.

The centerpiece is Percy's counter, a long, imposing wooden barrier that separates him from the "field agents" he so deeply distrusts. On it are his tools: meticulously organized forms, rubber stamps for every conceivable purpose, and a well-used magnifying glass for inspecting returned "assets" for microscopic damage.

## Atmosphere

The air is static with the ghosts of forgotten operations and the faint smell of machine oil and disappointment. It’s a place of profound institutional inertia, where the rules of 1955 still apply with rigid authority. The primary feeling is one of comedic despair: the agents know they need tools to do their job, but they also know that acquiring them will be a soul-crushing battle against Percy's bureaucratic fortress.

## Symbolic Function

Q-Branch is a physical manifestation of the entire conspiracy's core problem: a grand, aristocratic ambition being executed with inadequate, second-rate tools by a dysfunctional bureaucracy. It symbolizes the disconnect between the old guard (Mountbatten, Philip), who imagine a world of sleek efficiency, and the mundane reality of the civil service they command. It's a place where the thrilling fantasy of espionage dies and the boring reality of inventory management reigns supreme.
