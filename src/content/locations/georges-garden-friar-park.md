# Friar Park Gardens (George's Garden)

George’s sanctuary is not escape but practice — a garden as daily discipline, quiet humor, and private devotion.

## Visual Description

The space should feel designed and eccentric at once: formal paths that lead into odd corners, statues that look like private jokes, and garden features that suggest an estate with a long memory. Favor tactile close-ups — fingers in soil, water on leaves, sunlight catching small imperfections.

The garden reads as a world George can control without dominating: tending, pruning, adjusting, listening.

## Atmosphere

Contemplative and gently strange. It’s peaceful, but not empty — there’s a sense of ongoing work. The mood is neither rock-star retreat nor pastoral fantasy; it’s a person choosing attention.

## Key Set Dressing / Props

- Gardening tools kept simple and period-appropriate
- Statues / small visual jokes in the landscaping
- Water features or damp stone corners that catch light
- A path or hedge line that creates depth and “maze” feeling

## Sound & Rhythm

Natural sounds and small actions: clipping shears, water trickle, birds, a distant breeze. Let the montage music sit over these like a veil.

## Cinematic Notes

- Shoot like observation, not coverage.
- Use slow push-ins and shallow focus to make the world feel inward.
- Let George’s calm be unperformed — no big beat, just a moment held.

## Story Function

George’s image completes the montage argument: each Beatle finds a different kind of peace, none of it achieved through the systems that tried to control them.
