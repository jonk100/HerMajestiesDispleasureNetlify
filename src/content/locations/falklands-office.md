# Falklands Office

The joke made architectural: a punishment cell built from paperwork, symmetry, and weather.

## Visual Description

A small office rendered monumental by composition. Two identical grey metal desks face each other like dueling altars. The room is drained of personality — neutral paint, institutional furniture, a filing cabinet that might as well be a tomb.

One grimy window looks out onto an empty landscape. The outside is not “scenic.” It is simply indifferent.

## Atmosphere

Purgatorial stillness under fluorescent glare. Time moves in increments of forms completed. The air feels stale and cold, and the wind outside acts like a constant accusation.

## Key Set Dressing / Props

- Two identical desks with identical stacks of manifests
- Two identical pens placed perfectly parallel to desk edges
- Filing cabinet with a small transistor radio on top
- A mug that’s been reheated too many times
- A wall clock that seems to mock the idea of progress

## Sound & Rhythm

The wind is the score here: relentless, howling, never resolving. Inside: pen scratches, paper movement, a faint fluorescent hum, and the radio’s tinny voice puncturing the silence.

## Cinematic Notes

- Rigid symmetry in wide shots; no relief.
- Minimal coverage; hold on faces and let the joke curdle.
- Light should be harsh and unflattering, turning skin into paperwork.

## Story Function

This location is the conspiracy’s true ending: not a courtroom, not a shootout, not justice — administrative exile. It converts men into function and lets the institution remain pristine.
