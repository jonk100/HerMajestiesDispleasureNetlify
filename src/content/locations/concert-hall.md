visual_notes: "The main hall is filled with the warm colors and vibrant energy of the late 60s counter-culture. The stage is dominated by the 'PEACE' banner. Backstage is a world of organic chaos—cables, instrument cases, half-eaten food. The lighting booth and rafters are sterile, desaturated, and cold. The visual language constantly cuts between these contrasting worlds."
practical_notes: "The location must accommodate several distinct zones of action simultaneously. The audience, the stage, the wings, the lighting booth, and the high rafters are all crucial and need to feel part of the same whole, yet visually distinct in tone."

# UNICEF Concert Hall (Lyceum Theatre)

The venue for John and Yoko's "Concert for Peace," and the stage for Operation Elegy's farcical and violent climax.

## Visual Description

A classic Victorian theatre filled with the vibrant, chaotic energy of 1970. The main auditorium is a sea of young, hopeful faces, a warm and organic mass. The stage is simple, dominated by a large, hand-painted banner for UNICEF that reads "CONCERT FOR PEACE."

Backstage is a messy, lived-in world of snaking cables, flight cases, and roadies drinking tea from Styrofoam cups. It’s a space of functional, creative chaos.

High above it all are the two sterile zones of the conspiracy: the lighting booth, a humming box of precise levers and dials, and the rafters, a cold, dark cage of steel and dust.

## Atmosphere

The atmosphere is a deliberate collision of tones. On the main floor, it is joyous, hopeful, and electric. Backstage, it's professional but relaxed. In the rafters and lighting booth, it is cold, silent, and filled with a dreadful, bureaucratic tension. The sound design will be crucial, cutting from the clear, emotional music on stage to the muffled, distorted rumble heard by the operatives above.

## Symbolic Function

The concert hall is the film's ultimate battleground, where every theme collides. It is the intersection of art and power, authentic rebellion and state-sponsored conspiracy, chaotic warmth and sterile order. The physical separation of the different zones—stage, audience, rafters—visually represents the massive disconnect between the public myth of peace and love and the secret, violent reality of the forces working to undermine it.

## Key Zones (Must Read as One Building)

- **Auditorium**: warm, human, breathy. Faces. Sweat. Hope.
- **Stage**: simple geometry dominated by the banner; a place of performance and vulnerability.
- **Backstage/Wings**: functional clutter; the messy truth behind the myth.
- **Lighting Booth**: humming machinery; procedural control.
- **Rafters/Catwalks**: cold, desaturated negative space; conspiracy made architectural.

## Key Set Dressing / Props

- Hand-painted “CONCERT FOR PEACE” / UNICEF banner
- Flight cases and coiled cables as visual spaghetti
- Work lights and practicals that create cages of shadow in the rafters
- Sightlines that allow us to understand distance (and misunderstanding) between stage and operatives

## Cinematic Notes

The edit language should behave like surveillance failing:

- Clean, emotional stage coverage interrupted by harsh, utilitarian angles above.
- Muffled, distorted concert sound in the rafters contrasted with full fidelity on stage.
- Make the audience’s warmth feel like a force the conspiracy can’t calculate.
