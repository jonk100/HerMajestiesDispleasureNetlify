# Dal Lake Houseboat (Kashmir)

A floating sanctuary—beauty as an antidote to urgency.

## Visual Description

A wooden houseboat floating on still water, with mountains seated on the horizon like immovable witnesses. The light is soft and forgiving—sunset that feels earned.

Inside/outside should blur:

- Rugs and carved wood.
- Low seating.
- A quiet domestic simplicity that makes the Western concept of “status” look childish.

The lake surface reflects everything, including the figures—an image that can hold in silence.

## Atmosphere

This is the rare place in the screenplay where urgency is suspended. The sound design should feel spacious: water, distant birds, and the clean decay of sitar notes over open air.

It is the inverse of MI5 rooms that try to quantify mood. Here, mood is the point.

## Character Use

- **George Harrison** uses the houseboat as proof that another life is possible—one not built around deadlines, fans, or the Lennon–McCartney gravity well.
- **Ravi Shankar** belongs here effortlessly. His authority is calm, not inherited. His presence makes “discipline” feel like care, not control.

## Symbolic Function

The houseboat represents George’s genuine escape route—spiritual seeking that is real, not fashion.

In the premise’s power-versus-art frame, this is art and discipline as liberation. It’s also the ultimate misread for the Committee: they cannot imagine a relationship based on quiet practice, so they will file it as indoctrination.

## Key Set Dressing / Props

- Sitar resting with care (not as decoration)
- Simple tea service (not palace silver)
- A horizon line that dwarfs human plans
