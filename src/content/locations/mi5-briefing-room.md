name: "MI5 Briefing Room"
type: "interior"
description: "A soul-crushing, windowless room in the bowels of MI5 headquarters. The antithesis of Buckingham Palace's grandeur, this space is defined by its institutional drabness and the lingering scent of stale tea and disappointment."
mood: "Bureaucratic melancholy; a place where grand strategies meet grim reality."
visual_notes: "Pale yellow walls stained with age. Scuffed linoleum floors. Government-issue wooden desk and chairs. A large, poorly-erased whiteboard shows the ghost of a previous, equally uninspired operation. A single, wilting spider plant sits on a filing cabinet, a testament to faded optimism."
