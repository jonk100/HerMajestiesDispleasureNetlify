description: "The dark, dusty, and cavernous space high above the stage of the UNICEF Concert for Peace. A private, isolated world of steel beams and catwalks."
mood: "Cold, clinical, tense, detached"
visual_notes: "A world of geometric shadows and industrial textures. Steel beams create a cage-like effect. Dust motes float in the single, low-wattage work light. The vibrant sounds of the concert below feel distant and muffled. The framing should be symmetrical and claustrophobic, contrasting with the expansive stage view."
practical_notes: "This is the sniper's nest. It needs to feel both high above the action and oppressively close for the characters within it. The contrast between this cold, silent space and the warm, loud stage is the key visual dynamic of the climax."

# Concert Hall Rafters

The cold, mechanical brain of the theater, a place of wires, dust, and steel that serves as the command center for Operation Elegy's disastrous climax.

## Visual Description

High above the warmth and energy of the stage, the rafters are a different world. It is a dark, cold, and forgotten space, a geometric web of steel I-beams and rickety wooden catwalks. The only light comes from a single, bare work bulb, casting long, sharp shadows. From this vantage point, the stage below looks like a diorama, the audience a faceless mass, and the target a distant, abstract figure.

## Atmosphere

The mood is one of detached, clinical tension. The roar of the crowd is a muffled, bass-heavy rumble, a world away from the focused, whispering intensity of the operatives. It is a sterile, lonely place where a human life is meant to be reduced to a target in a foggy lens.

## Symbolic Function

The rafters represent the soulless, top-down nature of the conspiracy. The operatives are literally looking down on their target, physically and emotionally detached from the human reality of their actions. This space is the physical embodiment of the MI5 world—cold, geometric, and morally vacant—intruding upon the warm, chaotic, and vibrant world of the artists below.
