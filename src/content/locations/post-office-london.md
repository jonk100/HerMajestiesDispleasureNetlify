name: "Post Office, London"
type: "interior"
description: "A typical 1960s London post office - functional, bureaucratic, and utterly mundane. Fluorescent lighting, worn linoleum floors, and a long counter with glass partitions. The epitome of civil service indifference."
mood: "Mundane, bureaucratic, anticlimactic"
visual_notes: "Harsh fluorescent lighting, queue barriers, official notices on walls, worn surfaces that speak to daily routine. The ordinariness should contrast sharply with the historical significance of what's happening."
practical_notes: "Need clear sight lines to the counter and the mail slot/bin where the MBE will be deposited. Sound design important for the anticlimactic 'thunk' of the medal hitting the bottom."
