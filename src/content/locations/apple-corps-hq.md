visual_notes: "Elegant, historic exterior. The interior is a clash of worlds: original Georgian architecture (ornate plasterwork, grand staircases) mixed with late-60s counter-culture (shag carpets, abstract art, beanbags). The boardroom is a nexus of conflict, with a large, imposing table where business arguments happen. The Apple logo is subtly present. The overall feeling is of immense wealth managed with creative disorganization."
practical_notes: "This location must feel like a beautiful prison. It's the physical manifestation of the band's attempt at self-management after Brian Epstein's death. The tension should be palpable beneath the stylish surface. It's where the joy of being in a band dies and the business of being The Beatles takes over."

# Apple Corps HQ (3 Savile Row)

The Beatles' self-created corporate headquarters, intended as a creative haven for artists but which quickly devolved into a stylish but chaotic battleground for the fracturing band.

## Visual Description

From the outside, 3 Savile Row is the picture of London establishment: a pristine, five-story Georgian townhouse. Inside, it's a beautiful mess. The original, elegant architecture is layered with the chaotic psychedelia of the late 60s. Expensive modern furniture sits on plush shag carpets, and avant-garde art hangs next to gold records.

The building's key set is the main boardroom. It features a long, imposing table that has become a site for arguments rather than collaboration. While stylish and expensive, the room feels cold and corporate, a far cry from the warm intimacy of Abbey Road studios. This is where the business of The Beatles happens, and it is killing the band.

## Atmosphere

The mood at Apple is one of a failed utopia. What was meant to be a beacon of creative freedom has become a pressure cooker of financial anxiety, competing egos, and artistic differences. There's a constant low-level hum of tension. Staff walk on eggshells, and the air is thick with unspoken resentments. It is a place that looks creative and vibrant but feels like a corporate mausoleum.

## Symbolic Function

Apple Corps HQ is the physical symbol of the post-Epstein Beatles. It represents their attempt to take control of their own destiny and their ultimate failure to do so without Brian's mediating influence. The building is the stage upon which the final act of their breakup plays out, making it the perfect setting for John's official declaration that the band is over.
