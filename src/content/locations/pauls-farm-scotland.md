# High Park Farm (Paul's Farm, Scotland)

Paul’s counter-image to conspiracy: ordinary domestic life, made cinematic only by how far it is from the machine.

## Visual Description

A hilltop farmhouse and open land under a big, changeable sky. The palette is natural and unsentimental — greens and browns, wind-pressed grass, and the kind of light that never holds still. The landscape should feel like it has room to forgive.

Keep the frame wide and breathable. Paul is small in it, not because he’s diminished, but because he’s finally not being watched.

## Atmosphere

Warmth without glamour. The mood is grounded and physical: laughter, breath in cool air, boots in mud, a child’s weight on a father’s back. This is peace measured in repetition.

## Key Set Dressing / Props

- A simple farmhouse exterior (no signage, no tourist markers)
- Workwear textures: thick jumper, boots, practical layers
- A field path / gate / fence line for movement
- A hint of livestock infrastructure (kept minimal and period-neutral)

## Sound & Rhythm

Wind is constant but not hostile. It’s open-air sound: distant birds, a soft rustle in grass, a laugh carried away. Keep it the opposite of the Falklands wind — not punishment, just weather.

## Cinematic Notes

- Use wide shots and longer takes; let the space do the acting.
- Avoid postcard composition — it should feel lived-in, not advertised.
- The emotional beat is simple: Paul as a father, not a symbol.

## Story Function

This location tells the audience that one of them got out. Not in triumph — in retreat. It’s the quiet rebuke to the idea that the state can meaningfully steer art.
