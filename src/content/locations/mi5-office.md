# MI5 Office

A drab, institutional office space that embodies the soul-crushing nature of mid-level intelligence work. This is where Clive Barrow conducts his "artistic espionage" - typing letters to American newspapers and crafting elaborate surveillance reports that no one will ever read.

## Visual Description

The office is a monument to bureaucratic mediocrity. Harsh fluorescent lighting casts everything in an unflattering pallor. Beige filing cabinets line the walls, stuffed with files that haven't been opened in years. A single window looks out onto a brick wall across a narrow alley.

Clive's desk is cluttered with typewriter ribbons, carbon paper, and stacks of surveillance photographs that are mostly blurry and useless. An overflowing ashtray sits next to a cold cup of tea that's been there since morning.

## Atmosphere

The room feels like a place where dreams come to die. The institutional carpet is worn thin, and there's a persistent smell of stale cigarettes and disappointment. This is the unglamorous reality behind the glamorous world of espionage - endless paperwork, bureaucratic procedures, and the slow erosion of human dignity.

## Symbolic Function

The office represents the gap between Clive's grandiose vision of himself as a master spy and the mundane reality of his position. It's where the absurd meets the banal, where world-changing conspiracies are planned using office supplies and interdepartmental memos.
