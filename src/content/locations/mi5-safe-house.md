type: "interior"
description: "An anonymous, soul-crushing flat in a nondescript Pimlico mansion block. It is a transient, impersonal space used for sensitive briefings that can't happen at headquarters."
mood: "Bleak, clandestine, funereal, claustrophobic"
visual_notes: "Government-issue furniture from the 1950s—a sturdy but ugly table, four uncomfortable chairs. A single, bare lightbulb hangs from the ceiling. The windows are grimy and look out onto a brick air shaft. The air is stale, smelling of old cigarettes, damp, and disinfectant. An overflowing ashtray sits on the table. There are no personal touches; it is a room designed to be forgotten."
practical_notes: "The space must feel cramped and oppressive to heighten the tension of the scene. It's a non-place, a bureaucratic void where immoral decisions are given the sterile language of official directives. The focus should be entirely on the three men trapped in this grim little room."

# MI5 Safe House

A sterile, anonymous flat used for the dirtiest of MI5's business. This is not the bureaucratic world of Thames House; it is a place off the books, where plausible deniability is built into the very walls.

## Visual Description

The safe house is a single room in a forgotten corner of London. The furniture is sparse and brutally functional: a square wooden table, four hard-backed chairs, and nothing else. The wallpaper is a faded, indeterminate beige, stained with decades of nicotine. A single, bare lightbulb hangs from a frayed cord, casting a harsh, unflattering light that creates deep shadows on the faces of its occupants. The only window is sealed shut and looks out onto a brick wall, offering no escape.

## Atmosphere

The room feels like a moral vacuum. It's a place stripped of all humanity, designed for the sole purpose of communicating unpleasant orders. The air is heavy and still, and every sound—a chair scraping, a cough, the scratch of a pen—is amplified by the oppressive silence. It is a place where men are told to do monstrous things in the most mundane way imaginable.

## Symbolic Function

The safe house represents the dark, hidden underbelly of the state. If the MI5 office is the absurd, public face of bureaucratic folly, the safe house is its chilling, efficient heart. It is the point where the cynical games and theatrical plots of the establishment cross over into real, life-or-death consequences. It is the room where Nigel Finch's conscience is officially cornered and where Clive Barrow's artistic delusions are finally given a deadly canvas.
