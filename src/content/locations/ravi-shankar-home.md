# Ravi Shankar's Home (Bombay)

A space that teaches by removing distraction.

## Visual Description

A simple, elegant room where fame has not been allowed to leave fingerprints.

The space should feel deliberate:

- Rugs, low seating, and open floor.
- Sunlight filtered through slatted blinds.
- Sparse furnishings chosen for function and calm.
- A sitar treated like an instrument, not a trophy.

Nothing here tries to impress Western eyes. That refusal is part of the power.

## Atmosphere

The quiet is earned. Incense and warm light create a sense of ritual without theatre.

This is “Beatles world” warmth, but disciplined—the opposite of London’s cluttered creativity. It’s not chaotic; it’s focused.

## Character Use

- **Ravi Shankar** uses the space as a teaching environment: authority expressed through patience and precision.
- **George Harrison** arrives with Western urgency and leaves (slowly) with something calmer. His boots by the door are a small, important detail: he is learning how to enter correctly.

From the outside (MI5/Committee), this room becomes a screen for paranoia—“foreign influence” projected onto stillness.

## Symbolic Function

This location is a rebuke to the royal/MI5 world. It demonstrates a different kind of power:

- not inherited
- not bureaucratic
- not enforced

It’s discipline as a path rather than a command.

## Key Set Dressing / Props

- A small incense source (subtle, not exoticized)
- Practice materials (notations, strings, tuning tools)
- A clear space on the floor that signals “this is where you sit”
