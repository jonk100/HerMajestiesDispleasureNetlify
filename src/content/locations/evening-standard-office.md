# London Evening Standard Office

The newsroom of one of London's most influential newspapers, where the cultural conversations of the 1960s are both reflected and shaped. This is where journalists like Maureen Cleave work to understand and explain the rapidly changing world around them.

## Visual Description

A classic 1960s newsroom - open-plan with rows of wooden desks, each equipped with a typewriter and overflowing ashtrays. The constant clacking of keys creates a rhythmic backdrop to shouted conversations between reporters and editors. Stacks of newspapers, both their own and competitors', cover every available surface.

Large windows look out onto Fleet Street, the traditional heart of British journalism. The walls are covered with front pages from major stories, press photos, and assignment boards covered in scribbled notes.

## Symbolic Elements

Represents the power of the press to shape public opinion and cultural understanding. The newsroom embodies the intersection of information, interpretation, and influence that will prove crucial to the Beatles' story.

## Key Set Dressing / Props

- Typewriters mid-sentence, paper half-fed and curling
- Wire photo baskets and contact sheets pinned to boards
- Telephones that never stop ringing
- Ashtrays and cigarette burns on desks (lived-in, not romantic)
- Press passes, assignment sheets, and an editor’s red pencil

## Sound & Rhythm

The soundtrack is mechanical and human at the same time: clacking keys, ringing phones, shouted copy edits, a kettle boiling somewhere off-frame. Dialogue should compete with the room, forcing characters to lean in, interrupt, and fight for space.

## Cinematic Notes

- Keep the camera moving like a deadline: drifting, searching, never fully settled.
- Use long lenses down desk rows to create compression—everyone on top of each other.
- Let the newsroom feel smart and slightly brutal; curiosity with teeth.

## Story Function

This location is where narrative becomes “official.” It’s the machine that turns messy reality into public myth. The newsroom doesn’t need to be villainous; its danger is structural: it must simplify, it must publish, it must move on.
