# Buckingham Palace - Investiture Room

The formal ceremonial room where MBE investitures take place. This is where the collision between rock and roll irreverence and royal tradition begins.

## Historical Context

The actual MBE ceremony for The Beatles took place on October 26, 1965, in this very room. The contrast between the band's youth and casual attitude against the centuries-old formal protocol creates the perfect setting for Prince Philip's initial outrage.

## Key Visual Elements

- Ornate throne area where The Queen conducts the ceremony
- Side viewing area where Prince Philip observes
- Formal processional path for recipients
- Traditional royal regalia and ceremonial elements

## Atmosphere

The room should feel like a living diorama of continuity: hushed voices, measured footsteps, and an airless sense that history is watching. Even when nothing is happening, the space insists on ritual.

## Blocking & Power Geography

Hierarchy is built into the architecture. The Queen is elevated and still; everyone else moves along prescribed lines. The Beatles should look like they're in the wrong genre of film—too alive, too loose, too modern—without turning them into caricature.

## Key Set Dressing / Props

- Portraits of monarchs arranged like a panel of silent judges
- Heavy drapery and formal seating that suggests a courtroom more than a celebration
- Medals and regalia presented as objects of meaning and control
- A few precise markers of protocol: where to stand, where to bow, where to exit

## Sound & Rhythm

Prioritize the sounds of ceremony over dialogue: shoes on polished floor, the small metallic clink of a medal, a breath held too long. When a Beatle speaks, it should feel like breaking a rule.

## Thematic Function

This is the film's “inciting room”: a stage where the Crown performs inevitability and the Beatles inadvertently perform entropy. The setting embodies institutional patience—its power is not rage, but endurance. That makes Philip's later obsession feel both petty and terrifying.
