# Clive Barrow's Flat

A private chamber of grand plans made from small materials.

## Visual Description

A narrow bedsit whose dimensions are slightly humiliating: the bed is always in frame with the desk, and the desk is always in frame with the sink. The wallpaper is tired, the corners slightly damp, the light perpetually wrong.

Clive has tried to turn this into a command center through sheer willpower and stationery.

The desk is the altar:

- A typewriter that clacks like a weapon.
- Carbon paper and half-failed drafts.
- Neat little stacks of envelopes sorted by size.
- A cheap rubber stamp kit and a tin of ink that never quite closes.
- A battered atlas opened to the American South.

There is always one absurd touch of pretension:

- A beret hung on a peg like a uniform.
- A few “art books” with pristine spines, pages barely touched.
- A notebook filled with jargon that reads like poetry to him and nonsense to everyone else.

## Atmosphere

The room should feel constantly mid-scheme. The electric heater clicks on and off like a metronome for obsession. Outside noise comes through the walls—someone else’s life—while Clive works as if history depends on postage.

This is the comic heart of the premise’s bureaucracy theme: the world’s most overconfident “mastermind” surrounded by cheap tea, paper cuts, and a faint smell of wet wool.

## Character Use

- **Clive Barrow** treats the flat like a theatre. It’s where he rehearses his own importance, drafts “voices,” and reframes every failure as an “unintentional success matrix.”
- **Nigel Finch** (if he ever enters) would be visibly pained by the clutter and the improvised “systems.” Nigel’s competence and Clive’s mania read instantly in the production design.

## Symbolic Function

Clive’s flat is the physical manifestation of the story’s central satire:

- A petty grudge translated into a “campaign.”
- Grand institutional power executed through office supplies.
- The state’s machinery revealed to be, at times, one man with a typewriter and a delusion.

It is also the birthplace of the “manufactured choir” idea—respectable outrage produced like a script.

## Key Set Dressing / Props

- Stamps from multiple countries (his “tools for international manipulation”)
- A folder labeled with a single ominous word (e.g. “FEEDBACK”)
- Clippings about Lennon and religion, folded until soft at the creases
- A map with pins and circles that imply strategy, even when it’s just geography
