# John's Weybridge Home

John Lennon's suburban mansion represents the contradiction of Beatles success - material wealth that cannot satisfy spiritual hunger. By 1966, this house has become both sanctuary and prison for John's restless mind.

## Visual Description

A Tudor-style mansion in the affluent Surrey suburb of Weybridge. Large windows let in natural light, but the house feels somehow sterile despite its luxury. Expensive furniture that looks barely used, as if John is uncomfortable with his own success.

The most striking feature is the books - everywhere. Philosophy, religion, Eastern mysticism, poetry. They're stacked on tables, scattered across chairs, left open on windowsills. The house looks like a library exploded in a showroom.

## Symbolic Elements

The contrast between material success and spiritual emptiness. The books represent John's hunger for meaning beyond fame and fortune. The isolation of suburbia mirrors John's growing detachment from conventional life.
