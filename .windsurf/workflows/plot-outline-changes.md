description: Update the referenced file based on changes to the story outline and premise
---

I've made recent changes to the plot that require significant changes to many other files in the repo, so please:

1. Analyze the following files:
- /home/jk/CreativeWriting/HerMajestiesDispleasure/context/01-Premise.md
- /home/jk/CreativeWriting/HerMajestiesDispleasure/context/05-Outline.md
2. Determine whether the referenced file(s) from the prompt need to be updated to fit with the new premise and outline.
3. Make the changes to the file and suggest related files that might be affected for next analysis
