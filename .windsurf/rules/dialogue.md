# Rules for writing dialogue in the screenplay

Before writing any dialogue, always consider:

- The [premise](/home/jk/CreativeWriting/HerMajestiesDispleasure/context/01-Premise.md) of the screenplay
- The [relationships](/home/jk/CreativeWriting/HerMajestiesDispleasure/context/03-CharacterMap.json) of the characters speaking
- Each character's full context, profile, and arc, which can be found in the [characters collection](/home/jk/CreativeWriting/HerMajestiesDispleasure/src/content/characters)
- Related research within the entry for each character in the characters collections, especially any related research involving quotes. Related research is linked within the "## Related Research" section of the character entry, and is located in the [research collection](/home/jk/CreativeWriting/HerMajestiesDispleasure/src/content/research)
