t-FADE IN:
s-INT. BUCKINGHAM PALACE – PRIVATE SITTING ROOM – EVENING
a-A quiet, orderly room. No clutter. No softness. Everything is placed, not lived in.
a-PRINCE PHILIP (46) stands by a sideboard, pouring himself a drink with naval precision.
a-On a small wireless radio across the room, a BBC announcer fades out.
a-MUSIC fades in.
a-It’s The Beatles. Mid-period. Harmonies layered, slightly strange. Not aggressive. Not polite either.
a-Philip freezes. He listens.
a-Not with curiosity — with assessment.
a-He crosses the room and turns the volume up a fraction. The music fills the space, clashing with the room’s perfect order.
a-A lyric drifts by. Oblique. Abstract. Earnest in a way Philip finds immediately suspect.
a-Philip frowns.
c-PRINCE PHILIP
d-What is this supposed to be?
a-He listens longer. A chord change surprises him. He doesn’t like that it does.
a-The song builds — voices overlapping, refusing to resolve cleanly.
a-Philip exhales sharply through his nose.
c-PRINCE PHILIP
d-It’s just… noise.
a-He reaches out and snaps the radio off mid-phrase.
a-Sudden silence. Restored order.
a-Philip stands there for a beat, drink untouched.
a-He looks at the radio as if it has failed a basic test.
c-PRINCE PHILIP
d-No discipline.
a-He straightens his cuff, already done.
a-The verdict has been delivered. Case closed.

s-INT. MI5 Q-BRANCH - DAY (EARLY 1966)
a-A cavernous, chilly storeroom in the bowels of Whitehall. Fluorescent lights hum over rows of grey metal shelving, meticulously labeled but covered in a fine layer of dust. The air smells of ozone and old Bakelite. This is where spy technology comes to die.
a-PERCY DALTON (57), a wiry man in a brown cardigan and thick glasses, stands behind a long counter, polishing a hefty piece of Cold War-era equipment with a soft cloth. He is the obsessive gatekeeper of this forgotten kingdom.
a-NIGEL FINCH (49) and CLIVE BARROW (42) approach the counter. Nigel carries a clipboard with a requisition form. Clive practically vibrates with excitement.
c-CLIVE
d-Morning, Percy! We require some kit for a... delicate undertaking. Audio surveillance. I was thinking something discreet. A miniature sonic amplifier, perhaps? Something state-of-the-art.
a-Percy stops polishing. He looks slowly up from the device, over the top of his glasses. The look is one of profound, ancient weariness.
c-PERCY
p-(clipped, irritated)
d-Form 12-C. In triplicate.
a-Nigel slides a perfectly completed form across the counter. Percy picks it up, inspects it with suspicion, then grunts.
c-PERCY (CONT'D)
d-"Miniature."
p-(he scoffs)
d-This isn't a bloody Bond film, Barrow. This is His Majesty's government. We have standards. And budgets.
a-He turns and disappears into the aisles. After a moment of rummaging, he returns, placing a heavy, metal box on the counter with a loud THUD. It looks like a car battery with a large cone attached to it.
c-PERCY (CONT'D)
d-Item 47-B. Parabolic Listening Device. German. 1953. Very reliable.
c-CLIVE
p-(deflated)
d-Right. And... how does one conceal that? In a bread van?
c-PERCY
p-(ignoring him)
d-Battery life is approximately ninety minutes, provided you don't use it in the damp. The last agent who used this in the damp, a chap in Budapest, caused a short. Do you know what a replacement valve costs for a '53 Telefunken?
a-Nigel sighs, a sound of pure existential despair.
c-NIGEL
d-Go on then, Percy.
c-PERCY
d-Fourteen pounds and sixpence! A month's wages for some people. And he didn't return it in the original packaging. Had to fill out a Form 21-A for non-compliance. Truly dreadful business.
a-Percy hands Clive a tangle of wires and a pair of enormous headphones.
c-PERCY (CONT'D)
d-Now, you lose a single one of these transmitter screws, and that comes out of your travel stipend. I'm not joking. I'll be checking the manifest upon return.
c-CLIVE
p-(desperately)
d-We're conducting a psychological ricochet operation against a major cultural target! We can't do it with a museum piece!
c-PERCY
d-You can do it with what you're given, Barrow. Just like everyone else. Sign here. And here. Initial there.
a-He pushes the clipboard toward Clive. Nigel is already walking away, having accepted their fate.
c-NIGEL
p-(over his shoulder)
d-Don't forget the original packaging, Clive.
a-Percy watches them go, then returns to polishing his device, the guardian of mediocrity, utterly content in his perfectly ordered, perfectly useless world.

t-FADE IN:
s-INT. EMI STUDIOS, STUDIO TWO - NIGHT (APRIL 1966)
a-The legendary studio has been transformed into a mad scientist's laboratory. The air is thick with cigarette smoke and the smell of hot vacuum tubes.
a-JOHN LENNON (25), eyes wide with manic energy, is directing chaos. He stands over a dozen tape recorders, each playing a short, strange loop of sound— a distorted laugh, a seagull's cry, a sitar phrase played backwards.
c-JOHN
p-(to a young studio engineer)
d-Right, on my signal, you push that fader up. Paul, you ready on the wine glass?
a-PAUL MCCARTNEY (23), ever the professional, holds a pencil poised over a half-full glass of red wine, ready to create a specific ringing tone. He nods, a focused smile on his face.
a-GEORGE HARRISON (23) sits cross-legged on a rug, his sitar across his lap, quietly observing the controlled chaos with the look of a man who finally feels at home.
a-RINGO STARR (25) sits behind his drum kit, a bemused but supportive grin on his face. He taps out a steady, hypnotic beat. Another night at the office.
c-PAUL
p-(laughing with scepticism)
d-Sounds like a thousand seagulls being tortured.
c-JOHN
p-(gleefully)
d-Exactly! It's the sound of the void, Macca! The sound of what happens after you die! Or before you're born. Haven't decided yet.
a-The control room door opens and BRIAN EPSTEIN (31) enters. He's impeccably dressed in a dark suit, a stark contrast to the band's casual attire. He looks like a visiting headmaster stepping into the art room during a finger-painting session.
a-He stands for a moment, watching the scene. He's here to discuss the upcoming American tour, but the words die on his lips.
c-BRIAN
p-(to the engineer, quietly)
d-What are they... doing?
c-ENGINEER
p-(without looking up)
d-Making the tape loops for "Tomorrow Never Knows," Mr. Epstein. John wants it to sound like the Dalai Lama singing from a mountaintop.
a-Brian nods, though he clearly doesn't understand. He sees Paul, George, and Ringo all holding pencils, ready to manipulate the tape machines. They are a single unit, a four-headed creative organism operating on a level he can't access.
c-JOHN
d-Okay... NOW!
a-On his cue, everyone pushes faders and starts their machines. A cacophony of sound erupts—alien, terrifying, and exhilarating.
a-Through the chaos, Ringo's drumming remains the solid, unwavering heartbeat. Paul, despite his teasing, is completely committed, his brow furrowed in concentration. George closes his eyes, meditating on the sound.
a-Brian watches them, a complicated expression on his face. It's pride, mixed with a profound sense of obsolescence. He came here to talk about logistics, contracts, television appearances—the world outside this room. But he can see with painful clarity that their world is now inside this room.
a-He turns to leave, unnoticed by the band.
c-PAUL
p-(shouting over the noise)
d-Try the seagull one again! Slow it down a bit!
a-John gives him a thumbs-up, his face ecstatic.
a-Brian pauses at the door, looks back one last time. They don't need him for this. For the first time, he understands that his job is no longer to build their career, but merely to manage the fallout from their genius.
a-He quietly closes the door, leaving them to their creation. The camera stays inside the studio, moving between the four of them, a tight, focused unit, inventing a new language together, completely oblivious to the world outside—and to the man who brought them there, now walking away down a long, empty corridor.

s-INT.PAUL MCCARTNEY’S HOUSE (CAVENDISH AVENUE) – DAY
a-The music room. Tasteful. Ordered. A deliberate contrast to John’s chaotic library.
a-PAUL sits on a sofa, strumming an acoustic guitar.
a-He plays a beautiful melodic fragment of “Here, There and Everywhere.” Soft. Sweet. Effortless.
a-NIGEL FINCH is bent over an upright piano.
a-He wears blue coveralls embroidered: “B&H PIANO SERVICES.”
a-He strikes a key.
a-PING.

a-Paul brightens despite himself.
c-PAUL
d-You think? Bit soft, maybe?
c-NIGEL
d-Nah. That’s what people want, isn’t it? A nice tune. Something you can whistle to while the kettle boils.
a-Nigel deliberately hits a discordant note.
a-PING.
c-NIGEL
d-Not like that other racket.
a-Paul pauses.
c-PAUL
d-What other racket?
c-NIGEL
d-Oh, you know. The radio. Some of the new stuff coming out. My daughter played me that last record… what was it? The one with the sitar?
c-PAUL
d-“Norwegian Wood.”
c-NIGEL
d-That’s the badger. Gave me a headache, tell you the truth. No offense, sir. Just… a bloke gets home from work, he doesn’t want to be educated, does he? He wants to be cheered up.
a-Paul absorbs this. His smile fades.
a-This is his deepest fear, unspoken until now.
c-PAUL
d-John—my mate—he thinks we need to challenge people. Shake them up a bit.
a-Nigel shakes his head sadly, like a mechanic diagnosing a terminal fault.
c-NIGEL

d-Stick to the love songs, Mr. McCartney. That’s what keeps the lights on.
a-Nigel exits.
a-Paul remains seated in the sudden silence.
a-He looks down at his guitar.
a-He plays a single chord.
a-It sounds lonely.
a-He picks up a pen and scribbles aggressively on a lyric sheet, crossing out a stranger, more abstract line.
a-He writes instead:
a-“I need my love to be here.”

s-EXT. LONDON STREET – DAY (EARLY 1966)
a-A perfectly ordinary London street. Buses hiss. Shoppers drift past. Nothing of consequence is happening.
a-At a small wrought-iron café table sit NIGEL FINCH and CLIVE BARROW, dressed in painfully unremarkable civilian clothes. Tea cups steam gently between them.
a-On the table: a folded newspaper, a sugar bowl, and a battered leather briefcase.
a-Nigel stirs his tea with quiet precision.
a-Clive is vibrating.
c-CLIVE
d-All right. This is it. This is where it becomes theatre.
a-Nigel does not look up.
c-NIGEL
d-We are drinking tea.
c-CLIVE
d-Exactly. Performance art. The mundane as camouflage.
a-Nigel sighs.
c-NIGEL
d-Please don’t say “performance art” in public.
a-Clive opens the briefcase just enough to peer inside. A tangled mess of wires, valves, and dials.
c-CLIVE
d-I’ve recalibrated the receiver. Narrowed the frequency band. Reduced interference.
c-NIGEL
d-From what?
c-CLIVE
d-Reality.
a-Nigel checks his watch.
a-Across the street: a terraced house. Curtains drawn. No movement.
c-NIGEL
d-We are listening for…?
c-CLIVE
p-(conspiratorial)
d-Influence. Intent. The psychic residue of celebrity.
a-Nigel closes his eyes briefly.
c-NIGEL
d-We are listening for sound, Clive.
c-CLIVE
d-Yes, but sound adjacent.
a-Clive removes a device from the briefcase. It is far too large to be discreet.
a-He places it on the café table. It does not belong there.
a-A WAITRESS pauses mid-step, staring.
c-WAITRESS
d-…is that a radio?
c-CLIVE
d-Experimental.
a-Nigel instinctively reaches for identification, then stops himself.
c-NIGEL
d-It’s German.
a-The waitress walks away, unsettled.
a-Clive fits oversized headphones over his ears.
c-CLIVE
p-(reverent)
d-I’m in.
a-Nigel leans closer despite himself.
c-NIGEL
d-And?
a-Static crackles. A distant, unintelligible voice flickers.
c-CLIVE
d-Wait… there. Did you hear that?
c-NIGEL
d-Hear what?
c-CLIVE
d-Intent.
a-Nigel listens. Nothing.
c-NIGEL
d-I heard a kettle.
c-CLIVE
d-Yes. Domestic ritual. The unseen architecture of influence.
a-Nigel rubs his temples.
c-NIGEL
d-We’re meant to observe. Not commune.
a-Clive leans toward the device.
c-CLIVE
d-We’re listening.
a-A sudden LOUD POP from the headphones.
a-Clive yelps, tearing them off.
c-CLIVE
d-That was something.
c-NIGEL
d-That was a bus.
a-Silence.
a-A dog barks nearby.
a-The device hums, then dies.
c-CLIVE
d-Battery’s gone.
a-Nigel closes the briefcase.
c-NIGEL
d-We’ve gathered sufficient intelligence.
c-CLIVE
d-Already?
c-NIGEL
d-Yes. Nothing happened. No one spoke. The nation remains intact.
a-Nigel scans the room unassumingly. Clive considers this, shaking his head.
c-CLIVE
d-That’s not what concerns me.
c-NIGEL
d-Oh?
c-CLIVE
d-There was no center. No voice. No instruction. Just… diffusion.
c-NIGEL
d-That’s always been the case with popular culture.
c-CLIVE
d-No. Popular culture amplifies authority. This dissolves it.
a-Nigel considers this, genuinely.
c-NIGEL
d-They don’t issue commands.
c-CLIVE
d-Exactly. They don’t replace authority — they make it irrelevant.
a-Nigel stirs his tea again. Slower now.
c-NIGEL
d-I’d argue the opposite. They become it. Accidentally.
c-CLIVE
p-(skeptical)
d-You don't think they know what they’re doing?
c-NIGEL
d-I think it doesn’t matter whether they do.
a-The street continues. A bus hisses. A spoon clinks somewhere.
c-CLIVE
p-(confused)
d-So what sort of threat is that?
a-Nigel stands, pushing the briefcase toward Clive. He places understandingly exact change on the table.
c-NIGEL
d-The sort you don’t arrest. 
a-He starts to walk away, but stops and turns to Clive.
c-NIGEL
d-Let’s never do this again.
a-He walks away. The café remains unchanged. 
a-Clive opens the device, connects the headphones, twiddles with a few buttons. No luck. He puts it away and stares through the window, a look of determination on his face.
a-The house across the street remains silent.

s-INT. SOHO BOOKSHOP - DAY (EARLY 1966)
a-A cramped, atmospheric independent bookshop. Floor-to-ceiling shelves packed with esoteric texts create narrow, maze-like aisles. A small corner is dedicated to imported vinyl LPs. The air is thick with the scent of old paper and sandalwood incense.
a-NIGEL FINCH (49) stands behind the counter, transformed. Gone is the weary bureaucrat. He wears a comfortable cardigan, half-moon reading glasses, and has cultivated a slightly bohemian air. He is the picture of a man who has found peace among books.
a-The shop bell CHIMES softly. GEORGE HARRISON (23) enters. He’s fresh from the success of Rubber Soul, but a searching uncertainty hangs about him. He used the sitar on "Norwegian Wood," but knows he only scratched the surface. It was a texture, not an art form.
a-George wanders toward the Eastern Philosophy section, his fingers trailing along book spines. He pauses on Practical Lessons in Yoga by Swami Sivananda, reads the back cover, then gently returns it to the shelf. Next to it, The Science of Pranayama — he flips it open, stares at a diagram of alternate nostril breathing, and shakes his head. He picks up The Book of Tea by Okakura Kakuzō, runs a thumb across its worn edge, then places it back like a fragile artifact. A stray, dog-eared copy of Howl by Allen Ginsberg is shoved between the titles — George smirks faintly, sets it aside.
a-Finally, he pulls out a volume by Alan Watts — The Way of Zen. He flips through it, slows on a paragraph about silence and direct experience, then replaces it with a small sigh.
a-Nigel observes from behind his glasses, timing his approach. He walks to a small record player behind the counter and gently drops the needle on a spinning LP. A complex, mesmerizing SITAR melody fills the quiet shop. The sound is impossibly rich and fluid.
a-George looks up, captivated. He approaches the counter.
c-GEORGE
d-What is that?
c-NIGEL
p-(without looking up, as if stating a fact of nature)
d-That is Ravi Shankar. The source.
a-George listens, rapt. The gulf between this and his own playing feels immense.
c-GEORGE
d-It’s… a whole other world. I’ve been… dabbling with one. A sitar. But it doesn't sound like that.
a-Nigel looks up, his expression one of gentle, academic interest.
c-NIGEL
p-(a flicker of a knowing smile)
d-Ah. Yes. A common observation. One can acquire the instrument, but the philosophy... that must be sought.
a-The word "philosophy" lands perfectly. It’s exactly what George feels is missing.
c-GEORGE
d-Exactly. It feels like there's something more. Beyond just the notes.
c-NIGEL
p-(nodding sagely)
d-Because there is. The sitar is not merely a collection of strings and wood. It’s a discipline. A path. To play it correctly, one must understand the silence between the notes. The unstruck sound.
a-This resonates deeply. It’s the language he's been trying to find.
c-GEORGE
d-But how do you even begin to learn that? It seems… impossibly complex.
a-Nigel feigns a thoughtful pause, as if accessing a piece of cultural trivia.
c-NIGEL
d-It’s interesting you should ask. There's another young man, a customer. From that group, The Rolling Stones. The blond one.
p-(a dismissive wave)
d-A bit more... frantic, their music. But he is a very serious student.
a-This piques George's interest intensely. A peer. A rival, even.
c-GEORGE
d-Brian Jones?
c-NIGEL
p-(snapping his fingers softly)
d-That's the one. He tells me the only way to truly understand the music is to go to the master himself. He’s been taking lessons. From Mr. Shankar.
a-The pieces click into place for George. It’s not just about practice; it's about apprenticeship. A lineage.
c-NIGEL (CONT'D)
d-He says Shankar is... particular. He doesn't suffer fools or dilettantes. One must demonstrate a genuine spiritual commitment.
a-Nigel is now performing the most sophisticated kind of manipulation: using the truth. He's not inventing a path; he's merely illuminating it, framing it as a challenge worthy of George's deep spirit, while subtly positioning the more "frantic" Brian Jones as someone who has already started the journey.
a-George looks determined. This isn't just about music anymore. It's about creative and spiritual respect.
c-GEORGE
d-Ravi Shankar. He lives here? In London?
a-Nigel takes a small slip of paper from a notepad. He writes the name on it with a fountain pen, his handwriting neat and precise.
c-NIGEL
d-He visits. One has to be… attentive. But I believe a man like Brian Jones would know how to make an introduction, if one were to ask. One seeker to another.
a-He slides the paper across the counter. It contains only two words: "Ravi Shankar."
c-GEORGE
p-(taking the paper)
d-Thank you.
c-NIGEL
p-(with a slight, formal bow)
d-The path appears when the student is ready.
a-George tucks the paper carefully into his jacket pocket. It feels like a key. He gives Nigel a grateful nod and exits.
a-Nigel watches him go. He calmly turns back to his leather-bound journal—his operational log, disguised as a shop ledger. He finds the page headed "OPERATION MINUET - SUBJECT: HARRISON, G." and makes a new entry in his precise, bureaucratic script.
c-NIGEL (V.O.)
p-(reading his own writing)
d-Vector Identified: B. Jones (Rolling Stones). Target primed with information regarding subject's tutelage under R. Shankar. Path to spiritual and artistic divergence successfully illuminated. Subject believes discovery to be his own.
a-He closes the book. The music of Ravi Shankar plays on, now sounding less like a beautiful melody and more like the soundtrack to a perfectly executed act of bureaucratic sabotage.

s-INT. BUCKINGHAM PALACE – BREAKFAST ROOM – MORNING
a-A long table laid with silver and porcelain. Everything gleams. Everything is correct.
a-THE QUEEN and PRINCE PHILIP sit opposite one another in perfect silence.
a-Philip reads a newspaper. The headline screams: “BEATLEMANIA HITS JAPAN.”
a-He is seething.
a-The Queen is absorbed in a crossword puzzle.
c-PRINCE PHILIP
d-They’re treated like heads of state. It’s embarrassing.
c-THE QUEEN
p-(without looking up)
d-Four down. “A chaotic disturbance.” Six letters.
c-PRINCE PHILIP
d-Did you hear the tape I played you? The “Tomorrow Never Knows” ghastliness? It sounds like a submarine in distress.
c-THE QUEEN
d-Tumult.
a-She writes it into the crossword.
c-THE QUEEN
d-Philip, you must stop listening to them if it upsets you so.
c-PRINCE PHILIP
d-I am not upset. I am vigilant. Mountbatten agrees. It is a subversion of British values. We have agents in the field, Lilibet. We are taking steps.
a-The Queen finally looks up. She peers over her spectacles.
c-THE QUEEN
d-Agents?
c-PRINCE PHILIP
d-Operational assets. To… guide them. Gently.
c-THE QUEEN
d-Just ensure these “assets” don’t make a mess on the carpet. I have a reception for the Ambassador of Chad at noon.
a-She returns to her crossword.
c-THE QUEEN
d-And Philip?
c-PRINCE PHILIP
d-Yes?
c-THE QUEEN
d-I rather liked “Yesterday.”
a-Philip stares at her, betrayed.
a-He snaps the newspaper back up, hiding his face.
c-PRINCE PHILIP
p-(from behind the paper)
d-No discipline.

s-INT. MI5 OFFICE - DAY (MARCH 1966)
a-A cramped, soul-crushing office space. Harsh fluorescent lighting casts everything in an unflattering pallor. Beige filing cabinets line the walls. A single window looks out onto a brick wall.
a-CLIVE BARROW (42) sits at a cluttered desk, pecking away at an ancient typewriter with the intensity of a concert pianist. His desk is a monument to bureaucratic chaos - surveillance photos (mostly blurry), carbon paper, and an overflowing ashtray next to a cold cup of tea.
a-He pauses, studies his work with the satisfaction of a master craftsman, then continues typing. The CLACKING of keys echoes in the sterile room.
a-CLOSE-UP on the typewriter. We see fragments of text being typed: "...as a concerned Christian and longtime reader of your publication, I was deeply troubled by recent comments made by John Lennon of The Beatles regarding our Lord and Savior..."
a-Clive stops typing. He leans back in his chair, which squeaks ominously, and reads his work with the reverence of a poet reviewing his masterpiece.
c-CLIVE
p-(to himself, theatrical whisper)
d-Psychological ricochet... in motion.
a-He rolls the paper out of the typewriter with a flourish. The letterhead reads "Mrs. Gladys Pemberton, Birmingham, Alabama."
a-On his desk lies a massive stack of envelopes, already sealed. We see the top one - addressed in neat block letters to "DATEBOOK Magazine, New York, NY". Clive folds his newly typed "Gladys Pemberton" letter, slides it into an envelope addressed to "The Alabama Baptist Herald, Attn: Letters to the Editor."
a-He seals it and opens his desk drawer, revealing a collection of stamps from various countries - his tools for international manipulation. He selects an American stamp with the care of a surgeon choosing an instrument.
a-EXTREME CLOSE-UP: Clive's tongue as he licks the stamp. The camera pulls back slowly and we see his eyes closed in what can only be described as sensual satisfaction.
a-He attaches the stamp to the letter, places it on top of the Datebook letter and takes a deep breath - examining the pile of letters and envelopes like a general reviewing his troops before battle.
c-CLIVE
d-And... scene.
a-He places the pile of letters in a wire basket labeled "OUTGOING POST" with the reverence of placing a wreath on a war memorial.
