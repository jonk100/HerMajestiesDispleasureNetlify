## EPISODE 1: "The Investiture"
**Timeframe:** October 1965 – March 1966
**Episode Summary:** The series begins with The Beatles receiving their MBEs at Buckingham Palace, where John Lennon's offhand remark about the medals being given to those who "drive tanks and win wars" ignites Prince Philip's fury. While the band celebrates at Brian Epstein's house, oblivious to the coming storm, Philip convenes a secret royal committee that authorizes "Operation Minuet" - a covert MI5 mission to neutralize the band as a cultural threat. We meet the bumbling intelligence agents Nigel and Clive, who are tasked with this absurd mission, and watch as they begin their surveillance of the band during the Rubber Soul sessions. The episode culminates in John's infamous "more popular than Jesus" interview with Maureen Cleave, setting the stage for the cultural firestorm to come.

## EPISODE 6: "The Crown Endures"
**Timeframe:** January 1970 – December 1980
**Episode Summary:** The final episode follows the bungled assassination attempt during John's 1970 concert, where a perfect storm of incompetence, conscience, and authentic art defeats the meticulously planned conspiracy.

In the aftermath, the establishment efficiently erases its failures, with Clive and Nigel reassigned to the Falklands desk. The series ends with the thematic resolution: while both the chaotic artist (John) and the obsessed royal (Philip) are exhausted by their conflict, the soulless, patient machinery of the state grinds on, unchanged. The final montage shows the separate peaces found by the artists versus the unending purgatory of the bureaucrats, ending with the tragic irony of John's 1980 assassination - not by conspiracy, but by a lone gunman.
