s-INT. MI5 SAFE HOUSE - DAY (JANUARY 1970)

a-A room of profound, bureaucratic misery. The color palette is a symphony of desaturated institutional beige and melancholic grey. Fluorescent lights hum with oppressive indifference.

a-The room is framed in a deadpan, symmetrical wide shot.

a-SIR DEREK FINCHLEY (59) sits perfectly poised at the head of a cheap wooden table. He is the picture of calm, corporate authority. His slim leather portfolio sits closed before him.

a-NIGEL FINCH (53) sits to his left, a statue of weary resignation. His teacup and saucer are aligned perfectly with the edge of the table.

a-CLIVE BARROW (46) sits opposite, vibrating with a nervous energy the room cannot contain.

a-The air is thick with the unspoken gravity of their last meeting. Finchley clears his throat, a soft, polite sound that cuts through the silence.

c-SIR DEREK FINCHLEY
d-Gentlemen. I have just come from a meeting at the highest level. A strategic reassessment has been made regarding the subject. Operation Minuet has been... concluded.

a-Clive looks momentarily confused, a schoolboy whose favorite game has been cancelled. Nigel doesn't move. He expected this.

c-SIR DEREK FINCHLEY (CONT'D)
d-While the operation's primary objective—the fracturing of the group—has been achieved, recent actions by the primary subject have created an unforeseen complication. It is now the view that the subject no longer represents a cultural nuisance, but a political one.

a-He slides a single, unsigned sheet of paper from his portfolio and places it in the center of the table.

c-SIR DEREK FINCHLEY (CONT'D)
d-As such, a new directive has been issued. The subject's file is to be closed. His activities are to be brought to a... final conclusion. The matter is to be permanently retired.

a-He delivers the lines in a flat, pleasant monotone, as if reading a quarterly budget report.

a-Nigel's hand trembles slightly. His teacup rattles against the saucer with a sharp, ceramic CLICK.

a-Clive leans forward, his eyes scanning the memo's euphemisms. His face, which had been confused, slowly transforms. A manic, creative glee dawns in his eyes. He looks up, breathless.

c-CLIVE
p-(A hushed, reverent whisper)
d-My God. It's the third act.

a-He leaps from his chair and rushes to a dusty chalkboard on the wall, grabbing a piece of chalk.

c-CLIVE (CONT'D)
p-(Muttering to himself)
d-A permanent resolution... It requires artistry. A performance piece...

a-Nigel stares at Finchley, his face draining of color.

c-NIGEL
d-Sir... I'm not sure I understand the operational parameters.

c-SIR DEREK FINCHLEY
p-(Looking him dead in the eye)
d-I think you do, Nigel.

a-The word hangs in the air. The ugly, unspoken truth. Nigel swallows hard.

c-NIGEL
p-(A whisper)
d-This is assassination.

a-The word sounds vulgar and clumsy in the sterile room.

a-Clive, at the chalkboard, stops sketching. He turns, a wild look in his eye, a piece of chalk held like a conductor's baton.

c-CLIVE
d-Don't be so pedestrian, Nigel! It's not an assassination, it's a... a composition! A public performance that concludes with a private solution! I call it... The Pigeon Gambit!

a-He gestures grandly to the chalkboard, which is now covered in a frantic scrawl of arrows and stick figures.

c-CLIVE (CONT'D)
d-The target, Lennon, is scheduled to perform at a UNICEF charity concert. The irony is sublime! He delivers himself to us. Phase One: our asset in the lighting crew creates an 'Ono Obfuscation'—a single, isolating spotlight on the wife. The crowd is distracted. Phase Two...

a-Nigel stares at him, horrified. He turns back to Finchley, pleading.

c-NIGEL
d-Sir Derek. This is... madness. It's not what we do. We are an intelligence service, not...

c-SIR DEREK FINCHLEY
p-(Interrupting smoothly)
d-We are servants of the Crown, Mr. Finch. And we do what is required.

c-NIGEL
d-But a public concert... the variables are astronomical. An air rifle from the rafters? The wind from the ventilation alone... It's too complex. It's unprofessional.

a-He's latched onto his only possible defense: not morality, but pragmatism.

c-NIGEL (CONT'D)
d-If a job must be done, it must be done simply. A car accident. A faulty gas heater. These are the classics for a reason. They are... tidy.

a-Clive looks personally offended, as if Nigel has just insulted his life's work.

c-CLIVE
d-Tidy? We are composing an elegy, Nigel, not... tidying the garage! It needs psychological resonance! The Palace expects a masterpiece, not a vulgar street crime!

a-Finchley watches the exchange with the detached interest of a scientist observing two different species of insect. He lets the silence hang for a beat, then makes his decision.

c-SIR DEREK FINCHLEY
p-(To Clive)
d-Your methodology is... certainly creative.
p-(To Nigel)
d-And your caution is noted, as always.

a-He stands, straightening his perfectly tailored suit jacket. The briefing is over.

c-SIR DEREK FINCHLEY (CONT'D)
d-I expect a preliminary plan on my desk by Monday.
p-(He looks at Clive, a hint of a smile)
d-Something... memorable.

a-He gives a polite, almost imperceptible nod and exits, closing the door behind him with a soft, final CLICK. He has left no fingerprints.

a-Clive immediately turns back to the chalkboard, a man possessed by his muse, sketching frantically.

a-Nigel sits alone at the table. He stares at his cold cup of tea. He is a man trapped between his duty, his pension, and a conscience he never knew he had. The quiet, bureaucratic melancholy he has carried for years has curdled into pure dread.

s-INT. BUCKINGHAM PALACE PRIVATE STUDY - DAY (FEBRUARY 1970)

a-The room is a mausoleum of masculine tradition. Perfectly ordered, silent, and steeped in the desaturated grey light of a London winter.

a-PRINCE PHILIP (49) stands with military rigidity, examining a large map of the world on the wall. His posture is that of a commander.

a-LORD MOUNTBATTEN (70) is seated, swirling a brandy he has no intention of drinking. He is the patient strategist.

a-SIR DEREK FINCHLEY (59) sits opposite him, bolt upright and deeply uncomfortable. He clutches his slim leather portfolio on his lap like a shield.

c-SIR DEREK FINCHLEY
p-(In his smoothest Whitehall tone)
d-And so, Your Highness, that is the proposed methodology. Codename: 'The Pigeon Gambit'. It leverages the subject's scheduled public performance to provide a... unique operational window.

a-Philip turns from the map. His face is impassive, but his eyes are sharp, analytical.

c-PRINCE PHILIP
d-Theatrical.

a-Mountbatten sighs, a soft, weary sound.

c-LORD MOUNTBATTEN
d-It's convoluted, Philip. It's amateurish. Too many variables. A spotlight. A scream. An antique firearm. One might as well rely on the weather. This isn't strategy; it's a roll of the dice.

c-PRINCE PHILIP
p-(To Finchley)
d-And your man, Barrow, he devised this?

c-SIR DEREK FINCHLEY
d-He was the lead architect on the proposal, yes, sir. He feels it has a certain... psychological resonance.

a-Mountbatten scoffs quietly into his glass.

c-LORD MOUNTBATTEN
d-The objective is neutralization, not grand opera. A simple, professional approach carries far less risk. My great gift is to accelerate the inevitable. This... this invites chaos.

a-Philip walks slowly toward the center of the room. He stops, considering. The entire conspiracy hangs on his decision. Finchley holds his breath.

c-PRINCE PHILIP
d-No.
p-(A beat)
d-I like it.

a-Mountbatten looks up, genuinely surprised. This defies all military and strategic logic.

c-PRINCE PHILIP (CONT'D)
d-Let the little revolutionary be undone by a spectacle. He lives his life as performance art. Let him die by it. There's a certain... symmetry.

a-A small, cruel smile touches Philip's lips. He is no longer the pragmatic guardian of the Crown. He is the author of a revenge plot, savoring the final chapter. He is thinking not like Mountbatten, but like Margaret.

c-LORD MOUNTBATTEN
d-Philip, this is unwise. It is an indulgence.

c-PRINCE PHILIP
p-(His voice like ice)
d-He indulged himself when he sent back my wife's medal with a note about his pop song. The time for prudence is over.

a-He turns to the terrified Finchley.

c-PRINCE PHILIP (CONT'D)
d-Proceed. And ensure there are no loose ends. Your man, Finch, will keep the enthusiast in check?

c-SIR DEREK FINCHLEY
p-(Finding his voice)
d-Mr. Finch is a... stabilizing influence, Your Highness. Yes.

c-PRINCE PHILIP
d-See that he is.

a-Philip turns his back on them, returning to his map. The decision is made. The conversation is over.

a-Sir Derek Finchley gives a stiff, almost imperceptible nod and rises, eager to escape the room's chilling atmosphere.

a-Mountbatten remains seated, staring down into his brandy. He sees his nephew's personal obsession finally eclipse his duty. He has given his advice, it has been rejected, and now he must follow the chain of command, no matter how disastrous the destination.

s-INT. MI5 Q-BRANCH - DAY (FEBRUARY 1970)

a-A cavernous, chilly storeroom in the bowels of Whitehall. Fluorescent lights hum over perfectly aligned rows of grey metal shelving. The shelves are packed with dusty, obsolete Cold War-era equipment, each item bearing a neatly typed label.

a-PERCY DALTON (61) stands behind a long counter, polishing a deactivated landmine with a soft cloth. He wears his usual brown cardigan and a look of profound, eternal irritation.

a-NIGEL FINCH (53) and CLIVE BARROW (46) approach the counter. Clive is practically vibrating with self-importance. Nigel looks as if he's attending his own funeral.

c-CLIVE
p-(With theatrical importance)
d-Percy. We require a long-range, high-velocity pneumatic delivery system. Silenced. With a custom telescopic sight. For... pest control. Top priority.

a-Percy stops polishing. He looks slowly up from the landmine, over the top of his glasses. The look is one of ancient weariness.

c-PERCY
d-Form 18-G. 'Lethal Ordinance Requisition.' Requires sign-off from the Deputy Director and God himself. And we don't have one. Not since the '62 budget cuts.

c-CLIVE
p-(Aghast)
d-But... Operation Elegy is a matter of utmost national importance!

c-PERCY
p-(Unimpressed)
d-Everything is a matter of utmost national importance until it comes time to sign for the damages. What do you have?

a-Nigel slides a perfectly completed, but clearly insufficient, standard equipment form across the counter. Percy inspects it with suspicion.

c-PERCY (CONT'D)
d-'Special Projects.' Very vague. Very convenient.
p-(He sighs, a sound of pure suffering)
d-Wait here.

a-He disappears into the aisles. After a moment of rummaging, he returns, placing a long, canvas-wrapped object on the counter with a heavy, deliberate THUD.

a-He unwraps it to reveal a beautiful, but ancient, German hunting rifle from the 1930s. The woodwork is magnificent, the metalwork gleaming. It belongs in a museum.

c-PERCY (CONT'D)
d-Anschütz .22 Caliber. Confiscated from a Nazi sympathizer in '41. The sights are a bit foggy and it pulls to the left, but she's a lovely piece.

a-Clive stares at the rifle, his grand artistic vision crumbling into dust.

c-CLIVE
d-We are composing a national elegy, Percy, not... going hunting for grouse!

c-PERCY
p-(Ignoring him, running a loving hand over the rifle stock)
d-Now. The important thing. This is a collector's item. You will clean it with the supplied oil—and only the supplied oil—after every use. You will not expose it to damp. And if you lose a single one of these retaining screws, the cost will be deducted from your travel stipend for the next five years.

a-He hands a small, sealed bag containing two tiny screws to Nigel, who accepts it with the gravity of a man receiving a death sentence.

c-CLIVE
p-(Desperately)
d-This is unacceptable! We need precision! We need modernity!

c-PERCY
p-(Leaning forward, his voice a low hiss)
d-You need to sign here. And here. Initial there. And return it in the original canvas. I will be checking.

a-He pushes a clipboard and a fountain pen towards Nigel.

a-Nigel picks up the pen. He can barely contain his relief. The weapon is a joke. It's beautiful, useless, and perfect. He signs the form with a steady hand.

s-INT. CONCERT HALL - DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT (MARCH 1970)

a-A small, cluttered room, warm and organic. Clothes are strewn over chairs. A half-eaten plate of sandwiches sits on a table.

a-JOHN LENNON (30) paces nervously, tuning his acoustic guitar. He wears simple white clothes, looking vulnerable without the armor of The Beatles.

a-YOKO ONO (37), a picture of serenity in matching white, sits perfectly still, watching him.

c-JOHN
d-It feels strange. Doing this without the others. Like I've forgotten how to stand on my own.

c-YOKO
p-(Softly)
d-You are not on your own. You have me. And you have the song. The rest is just... noise.

a-John stops pacing. He looks at her and manages a small, nervous smile.

t-INT. CONCERT HALL - RAFTERS - CONTINUOUS

a-Framed in a cold, symmetrical wide shot. The darkness is absolute, save for a single, low-wattage work light creating a cage of geometric shadows from the steel beams.

a-CLIVE BARROW (46) lies prone on a dusty catwalk. Beside him, ARTHUR JENKINS (52), the Operative, meticulously tries to secure the antique Anschütz rifle to a railing. Arthur's movements are precise and economical; Clive's are twitchy with excitement.

c-ARTHUR
p-(Quietly, reporting a fact)
d-The bracket's not flush. There's a wobble.

c-CLIVE
p-(Hissing)
d-Compensate! An artist works with his materials, Arthur. Now, have you acquired the mark?

a-Arthur sighs, a tiny, almost inaudible puff of air. He squints through the foggy 1930s telescopic sight.

c-ARTHUR
d-Negative. The optics are clouded. It's like looking through a milk bottle.

a-Clive closes his eyes for a second, a man willing his masterpiece into existence through sheer force of will.

t-INT. CONCERT HALL - LIGHTING BOOTH - CONTINUOUS

a-The sterile, humming heart of the theatre's machinery. Banks of levers and dials are arranged with military precision.

a-NIGEL FINCH (53), dressed as a stagehand, stands at the main lighting board, calmly sipping from a thermos of tea.

a-He gives a slow, deliberate nod to a terrified-looking ASSET (20s) at a smaller, secondary board. The Asset swallows hard and nods back, his hands trembling.

t-INT. CONCERT HALL - STAGE - CONTINUOUS

a-The stage is dark. A single microphone stands in a pool of soft, blue light. The vast, expectant silence of the packed hall is a physical presence.

c-ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
d-Ladies and gentlemen, a man who needs no introduction... John Lennon!

a-A roar from the CROWD.

a-John and Yoko walk out from the wings, hand in hand, looking small on the vast stage. They approach the microphone. John positions his guitar. Yoko stands slightly behind him, a silent, supportive presence.

a-The applause dies down. John leans into the microphone.

c-JOHN
p-(His voice echoing slightly)
d-This is for peace.

a-He begins the gentle, instantly recognizable opening chords of "Instant Karma!"

t-INT. CONCERT HALL - RAFTERS - CONTINUOUS

a-It is not a single spotlight.

a-It is a biblical flood of pure, white light. EVERY SINGLE STAGE LIGHT—hundreds of them—slams on at maximum intensity.

a-The stage disappears into an overexposed, blinding white void.

a-The CROWD GASPS, shielding their eyes.

a-John stumbles back from the microphone, blinded, his song faltering.

t-INT. CONCERT HALL - RAFTERS - CONTINUOUS

a-The glare reflects off Arthur's scope, blinding him.

c-ARTHUR
d-Christ! Negative visibility! It's a total washout!

a-Clive stares in horror. This is not his subtle, artistic vision. This is a train wreck.

c-CLIVE
p-(Screaming into his radio)
d-What is happening?! The subtlety! Where is the bloody subtlety?!

t-INT. CONCERT HALL - LIGHTING BOOTH - CONTINUOUS

a-Nigel watches the chaos unfold, his face a perfect mask of bureaucratic indifference. He takes another slow sip of tea.

t-INT. CONCERT HALL - STAGE - CONTINUOUS

a-Yoko Ono does not see a technical fault. She sees a canvas.

a-She steps forward into the center of the blinding white void, a tiny silhouette against the glare. She takes the microphone from its stand.

a-And she lets out a single, piercing, primal SCREAM.

a-It's a sound that rips through the hall, a bolt of pure, avant-garde energy. It is not a scream of fear. It is a scream of art.

a-The audience is stunned into absolute silence. A few people in the front, thinking this is part of the show, begin to applaud uncertainly.

t-INT. CONCERT HALL - RAFTERS - CONTINUOUS

a-Yoko's shriek cuts through Arthur's professional composure. He flinches violently. An involuntary, human reaction to an inhuman sound.

a-His finger jerks on the trigger.

a-The antique rifle FIRES with a quiet *PFFT*.

a-The shot goes wild. It misses the stage entirely, zipping through the darkness and hitting the giant "UNICEF: CONCERT FOR PEACE" banner hanging high above.

a-The bullet tears through the fabric. The "C" in "PEACE" rips and flaps down, dangling by a thread.

a-The message now reads: PEA E.

a-Clive stares at the ruined banner. His masterpiece. His elegy. It's a joke. It's a typo.

c-CLIVE
p-(A choked whisper into his radio)
d-The Pigeon has flown the coop... Abort. Abort the composition.

t-INT. CONCERT HALL - STAGE - CONTINUOUS

a-The blinding lights suddenly cut out, plunging the stage back into a single, soft spotlight.

a-John, recovering his composure, steps back to the microphone. He has no idea what just happened. He thinks it was just... rock and roll.

a-He finishes the final chords of the song.

a-The audience, utterly bewildered by the lights, the scream, and the broken banner, erupts into confused but thunderous applause.

a-John and Yoko take a bow, hand in hand, and walk off stage. They are alive. They are oblivious.

t-INT. CONCERT HALL - BACKSTAGE - CONTINUOUS

a-Nigel calmly places his thermos back in his satchel. He gives a final, blank look toward the stage, then turns and walks away, melting into the chaos of the backstage crew.

a-His face is a portrait of profound, soul-crushing relief. He did his job. He followed his orders. And he saved a man's life with too much light.

s-INT. MI5 DEBRIEFING ROOM - DAY (MARCH 1970)

a-A sterile, windowless room, even more depressing than the safe house. It is designed for institutional blame-shifting.

a-Framed in a stark, deadpan wide shot.

a-PRINCE PHILIP (49) stands ramrod straight, his hands clasped behind his back. He is a study in contained, incandescent fury.

a-SIR DEREK FINCHLEY (59) sits opposite, a picture of calm, corporate concern. His slim portfolio is closed on the table before him.

a-LORD MOUNTBATTEN (70) stands slightly apart, examining a framed photograph of the London skyline as if the conversation is a minor inconvenience.

c-PRINCE PHILIP
p-(His voice dangerously low)
d-A lighting fault. And a lucky shot that hit a banner. That is the official explanation for this... monumental incompetence.

c-SIR DEREK FINCHLEY
p-(Smoothly)
d-The after-action report suggests the assets encountered unforeseen on-site variables, Your Highness. The plan, while creatively ambitious, perhaps lacked the requisite flexibility for a fluid operational environment.

a-Philip turns his head slowly to stare at Finchley.

c-PRINCE PHILIP
d-Do not use that... management jargon with me, Sir Derek. Your men failed. Spectacularly. I want accountability.

c-SIR DEREK FINCHLEY
d-And you shall have it, sir. A full internal review is underway. We are confident we can identify the procedural shortfalls that led to this... sub-optimal outcome.

a-Mountbatten turns from the photograph, his patience finally exhausted.

c-LORD MOUNTBATTEN
d-The outcome wasn't 'sub-optimal,' Derek. It was a farce. And a conspicuous one.
p-(He looks at Philip)
d-The mission is compromised beyond recovery. Any further action is impossible. The assets themselves are now a liability.

c-PRINCE PHILIP
d-They should be court-martialed.

c-LORD MOUNTBATTEN
d-They are not soldiers, Philip, they are civil servants. And more importantly, they are the only two men outside this room who know the operational parameters. You cannot court-martial a secret.

a-Mountbatten's tone is cold, clinical. This is no longer a strategic game; it is a cleanup operation.

c-LORD MOUNTBATTEN (CONT'D)
d-We need to cauterize the wound.

a-Philip stares at him, the military term landing with brutal clarity. Sir Derek nods slightly, understanding his role perfectly.

c-SIR DEREK FINCHLEY
d-Of course. There is a precedent for this. A long-term, remote administrative posting. Reassignment to an oversight role where their... unique experience can be contained. The Falklands desk has two sudden vacancies.

c-PRINCE PHILIP
p-(Scoffs)
d-A desk job? After this fiasco?

c-LORD MOUNTBATTEN
d-It's not a reward, Philip. It's a tomb. They will spend the rest of their careers counting penguins and processing shipping manifests. They will be erased. The operation never happened. The file will be sealed. And we will never speak of it again.

a-The finality in Mountbatten's voice is absolute.

a-Philip's jaw works silently. He has been utterly defeated, not by Lennon, but by the sheer, soul-crushing inertia of the bureaucracy he commands. There will be no victory, no justice, only a quiet, administrative burial.

a-He turns and walks towards the door without another word.

c-SIR DEREK FINCHLEY
p-(To Mountbatten, quietly)
d-I will make the necessary arrangements.

a-Mountbatten simply nods, his gaze distant. The institution has protected itself. That is the only victory that matters.

s-INT. FALKLANDS OFFICE - DAY (MAY 1970)

a-A room of profound, soul-crushing symmetry.

a-Two identical grey metal desks face each other.

a-NIGEL FINCH (53) sits at one. CLIVE BARROW (46) sits at the other.

a-Each man has an identical stack of shipping manifests. Each man is processing them with an identical black fountain pen.

a-Between them, a single grimy window looks out on a vast, empty, windswept landscape of muted greens and browns under a perpetual grey sky. The only sound is the constant, mournful HOWL of the wind.

a-Clive is a broken man. His artistic pretensions have been stripped away, leaving only a hollow shell. He stares blankly at the paperwork, his movements slow and mechanical.

a-Nigel, by contrast, seems almost at peace. He processes his forms with the same quiet, methodical precision he has applied to everything. This is just another desk. This is just another job.

a-On a filing cabinet, a small, crackly transistor radio plays softly.

c-RADIO NEWSCASTER (V.O.)
d-...and in London today, the end of an era. Solicitors for Paul McCartney have confirmed he has filed a lawsuit to formally dissolve The Beatles' partnership. A spokesman for the group cited personal and artistic differences...

a-Clive stops writing. He slowly places his pen down, perfectly parallel to the edge of his desk. He stares out the window at the desolate landscape. His masterpiece, his five-year opera, has ended with this pathetic, tinny announcement in a forgotten office at the bottom of the world.

c-CLIVE
p-(To the window, a dead voice)
d-It should have been a masterpiece.

a-Nigel looks up from his work. He shows no triumph, no satisfaction. Only a deep, weary pity for the man opposite him.

a-He takes a slow sip of his tea, then returns to his paperwork. The scratching of his pen is the only sound, a quiet counterpoint to the relentless wind.

a-The camera holds on the miserable, perfect symmetry of the room, two men in their bureaucratic tomb, forever bound by a secret war that never officially happened.

purpose: "The thematic resolution. The chaotic artist and the obsessed royal have both been exhausted by the conflict, but the soulless, patient machinery of the state grinds on, unchanged."
conflict: "The Queen's quiet, institutional wisdom versus Philip's defeated, personal rage. The final, unspoken power dynamic of their marriage and their roles."

notes: "The dialogue is minimal. The story is told through the Queen's quiet actions and Philip's defeated posture. Her focus on the mundane (the crossword) is her ultimate power play."

t-FADE IN:

s-INT. QUEEN'S SITTING ROOM - DAY (MAY 1970)

a-A room of profound, unshakable calm. Sunlight streams through tall windows, illuminating a space of soft colors, floral patterns, and perfectly ordered family photographs.

a-A corgi sleeps soundly in a basket by the fireplace.

a-QUEEN ELIZABETH II (44) sits in a comfortable armchair, working on a crossword puzzle from *The Times*. She is the picture of serene focus.

a-PRINCE PHILIP (49) enters. He looks utterly defeated. The military rigidity is gone, replaced by the weary slump of a man who has lost a long and pointless war.

a-He stands in the middle of the room, adrift. The Queen does not look up from her puzzle.

c-THE QUEEN
p-(Quietly, to the paper)
d-Seven down. 'A temporary folly'. Nine letters.

a-She fills in the answer with a small, neat pencil. Philip says nothing. The silence stretches.

a-Finally, she sets the newspaper aside and looks at him. Her expression is not angry, not triumphant. It is simply weary.

c-THE QUEEN (CONT'D)
d-Is it over?

c-PRINCE PHILIP
p-(A hoarse whisper)
d-Yes.

c-THE QUEEN
d-You went too far, Philip. You let your pride cloud your judgment. You forgot the most important rule.

a-She rises calmly and moves to a side table, adjusting a silver-framed photograph of her father by a fraction of an inch. A small, perfect act of order.

c-THE QUEEN (CONT'D)
d-The Crown does not hold grudges. It has no time for them. It simply... endures.

a-She turns back to him. Her gaze is steady, clear, and absolute.

c-THE QUEEN (CONT'D)
d-They were a pop group. They were always going to burn out. All we ever had to do was wait.

a-The simple, devastating truth of it hangs in the air between them. His five years of rage, conspiracy, and obsession... all for nothing. All to achieve an outcome that was already inevitable.

a-She returns to her chair, picks up her crossword, and makes another small, precise entry.

a-He has been dismissed.

a-He stands alone in the center of the room, a man who tried to command history and was swept aside by it. He turns and slowly exits, leaving the Queen to her puzzle and the quiet, enduring order of her room.

purpose: "To deliver the final, satirical gut-punch. History is not shaped by grand conspiracies, but by tragic, senseless absurdity."

status: "draft"
notes: "The visual and tonal shift from the warm montage to the cold final scene is everything. The final look between Nigel and Clive must be unreadable but heavy with the weight of their shared, useless secret."

t-MONTAGE

a-The simple, hopeful piano intro of "Imagine" begins to play. The visual style is warm, grainy, organic 16mm footage.

t-EXT. TITTENHURST PARK - DAY (1971)

a-JOHN and YOKO, dressed in white, walk hand-in-hand through a misty garden. John is smiling, genuinely at peace.

t-EXT. PAUL'S FARM, SCOTLAND - DAY (MID-70s)

a-PAUL, bearded and wearing a thick jumper, laughs as he gives his young daughter a piggyback ride through a field of wildflowers. He is a father. A husband. A man far from the chaos.

t-EXT. FRIAR PARK GARDENS - DAY (MID-70s)

a-GEORGE, his hair long, patiently tends to his magnificent garden. He looks up at the sun, a quiet, contemplative smile on his face. He has found his own kind of enlightenment.

t-EXT. FILM SET - DAY (MID-70s)

a-Ringo, in a flamboyant costume, shares a joke with a fellow actor. He throws his head back and laughs, a picture of uncomplicated joy.

a-The piano melody continues, full of hope and possibility...

a-And then, ABRUPTLY, it cuts to:

t-INT. FALKLANDS OFFICE - NIGHT (DECEMBER 8, 1980)

a-The sound of the relentless, howling WIND.

a-The room is exactly the same, but ten years have passed. It is a tomb of perfect, miserable symmetry.

a-An older NIGEL (63) and an older CLIVE (56) sit at their identical desks under the harsh fluorescent glare. They are greyer, heavier. Their movements are slow, worn down by a decade of monotony.

a-The small transistor radio on the filing cabinet crackles.

c-RADIO NEWSCASTER (V.O.)
d-...we are interrupting this program with breaking news. Reports from New York are confirming that John Lennon, the musician and former Beatle, has been shot and killed outside his Manhattan apartment building. Police have a suspect in custody, described as a 'deranged fan'...

a-Nigel slowly stops writing. He looks up from his paperwork. He stares across the small, miserable room at Clive.

a-Clive's face is a blank mask. He betrayed his country, his conscience, and his career for a mission that ended in farce. And now, a random madman has achieved with a single, vulgar act what all the machinery of the state could not.

a-The ultimate, cosmic joke.

a-They just look at each other. Two old men in a forgotten office at the bottom of the world. The only two people on Earth who know the absurd, secret war that was fought and lost for absolutely nothing.

a-The camera holds on their faces as the sound of the wind HOWLS outside.

t-FADE TO BLACK.

a-Over the black screen, a final, stark white title card appears:

a-There is no evidence the British Monarchy or intelligence services had any involvement in the death of John Lennon.

t-FINAL SCENE
