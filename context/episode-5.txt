s-INT. PAUL MCCARTNEY'S HOME, CAVENDISH AVENUE - DAY (NOVEMBER 1969)
a-A sanctuary of curated calm. Sunlight streams into the living room, illuminating a space that is both a creative workshop and a family haven. A grand piano sits in the corner. Guitars are on stands. The room is tidy, warm, domestic.
a-PAUL MCCARTNEY (27) sits on a plush sofa, strumming a gentle, unformed melody on an acoustic guitar. He looks relaxed, a rare moment of peace.
a-LINDA EASTMAN (28), camera around her neck, smiles as she watches him. Their young daughter, HEATHER, plays quietly on the floor with wooden blocks.
c-LINDA
d-That's a nice one. What is it?
c-PAUL
p-(Shrugs, smiling)
d-Don't know yet. It's just... there.
a-The gentle CLATTER of the letterbox flap breaks the quiet.
c-LINDA
d-Post is here.
a-She gets up and retrieves a small stack of mail from the floor. She flips through it. Bills, fan mail... and one other.
c-LINDA (CONT'D)
d-Oh. This one looks important.
a-She hands him a thick, cream-colored envelope. It bears a royal crest, embossed in gold. It's addressed simply to "P. McCartney, Esq."
a-Paul puts his guitar aside. He takes the envelope, a flicker of curiosity on his face. He studies the crest.
c-PAUL
d-Blimey. What's this then?
a-He carefully breaks the wax seal with his thumbnail and pulls out a single sheet of heavy, watermarked paper.
a-He reads. His eyes widen. A slow, incredulous smile spreads across his face. He looks up at Linda, completely stunned.
c-PAUL (CONT'D)
d-You're not going to believe this.
c-LINDA
d-What is it?
c-PAUL
p-(Reading aloud, his voice a mix of awe and disbelief)
d-"...Her Majesty the Queen has been graciously pleased to approve the recommendation that you be appointed a Knight Bachelor... for your services to music..."
a-He lets the letter fall to his lap, shaking his head.
c-PAUL (CONT'D)
d-A knighthood. They want to make me a knight.
a-Linda's face breaks into a huge, delighted grin. She throws her arms around him.
c-LINDA
d-Paul, that's incredible! Sir Paul! Oh, my God!
a-Paul laughs, a genuine, joyful sound. He hugs her back tightly. For a moment, he is purely happy. The honor, the recognition. His dad would have been so proud.
c-PAUL
d-"Arise, Sir Paul..."
p-(He chuckles)
d-Can you believe it?
a-He picks up the letter again, re-reading it. The smile on his face slowly begins to fade. The joy is replaced by a creeping puzzlement.
c-PAUL (CONT'D)
p-(More to himself)
d-But... why? Why now?
c-LINDA
d-What do you mean, 'why'? Because you're a genius! You deserve it.
c-PAUL
d-No, I mean... the timing. The band's a mess. John's... well, he's John. It feels... odd.
a-His mind starts to race. The warm, safe room suddenly feels colder.
t-QUICK FLASHBACK - INT. INDICA GALLERY - DAY (1968)
a-A subjective memory. Paul's POV. He sees YOKO across the gallery. She's in deep, intense conversation with KLAUS (CLIVE). The audio is distorted, muffled. Klaus leans in, his gestures sharp, conspiratorial. It doesn't look like a chat about art. It looks like a briefing.
t-BACK TO SCENE
a-Paul's expression has hardened. The pieces are clicking into place in his mind, but they're all the wrong pieces.
c-PAUL
d-That German bloke. At Yoko's gallery.
c-LINDA
d-The art critic? Klaus?
c-PAUL
d-He wasn't a critic. He was something else. They've been meeting. Whispering. And now this...
p-(He holds up the letter as if it's evidence)
d-...this arrives.
a-Linda looks at him, completely lost.
c-LINDA
d-Paul, what are you talking about? This is a good thing.
c-PAUL
p-(Shaking his head, his voice low and urgent)
d-Don't you see? It's not a reward, Linda. It's a weapon.
a-He stands up, pacing the room. His sanctuary has been violated.
c-PAUL (CONT'D)
d-They're trying to split us. It's her. She's got her hooks in him, turning him against everything we were. And now the establishment... they're helping her.
a-His paranoia is now a torrent.
c-PAUL (CONT'D)
d-They make him the revolutionary clown, the one who's gone mad. And me? They make me 'Sir Paul'. The good one. The safe one. The one who plays by the rules. It drives a wedge right down the middle of us.
a-He stops pacing and looks at the letter in his hand with utter disgust. The honor has become a brand, a mark of treason against his friend.
c-PAUL (CONT'D)
p-(Quietly, fiercely)
d-They are not taking him from me.
a-He crushes the letter slightly in his fist. The melody he was strumming is forgotten. The domestic peace is shattered.
a-Linda watches him, her face a mask of worry. She sees a man she loves retreating into a world of suspicion she cannot enter.
t-FADE OUT.

s-INT. APPLE CORPS BOARDROOM - DAY (NOVEMBER 1969)
a-The room is stylish, expensive, and cold. The four Beatles are assembled around a large, polished table. The mood is thick with dread.
a-PAUL (27) paces at the head of the table, radiating a tense, aggressive energy. In his hand is the crumpled, forged knighthood letter.
a-JOHN (29) sits opposite, utterly disengaged. He doodles on a notepad. YOKO (36) is beside him, a silent, still presence.
a-GEORGE (26) stares out the window at Savile Row, having already mentally left the room.
a-RINGO (29) sits between them all, anxiously tapping his fingers on the table, the unwilling witness to a family's collapse.
c-PAUL
p-(Stopping his pacing)
d-Right. I called this meeting because things have gone too far. There are... forces at play here. Trying to tear us apart. And we need to face it.
a-His eyes are fixed on Yoko. John doesn't look up from his doodle.
c-JOHN
p-(Muttering)
d-Here we go. St. Paul's sermon on the mount.
c-PAUL
p-(Ignoring him, his voice rising)
d-I'm serious, John! You can't see it because you're too close to it, but I can. The whispers. The outsiders. The way they're trying to turn you against me. Against us.
a-He gestures vaguely with the letter, the "evidence" for his paranoid theory. He is so full of righteous fury, he's practically shaking.
c-PAUL (CONT'D)
d-This isn't about music anymore. This is about... infiltration. And we have to fight it. We have to be a band again.
a-He looks around the table, pleading. But no one meets his eye. He's trying to rally troops who have already deserted.
a-Before Paul can present his "evidence," John slowly puts his pencil down. He looks up, not at Paul, but at the center of the table. His expression is flat, devoid of emotion.
c-JOHN
d-I'm leaving the group.
a-The words hang in the air, simple and brutal. Paul stops dead. His entire argument, his whole paranoid structure, collapses into dust.
c-PAUL
p-(Confused)
d-What? What are you talking about? We're talking about how to save it...
c-JOHN
p-(Cutting him off, still calm)
d-No, *you're* talking about how to save it. I'm not. It's over.
p-(He looks at Paul for the first time)
d-I want a divorce.
a-The room falls into a stunning, absolute silence.
a-Paul's face goes blank with shock. He came in for a fight, armed and ready, only to find the war was long over.
a-George turns from the window. A small, almost imperceptible nod. A quiet exhale of relief. He's free.
a-Ringo's face crumples. He looks utterly heartbroken.
t-CUT TO:
s-INT. MI5 SURVEILLANCE VAN - CONTINUOUS
a-NIGEL (52) and CLIVE (45) listen through their headphones.
c-CLIVE
p-(Tearing his headset off, leaping to his feet in the cramped space)
d-YES! HE SAID IT! HE SAID THE THING!
p-(He punches the air)
d-SUCCESSFUL FRACTURING! OPERATIONAL OBJECTIVE ACHIEVED! THE KLAUS METHODOLOGY WORKS!
a-Nigel doesn't move. He slowly takes off his own headphones, placing them carefully on the console. He closes his eyes, pinching the bridge of his nose. The weight of the last four years settles on him. There is no triumph on his face, only a profound, weary sadness.
t-BACK TO SCENE
a-In the boardroom, the silence stretches. Paul sinks into a chair, the crumpled letter falling from his hand onto the table. It lies there, a pathetic, meaningless prop.
c-PAUL
p-(A whisper)
d-...a divorce?
c-JOHN
p-(Standing up, Yoko rising with him)
d-It was fun while it lasted.
a-He says it without malice or sentiment. It's just a fact. He walks toward the door, not looking back. The band is already in his past.
a-Paul watches him go, completely and utterly blindsided. The real conspiracy wasn't the one he imagined. It was the one he never saw.

s-INT. POST OFFICE, LONDON - DAY (NOVEMBER 25, 1969)
a-The echoing hall is the epitome of civil service indifference. Harsh fluorescent lights reflect off the worn linoleum floors. A queue of people shuffles forward with practiced patience.
a-JOHN LENNON (29) and YOKO ONO (36) stand in the queue. Dressed in simple dark coats, they blend in. John clutches a small, plain cardboard box.
a-They reach the counter. Behind the glass partition sits BRENDA (45), a woman who looks as if she were born into her postal worker's uniform. She's been stamping forms since the dawn of time.
c-BRENDA
p-(Without looking up)
d-Next, please.
a-John slides the small box through the opening at the bottom of the glass.
c-JOHN
p-(Quietly)
d-This is for Buckingham Palace.
a-Brenda eyes the box, then John, with no flicker of recognition. It's just another address.
c-BRENDA
d-Contents?
a-John pauses for a beat.
c-JOHN
d-A medal.
a-Brenda makes a bored tick on a form. She's processed stranger things before lunch.
c-BRENDA
d-Right. Needs to go recorded. That'll be one and six.
a-John pays. As Brenda begins the mechanical process of her job—weighing the package, selecting a stamp, consulting a chart—we hear John's voice, calm and resolute.
c-JOHN (V.O.)
d-Your Majesty, I am returning this MBE as a protest against Britain's involvement in the Nigeria-Biafra thing...
a-Brenda licks a stamp with a practiced flick of her tongue and places it precisely on the box.
c-JOHN (V.O.)
d-...against our support of America in Vietnam...
a-She picks up her heavy rubber stamp and brings it down with a loud, final, echoing THUD.
c-JOHN (V.O.)
d-...and against 'Cold Turkey' slipping down the charts. With love, John Lennon of Bag.
a-The transaction is complete. Brenda slides the box off the counter and drops it unceremoniously into a large canvas mail sack beside her.
a-It lands with a dull, anticlimactic THUD.
a-Brenda is already looking past them, her focus on the next person in the queue. Her duty to John Lennon is done.
c-BRENDA
d-Next.
a-John and Yoko turn and walk away, hand in hand. They disappear into the anonymous London crowd.
a-The camera lingers on the mail sack, filled with ordinary parcels. Inside, a symbol of rebellion begins its quiet, bureaucratic journey to the heart of the establishment.

s-INT. BUCKINGHAM PALACE PRIVATE STUDY - DAY (LATE NOVEMBER 1969)
a-A sanctuary of austere, masculine power. The room is quiet, heavy with the weight of tradition.
a-PRINCE PHILIP (48) stands with LORD MOUNTBATTEN (69), examining a naval chart. Philip looks smug, controlled. Operation Minuet is a success. The band is broken. He has won.
a-The door opens and an AIDE enters, carrying a small, plain cardboard box on a silver tray.
c-AIDE
d-A package, Your Royal Highness. From the post room. Marked for Her Majesty's attention.
a-He places the tray on the heavy mahogany desk.
a-Philip glances at it, dismissive. Mountbatten shows a flicker of professional interest.
a-At that moment, QUEEN ELIZABETH II (43) and PRINCESS MARGARET (39) enter. The Queen carries a small stack of correspondence. Margaret drifts in behind her, a cigarette holder in hand.
c-THE QUEEN
p-(To the Aide)
d-Thank you, Robert.
p-(To Philip)
d-More charts? One would think you were planning another war.
a-She spots the box on the tray.
c-THE QUEEN (CONT'D)
d-What's this?
a-She picks up the small, unimpressive box. There is a simple letter attached. She opens the letter and begins to read. Her expression remains utterly neutral, a mask of practiced composure.
a-Philip watches her, a triumphant glint in his eye. This is the final report from the front. The enemy's unconditional surrender.
a-The Queen finishes reading. She looks up, her face betraying nothing.
c-THE QUEEN (CONT'D)
p-(Quietly)
d-Well. That's that, I suppose.
a-She hands the letter to Philip. Margaret leans over his shoulder, eager for the drama.
a-Philip takes the letter, his face a mask of smug satisfaction. He reads.
t-CLOSE ON THE LETTER. We see John's handwriting.
a-As Philip's eyes scan the text, his expression transforms. The smugness evaporates, replaced by confusion, then disbelief, then a deep, cold, incandescent rage.
c-JOHN (V.O.)
d-...as a protest against Britain's involvement in the Nigeria-Biafra thing, against our support of America in Vietnam...
a-Philip's jaw tightens. This isn't a surrender. It's a list of demands.
c-JOHN (V.O.) (CONT'D)
d-...and against 'Cold Turkey' slipping down the charts.
a-The final line hits Philip like a physical blow. The petty, narcissistic absurdity of it. The insolence.
a-Margaret lets out a low whistle, a sound of pure theatrical appreciation.
c-PRINCESS MARGARET
d-Oh, that's magnificent. "Cold Turkey"! He's mocking you. It's perfectly ghastly. I adore it.
a-Philip is no longer listening. He's staring at the letter, his knuckles white. He thought he had broken Lennon. Instead, Lennon has rejected *him*. He has taken Philip's victory and used it as a platform for his own grubby politics.
c-THE QUEEN
p-(Calmly)
d-It's an emotional gesture from an emotional young man. It will be a footnote in a week. The best response is no response.
a-But Philip is beyond reason. He crushes the letter in his fist.
c-PRINCE PHILIP
p-(His voice a low, dangerous growl)
d-No response? He didn't just return it. He spat on it.
p-(He looks at the Queen, his eyes burning)
d-He spat on *you*.
c-THE QUEEN
p-(Firmly)
d-He spat on a symbol, Philip. It is my job to be a symbol. It's a singer having a tantrum. Let it go.
c-PRINCE PHILIP
d-Let it go? We spent four years on this. We fractured them. We drove him to this. And he turns it into a... a press release for his wretched song!
a-He throws the crumpled letter onto the desk. He looks at Mountbatten, his face a mask of cold fury. The game is over.
c-PRINCE PHILIP (CONT'D)
d-He has made himself a political figure. A martyr. He's more dangerous now than he ever was with a guitar. This isn't over.
c-THE QUEEN
p-(A warning tone)
d-Philip. Be careful.
c-PRINCESS MARGARET
p-(A delighted whisper)
d-Oh, I do hope he won't be. This is getting frightfully interesting.
a-Philip ignores them both. His eyes are locked on Mountbatten's, his decision made. The personal insult has become a matter of national security. The protector of the realm has become its most dangerous zealot.

t-FADE IN:
s-INT. BUCKINGHAM PALACE PRIVATE STUDY - NIGHT (LATE NOVEMBER 1969)
a-The room is dark, save for a single green-shaded lamp on the heavy desk, casting long, menacing shadows. The atmosphere is funereal.
a-PRINCE PHILIP (48) stands by the fireplace, staring into the flames. He is unnervingly still. The explosive rage from the afternoon has cooled into something far more dangerous: icy, resolute calm.
a-LORD MOUNTBATTEN (69) sits in a leather armchair, a glass of brandy untouched beside him.
a-SIR DEREK FINCHLEY (58), the Deputy Director of MI5, sits opposite him, looking deeply uneasy. He holds a slim, empty portfolio on his lap. He was summoned, not invited.
a-The QUEEN is notably absent. This is not a state matter anymore. This is personal.
c-MOUNTBATTEN
p-(Breaking the silence)
d-The press is treating it as a celebrity tantrum. The Times called the 'Cold Turkey' reference 'gauche'. In a week, it will be forgotten. In a strategic sense, the operation was a success. The group is fractured beyond repair. The primary objective has been met.
a-Philip turns slowly from the fire. His face is a mask.
c-PRINCE PHILIP
d-The primary objective? Was it?
p-(He walks slowly toward the desk)
d-The objective, as I recall, was to neutralize a nuisance. To remind these people of the proper order of things.
a-He stops, looking down at Finchley, who shrinks slightly under his gaze.
c-PRINCE PHILIP (CONT'D)
d-Instead, we have created a political symbol. We have spent four years turning a court jester into a Joan of Arc. He's more dangerous now than he ever was with a guitar.
c-MOUNTBATTEN
d-He's a musician, Philip. His influence is... ephemeral.
c-PRINCE PHILIP
p-(A sharp, cold laugh)
d-Is it? He's met with prime ministers. He holds press conferences about world peace from a bed. He has the ear of an entire generation. And now, he has a legitimate grievance. He has our attention. And we gave it to him.
a-Finchley shifts uncomfortably in his chair. He is a bureaucrat, a man of plausible deniability. This conversation is becoming dangerously concrete.
c-SIR DEREK FINCHLEY
d-Your Highness, MI5's official assessment is that while Lennon is a person of interest, he does not constitute a direct threat to national—
c-PRINCE PHILIP
p-(Cutting him off, his voice like ice)
d-Your 'official assessment' is a document designed to protect your pension, Sir Derek. I am talking about reality.
p-(He leans on the desk, his voice dropping)
d-The man has publicly accused the Crown of complicity in war. He has used an honour from the Sovereign as a political weapon. He is no longer a nuisance. He is a dissident. And dissidents... must be managed.
a-Mountbatten senses where this is going. He sits up, his expression hardening.
c-MOUNTBATTEN
d-Philip, we must be exceedingly careful here. Any overt action would be catastrophic.
c-PRINCE PHILIP
d-I am not suggesting an overt action. I am suggesting a final one.
a-The room goes utterly still. Finchley looks like he wants to dissolve into the floor. This is a line he never, ever wanted to cross.
c-PRINCE PHILIP (CONT'D)
d-Operation Minuet was a success in its tactics, but its strategy was flawed. It was a dance. It was about disruption. The terms have now changed.
a-He looks directly at Mountbatten, the command clear in his eyes.
c-PRINCE PHILIP (CONT'D)
d-Operation Minuet is terminated. Effective immediately.
p-(He pauses, letting the finality sink in)
d-We are activating a new protocol. Operation... 'Elegy'.
c-MOUNTBATTEN
p-(Quietly)
d-An elegy is a funeral song.
c-PRINCE PHILIP
d-Precisely. This is no longer about disruption, Dickie. This is about silencing a threat. Permanently.
a-Sir Derek Finchley visibly pales. This is no longer a cynical game of psychological manipulation. This is a royal directive for an assassination.
c-SIR DEREK FINCHLEY
p-(Stammering)
d-Your... Your Highness... that is... such a measure would be... unprecedented. The blowback...
c-PRINCE PHILIP
p-(Straightening up, his voice regaining its command)
d-The blowback for allowing a public figure to repeatedly and publicly defy the Crown is far greater. That is the very definition of sedition.
p-(To Mountbatten)
d-I want a plan. Quiet. Plausible. Final. Use the same assets. They are already compromised.
a-Mountbatten stares at his nephew, seeing the full extent of his obsession. The protector of the monarchy has become its greatest liability. But an order has been given.
c-MOUNTBATTEN
p-(After a long silence, a slight, almost imperceptible nod)
d-As you wish.
a-Philip turns back to the fire, his back to them both. The decision is made. The conversation is over.
a-Finchley sits frozen, clutching his portfolio, a man trapped in a waking nightmare. He has just become accessory to a plot he wants no part of, ordered by a man he cannot refuse.

s-INT. MI5 SAFE HOUSE - NIGHT (LATE NOVEMBER 1969)
a-The room is cold, lit by a single bare bulb. The air is stale with the ghosts of a thousand sordid secrets.
a-SIR DEREK FINCHLEY (58), NIGEL FINCH (52), and CLIVE BARROW (45) sit around a cheap wooden table. An overflowing ashtray sits between them. Finchley looks as if he's just swallowed something foul but is maintaining his professional composure.
a-The mood is funereal.
c-SIR DEREK FINCHLEY
p-(Clears his throat)
d-Gentlemen. I have just come from a meeting at the highest level. A strategic reassessment has been made. Operation Minuet has been... concluded.
a-Clive looks momentarily confused, a schoolboy whose favorite game has been cancelled. Nigel says nothing, his face a mask of weary anticipation.
c-SIR DEREK FINCHLEY (CONT'D)
d-The operation's primary objective—the fracturing of the group—has been achieved. However, recent actions by the primary subject, Lennon, have created an unforeseen complication.
a-He opens a slim portfolio. It contains a single sheet of paper.
c-SIR DEREK FINCHLEY (CONT'D)
d-It is now the Palace's view that the subject no longer represents a cultural nuisance, but a political one. As such, a new directive has been issued.
a-He slides the paper across the table. It's a memo, typed, with no letterhead and no signature. It is a ghost.
c-SIR DEREK FINCHLEY (CONT'D)
d-The subject's file is to be closed. His activities are to be brought to a final conclusion. The matter is to be... permanently retired.
a-He delivers the lines in a flat, bureaucratic monotone. A man reading a weather report.
a-Clive leans forward, reading the memo. His eyes scan the euphemisms. A slow, strange smile spreads across his face. His eyes light up with a manic, creative glee.
c-CLIVE
p-(A hushed, reverent whisper)
d-A permanent resolution. My God. It's the third act.
a-Nigel stares at Finchley, his mind struggling to process the words.

d-Retired? Sir, I'm not sure I understand the... operational parameters.

d-I think you do, Nigel.
a-The truth lands. Nigel feels the blood drain from his face. He looks physically ill.
c-NIGEL
p-(Shaking his head, slowly)
d-No. Sir, with respect... that's not... that is not what we do. We are an intelligence service, not... not that.
c-CLIVE
p-(Interrupting, his mind already racing)
d-It's a question of methodology, Nigel! A final exit. It requires... artistry. A performance piece. Something public, but misdirecting. A charity concert, perhaps? The dramatic irony would be... sublime.
a-Nigel stares at Clive, horrified. Clive isn't seeing a man; he's seeing a plot point.
c-NIGEL
p-(To Finchley, pleading)
d-Sir Derek. This is assassination.
a-He says the word. The ugly, simple truth that Finchley's elegant euphemisms were designed to hide. The word hangs in the dead air of the room.
a-Finchley's pleasant mask cracks, just for a second. His eyes turn to steel.
c-SIR DEREK FINCHLEY
d-This is a royal directive, Mr. Finch. This is not a request. It is not a debate. It is an order. Are you a loyal servant of the Crown, or are you not?
a-The threat is absolute, unspoken but perfectly clear.
c-NIGEL
d-I am a loyal servant. But this is... wrong.
c-SIR DEREK FINCHLEY
p-(Leaning forward, his voice a silken threat)
d-What is 'wrong' is a matter for philosophers. We are professionals. You have a few years left until your pension. One would hate to see such a long and... adequate career end on a note of insubordination. Consider your options. Carefully.
a-He stands, straightening his suit. The briefing is over.
c-SIR DEREK FINCHLEY (CONT'D)
d-I expect a preliminary plan on my desk by Monday.
p-(He looks at Clive)
d-Something... creative.
a-He exits, closing the door behind him with a soft CLICK.
a-Clive immediately pulls out a notebook and starts sketching frantically, muttering to himself.
c-CLIVE
d-The stage... the lighting... a distraction in the crowd... it has to be a masterpiece...
a-Nigel doesn't move. He sits at the table, utterly defeated. The bumbling comedy is over. He is now the partner of a killer-in-waiting, and an accessory to a state-sanctioned murder.
a-His face is a portrait of a man trapped between his duty, his pension, and a conscience he never knew he had until this exact moment. The path forward contains only terrible choices.
t-FADE OUT.
