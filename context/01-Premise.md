# Premise

## Loglines

### Option 1 - Balanced, Buyer-Friendly
- After The Beatles receive MBEs in 1965, a wounded Prince Philip quietly authorizes MI5 to neutralize the band as a growing political embarrassment. Tasked with the operation, two ill-suited intelligence officers stumble through a multi-year campaign of sabotage that escalates alongside John Lennon’s radicalization—until bureaucratic inertia pushes the mission toward consequences no one can fully control.

### Option 2 - Sharper Stirical Signal (More Conrad / Iannucci)
- When The Beatles are awarded MBEs in 1965, Prince Philip responds not with pride but by quietly unleashing MI5 to rein them in. Caught between royal paranoia and John Lennon’s growing rebellion, two hapless intelligence officers oversee a campaign that exposes how petty grudges, bad paperwork, and institutional absurdity can reshape history.

## Tone

The tone of the screenplay is dark, cynical, and greatly satirical, with key focuses on the power dynamics between the royal family and the Beatles and on the absurdity of the royal institutions, the characters, and the situations they find themselves in. It should remain historically accurate regarding actual events and dates in the script when possible, but should take liberties to create a more dramatic and engaging story, as well as create the fictional plot points when needed.

## Core Themes

- Power vs. Art: The central conflict between the rigid, inherited power of the state and the chaotic, earned influence of a creative individual. Does true art always threaten established power?
- The Absurdity of Bureaucracy: The story satirizes the idea that grand historical events can be influenced by petty grudges, flawed paperwork, and incompetent middle-managers. The real enemy isn't malice, but institutional folly.
- Myth vs. Reality: The public myth of The Beatles and the Royal Family versus the private, dysfunctional reality of both "families."
- The Nature of Rebellion: Is rebellion a grand political statement or a deeply personal, almost childish, act of defiance? The story explores both sides through John's character.

## Visual Language

The film's visual language is a deliberate clash of two worlds, inspired by the work of Wes Anderson and Steven Conrad.

- The Royal/MI5 World: Characterized by rigid symmetry, desaturated and melancholic color palettes (greys, muted blues, pale yellows), and meticulously ordered but dusty production design. Framing is often deadpan, flat, and wide, emphasizing the sterile absurdity of the environment. Think *Patriot*.
- The Beatles' World: More chaotic, warmer, and organic. Handheld or fluid camera movements during creative sessions. The spaces are cluttered with instruments, art, and life. The aesthetic becomes progressively more casual and counter-culture as the story progresses.
- Visual Irony: The comedy often comes from a visually chaotic element (Yoko's art, a clumsy spy) being introduced into a rigidly composed Royal frame.

## Tonal & Structural Comps

- *Patriot (Steven Conrad):* For its deadpan humor, bureaucratic melancholy, and the depiction of intelligence work as a soul-crushing office job.
- *The Royal Tenenbaums (Wes Anderson):* For its portrayal of a dysfunctional, iconic family, its specific visual aesthetic, and its blend of comedy with genuine pathos.
- *The Death of Stalin (Armando Iannucci):* For its sharp, satirical take on a powerful institution in crisis and its depiction of powerful figures as petty, incompetent, and self-serving.

## Central Dramatic Question

Can an individual artist's authentic, chaotic rebellion survive a confrontation with the soulless, absurd machinery of the state, or will both be transformed by the encounter?

## Setting

The screenplay's primary narrative spans from 1965 to 1970. It begins in London with The Beatles receiving their MBEs, follows a covert, multi-year campaign against them, and culminates in a failed assassination attempt in 1970. The epilogue occurs in the mid-1970s, showing the characters having mostly settled into their lives. The story concludes with a title card: "John Lennon was assassinated by Mark David Chapman on December 8, 1980. There is no evidence that the royal family had any involvement."
