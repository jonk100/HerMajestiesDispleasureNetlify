# General Guidelines for Script Length

## 🎬 **Scenes**

**Typical Length:** 1–3 pages

* **Rule of thumb:** 1 page = \~1 minute of screen time
* **Purpose:** Each scene usually shows a clear action, decision, or character interaction.
* **Short scenes** (under 1 page) can add energy or tension.
* **Long scenes** (3+ pages) should feel earned and be emotionally or dramatically weighty.

> ✅ Best Practice: Vary scene lengths to keep rhythm natural, but be wary of back-to-back long scenes.

## 📚 **Sequences**

**Typical Length:** 5–10 pages

* A **sequence** is a series of related scenes that build toward a mini-goal or reversal.
* Think of them like **chapters** in your film.
* Most feature-length films have **8–12 sequences**, each functioning as a narrative block.

> ✅ Best Practice: End each sequence with a mini-climax or turn that propels the story forward.

## 🎭 **Acts**

**3-Act Structure (industry standard):**

| Act         | Length | Pages (for 100–110 page script) | Purpose                                       |
| ----------- | ------ | ------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| **Act I**   | \~25%  | Pages 1–25                      | Setup – Introduce characters, world, conflict |
| **Act II**  | \~50%  | Pages 25–85                     | Confrontation – Rising stakes, complications  |
| **Act III** | \~25%  | Pages 85–110                    | Resolution – Climax and fallout               |

* **Act II** is usually split into two halves with a **midpoint twist** (around page 55).
* **Turning points** occur at the end of Acts I and II (plot points 1 and 2).

> ✅ Best Practice: Don't treat these divisions as strict borders, but as structural waypoints to keep your narrative on track.
