**SCENE 15: "A More Theatrical Approach"** - BUCKINGHAM PALACE PRIVATE STUDY - DAY (Late 1966)

- A Committee meeting. Mountbatten gives a dry update. Princess Margaret, theatrically bored, dismisses the strategy as "frightfully dull."
- Having learned of Paul's solo score for *The Family Way*, she proposes a new angle: "Encourage the delusion." She suggests they use MI5 assets to plant positive reviews, feeding Paul's ego to further alienate the anti-establishment John.
- Philip, intrigued by the psychological cruelty, agrees.
- **PURPOSE:** Re-engage the antagonists, showcase Margaret's character, and weaponize the band's own creative evolution against them.
- **PAGE COUNT:** 3 pages

- In his office, Nigel grimly opens a new file. The mission just got infinitely easier, and more dangerous.

- **PAGE COUNT:** 2 pages

- Paul receives an expertly forged letter from MI5 offering him a knighthood.
- This is Nigel's masterstroke. Instead of being honored, Paul is instantly paranoid, believing it's a plot to turn the establishment against John, for Yoko. He sees the "Klaus" incident in a new light.

- **PAGE COUNT:** 3 pages

- John and Yoko approach a post office counter. John quietly mails his MBE medal back to the Palace.
- His voiceover reads the now-famous letter, protesting Britain's involvement in global conflicts and "Cold Turkey" slipping down the charts.
- **PURPOSE:** The Midpoint. John's act of defiance turns the tables. He isn't just a fractured pop star; he's a political dissident.
- **PAGE COUNT:** 2 pages

**SCENE 23: "The Package"** - BUCKINGHAM PALACE, PHILIP'S STUDY - DAY

- A palace aide delivers the returned medal to Prince Philip.
- Philip reads the letter. His face, which should be triumphant, contorts with cold fury. He didn't just win; he was rejected. The personal insult is now a public humiliation. "He spat on it. He spat on *her*."

- **PAGE COUNT:** 4 pages

**SCENE 24: "A Change in Terms"** - BUCKINGHAM PALACE PRIVATE STUDY - NIGHT

- Philip is terrifyingly calm. "The objective was to neutralize a nuisance. Instead, we have created a political symbol."

## **ACT III: THE FAILURE AND THE FALLOUT (1970 & BEYOND)**

### **SEQUENCE 8: "A VERY BRITISH SOLUTION" (Early 1970)**

**SCENE 26: "The Pigeon Gambit"** - MI5 SAFE HOUSE - DAY (January 1970)

- In a symmetrically framed, desaturated room, Clive enthusiastically diagrams his masterpiece on a chalkboard. The plan—"Operation Elegy"—is a needlessly complex machine involving a UNICEF concert, a distracting spotlight (the "Ono Obfuscation"), and a marksman (the "Pigeon Gambit").
- Clive, the failed artist turned intelligence officer, speaks with theatrical fervor, using invented jargon ("aesthetic penetration," "psychological ricochet") to describe what is essentially a hit.
- Nigel, a study in bureaucratic melancholy, recognizes the plan's absurdity as its greatest weakness. He feigns professional concern, arguing for simpler, more "classic" methods, subtly trying to steer the mission toward a less spectacular, more manageable form of failure.
- **PURPOSE:** To satirize the absurdity of bureaucracy by showcasing a needlessly complex assassination plot, and to solidify Nigel's role as a moral saboteur using the system's own logic against it.
- **PAGE COUNT:** 4 pages

**SCENE 27: "A Certain Symmetry"** - BUCKINGHAM PALACE PRIVATE STUDY - DAY (February 1970)

- In the rigid, silent order of the study, Sir Derek presents the plan.
- Mountbatten, the old-world strategist, dismisses it as amateurishly theatrical.
- Philip, however, is captivated. His personal obsession overrides military logic. He is drawn to the plan's cruel, artistic nature, seeing a "certain symmetry" in destroying a performer with a performance. He gives the order.
- **PURPOSE:** To show that the mission is no longer about statecraft but is now driven by the petty, aesthetic whims of a powerful man, highlighting the theme of corrupt, personalized power.
- **PAGE COUNT:** 2 pages

**SCENE 28: "Sub-Optimal Equipment"** - MI5 Q-BRANCH - DAY (February 1970)

- A Wes Anderson-style deep dive into institutional decay. Percy Dalton's storeroom is meticulously organized but filled with obsolete junk.
- Clive requests a state-of-the-art weapon. Percy, more concerned with his triplicate forms than the mission's success, lectures him on protocol before issuing them an antique, beautiful, but notoriously unreliable 1930s hunting rifle.
- **PURPOSE:** To visually and comedically demonstrate the theme of institutional folly. The conspiracy is doomed not by morality, but by budget cuts and bad equipment.
- **PAGE COUNT:** 2 pages

### **SEQUENCE 9: "THE PERFORMANCE" (March 1970)**

**SCENE 29: "Instant Karma"** - CONCERT HALL (DRESSING ROOM / RAFTERS / LIGHTING BOOTH / STAGE) - NIGHT

- The climax, intercutting between the chaotic, warm, organic world of the artists and the sterile, rigid, desaturated world of the spies.
- **THE STAGE:** John and Yoko, small figures on a vast stage, begin a simple, hopeful song.
- **THE RAFTERS:** Clive and the OPERATIVE are framed in a tight, symmetrical shot, the antique rifle a ridiculous prop in their serious tableau.
- **THE LIGHTING BOOTH:** A sterile, humming box where Nigel, the personification of bureaucratic melancholy, prepares to execute his counter-plan.
- **THE COLLISION:** On Clive's signal, Nigel's sabotage floods the stage with chaotic, blinding light. Yoko, embracing the chaos as performance art, emits a primal scream. The visual and auditory chaos disrupts the rigid plan.
- **THE PUNCHLINE:** The startled Operative fires wide, the bullet pathetically ripping the "PEACE" banner. The grand assassination plot fails with a whimper.
- **PURPOSE:** The central dramatic question is answered. The authentic, chaotic rebellion of art inadvertently defeats the soulless, absurd machinery of the state.
- **PAGE COUNT:** 10 pages

### **SEQUENCE 10: "LOOSE ENDS AND AN ISLAND" (Spring 1970)**

**SCENE 30: "Cauterize the Wound"** - MI5 DEBRIEFING ROOM - DAY (March 1970)

- The brutal comedy of failure. In a stark, deadpan wide shot, Philip's impotent fury clashes with Sir Derek's smooth, responsibility-deflecting corporate-speak.
- Mountbatten, the pragmatist, coolly announces the need to "cauterize the wound," a clinical euphemism for erasing the mission and its agents. No one accepts blame; the institution simply protects itself.
- **PURPOSE:** To satirize the soulless nature of power, where colossal failure results not in justice, but in a quiet, bureaucratic cleanup.
- **PAGE COUNT:** 2 pages

**SCENE 31: "The Falklands Desk"** - DREARY OFFICE, FALKLAND ISLANDS - DAY (May 1970)

- The ultimate soul-crushing office job. Nigel and Clive are framed in perfect, miserable symmetry at identical desks in a desolate, forgotten corner of the empire.
- They hear the news of The Beatles' breakup on a crackly radio. Clive is broken, his masterpiece ending in administrative exile. Nigel, the moral victor, has "won" a life sentence of tedious paperwork.
- **PURPOSE:** A perfect *Patriot*-style existential punchline. The grand drama of spies and rock stars ends in the quiet melancholy of middle-management.
- **PAGE COUNT:** 2 pages

**SCENE 32: "The Crown Endures"** - BUCKINGHAM PALACE - QUEEN'S SITTING ROOM - DAY (May 1970)

- The Queen, the embodiment of the story's visual and emotional restraint, sits in her perfectly ordered room.
- She delivers the story's thesis to a defeated Philip: the individual's emotional vendetta is a fleeting folly; the institution, by remaining above the fray, endures.
- **PURPOSE:** The thematic resolution. The chaotic artist and the obsessed royal have both been exhausted by the conflict, but the soulless, patient machinery of the state grinds on, unchanged.
- **PAGE COUNT:** 2 pages

### **EPILOGUE**

**SCENE 33: "Imagine"** - VARIOUS LOCATIONS & FALKLANDS OFFICE - (1970-1980)

- **MONTAGE:** Set to the simple, hopeful piano of "Imagine," we see the Beatles finding their messy, human, separate peaces. The visual style is warm and organic.
- **FINAL SCENE - NIGHT (DECEMBER 8, 1980):** A hard cut back to the cold, symmetrical, fluorescent hell of the Falklands office. An older Nigel and Clive hear the news of John's murder by a "deranged fan."
- They share a look. It's the ultimate dark, cynical, cosmic joke. The vast, absurd machinery of the state failed, but a lone, random lunatic succeeded.
- **PURPOSE:** To deliver the final, satirical gut-punch. History is not shaped by grand conspiracies, but by tragic, senseless absurdity.
- **FINAL TITLE CARD:** "There is no evidence the British Monarchy or intelligence services had any involvement in the death of John Lennon."
- **PAGE COUNT:** 1 page
